Studied a bit of Buddhism. Some very interesting concepts there worth considering. Not a huge fan of it in its entirety though. 



But Islam is like every other religion. You have the ideology/religion itself, and then you have the politics and the people using it for power, etc. If you can't separate the two then you are going to be manipulated.



The middle east is a political disaster. Most countries there are run by despots and puppets. These migrants going into Europe and Canada are really not good citizens. A lot of them aren't even good Muslims or at all Muslims...



And there is an astounding amount of propaganda against Islam. Researching it is very very difficult without running into FUD.



But when I study it deeply there is so much wisdom...life saving wisdom...forget whether or not you believe in God. 



Anyways, I'll leave it there. It's a huge can of worms and not something I take on lightly. I've applied even more critical thinking towards religion than anything else. And I've known far more atheists than anything else so I hear argument after argument after argument and if I couldn't refute them all I wouldn't support Islam.

Firstly, I would like BCH to gain its value organically, just as BTC has done since 2009. I would also like BCH to prove its a day to day currency and just get on with it. I see no merit or justification in BCH or B2X becoming Bitcoin. There is room enough for BTC and BCH to coexist. Your comparison lacks the necessary content. Fact: All investors are greedy, they have to be, they just need to control their greed so they don't get burned. That kind of greed is generally harmless to others. Greed takes on a more sinister shape when it comes to greed that harms others, harm their interests and investments. 



Advocate of core developers? I guess you could say that, they may not be white and shiney but they deserve support at this juncture. Down votes are expected, and I'll take them like man :)  It seems you didn't get the memo. Are you not aware of the plan of action come 2X day? Heres the game plan as leaked from China. Chinese miners under the leadership of Generalissimo Wu and the BU mining operation (funded and propped up by Ambassador Ver) will swing all hash power over to B2X so BTC transactions will slow down to a crawl, slowly eroding BTC value and user confidence, then B2X value will increase. Meanwhile an already hard-forked and improved BCH will be pumped even higher through Bithumb. Then at some point BTC users will get nervous and dump into B2X, then Generalissimo Wu, will command his side to swing over to BCH and leave B2X to flounder with BTC, then users will get nervous and dump into BCH. Thats the game plan and it will happen, how successful it will be will depend upon what move Blockstream/Core developers will make, and they will make a move. So come 2X day, it will be all or nothing. The biggest losers may be the ones holding big bags of BCH. Personally, I hope that somehow 2X fizzles and BCH won't get its chance to be scammy and leach off the success of BTC. BTC remains BTC, B2X dies a quick death and that litecoin or Dash become the day to day currency we are looking for. Getting back to your opening line, nope, it's the BCH supporters that are being misled by Ver and BU. ",17-11-04-14-42,1,0,[deleted],7aoi21,126,0.102,0.13,0.768,0.9682

I think there is room enough for BCH, BTG and B2X, but they should make their mark on their own merits and not use a scammy coordinated aggressive effort to take over BTC, doing so is a dangerous game with just a handful of winners. If it fails, and it probably will, those holding the biggest bags of BCH will be the biggest losers. ",17-11-04-14-42,1,0,[deleted],7aoi21,127,0.129,0.083,0.788,-0.7974
128,"Your right, normally BCH or any other crypto could not dethrone Bitcoin. Whilst users can decide which coin is more useful a majority mining group can reduce a coins usefulness if it wanted to. But this is not a normal situation and a majority mining group does want to reduce Bitcoin usefulness.



Here are the facts:

1. BU wants BCH to replace and become BTC

2. Bloq wants B2X to replace and become BTC

3. The majority mining group, Bitman and co, wants BCH to replace and become BTC

4. Faux satoshi, Craig Wright, wants BCH to replace and become BTC

5. John McAfee, wants BCH to replace and become BTC.

6. Roger Ver and his Bitcoin.com mining pool wants BCH to replace and become BTC.



All of the above have their own mining resources they will use them to support BCH, all of the above have the own greedy motives for wanting BCH to become BTC. If ANY of the above just wanted BCH to become a true 'Satoshi white paper' P2P currency they would focus on doing that and leave the users to decide which one they want, BTC or BCH or both. No, they won't allow users to decide and they will use Bitmain during the B2X chaos to decide the outcome. Bitmain (Chinese centralised mining pools) will initially support B2X because it wants BTC to weaken with minority hash power. Then when BTC weakens Bitmain will swing hash power over to BCH to weaken B2X.  Meanwhile BCH will be pumped, EDA removed and ready to make its final attack a weakened BTC and B2X. Users will panic sell BTC into BCH and slowly BCH will gain majority user support. But their hands will be forced, it won't be because they want BCH over BTC. 



The main danger in this aggressive move that BU is planning for BCH is the altcoin market, their investors will loose a large portion of their investment. How many BCH/alt and B2X/alt trading pairs do you see on the exchanges now and how many will there be come 2X day? So when BTC's value is reduced what happens to the alts? Their value also reduces. Users will panic try to sell the alts back into BTC or ETH, then at some point when they buy into BCH they will be buying in at a premium price level. More money is lost. If you have an investment in altcoins now, and all this plays out as planned, you could loose a massive amount of your altcoin investment. The big winners will be an exodus pumped ETH and BCH. But will BCH have deserved to win, no because it was turned into a scam coin by BU and used market manipulation to get where it is. I am hoping Blockstream has an answer to all of this and somehow thwarts these aggressive moves. ",17-11-04-14-42,1,0,[deleted],7aoi21,128,0.134,0.1,0.766,-0.9625

If BCH price goes up, a small amount of hash rate will switch from BTC to BCH robbing BTC of hash rate causing slower blocks on the BTC chain. Another bump in price, more hash rate moves. You get the picture?

355,"BCH is a relatively low risk coin to be in. Yes, it drops in value but it's still worth $1600 even after a protracted drop. Much like Bitcoin, it is down some 50% from its ATH now, but that's just a temporary dip.



But if you're looking for maximum returns, you need to take more risks. You need to find the new altcoins with potential, and get in on the ground floor, and ride those to 10x-100x gains. The trick is figuring out which is which, and you may wind up betting on something that never takes off.



There is pretty much zero doubt in my book that BCH will go right back up when people get over this FUD attack. Many people even predict it will still unseat Bitcoin BTC, just because that one is so broken.

707,"From a technical perspective Bitcoin ""Cash"" is the original Bitcoin outlined by Satoshi. Why not just drop the ""Cash"" and use a different ticker like BIT or XBT \(as used by Bloomberg for Bitcoin\). In Forex the ""X"" is significant for being associated with no state i.e. stateless , with the remaining letters left for the asset name.



In the altcoin space when two projects have the same name they are differentiated by their ticker symbols. I see no reason why Bitcoin should have Cash at the end of it when a simple ticker change would suffice. In common language exchange it would make more sense to introduce the asset as Bitcoin ""XBT"" rather Bitcoin Cash because it introduces the other party to the ticker symbol rather than a useless postfix.



IMO, using the XBT symbol would be better than BTC, BIT or BCH because it is in\-line with international FOREX standards and would be strategic move to force Bloomberg to cover the real Bitcoin under that ticker rather than the pretenders using the BTC ticker.",18-05-18-04-27,2,0,[deleted],8k6j50,707,0.039,0.103,0.858,0.8694

I even sent my TXid to two transaction accelerator services offered by mining pools. Still took 12 hours after that to get my transaction confirmed. This is insane. The same dollar value in BCH got transferred within 5 minutes at USD0.01 per kB which cost me USD 0.00!



It is just unfortunate years were spent building the merchant infrastructure and crypto ecosystem around what has come along to be the bitcoin core. It should be called bit coin cancer instead 



People will realize when they see how slow and ridiculously expensive BTC transactions are. If you tell em like it is on r/bitcoin then your post will get deleted. I felt really sad seeing a screenshot on r/bitcoin of someone screenshotting how well their bitcoin investment under $50 was doing. Nobody even mentioned how that would get eaten up in fees to get the transaction to even get through within an hour. If I tried to post about it, either the post would get deleted by the mods or there would be a swarm of posts about how lightning and segwit has fixed this. No it hasnt, despite talk about lightning for years.This is the unfortunate state of r/bitcoin. A post of mine that wasnt even bashing BTC got deleted by mods within minutes.

Consider a few other things:



1) If you actually look at the daily transactions for BCH, it pales in comparison to BTC, it‚Äôs not even close.  Hardly anyone uses BCH.  From a fundamental valuation standpoint, BCH should trade at a fraction of BTC‚Äôs price.



2) Once second layer protocols are enabled, how will BCH keep up with BTC technologically.  An instant transaction with de minimums fees using lightning network on BTC will be better than current fees and 10 min confirmations on BCH right?

Here is what I'm thinking/hoping:



There is going to be one last ""pump"" and a fierce dump before the BitcoinCash update at 7PM GMT. Hopefully bringing the price back up to 1500/1600, after that the price will fall back to sub 1000. There are massive buy walls at 800/900 so I doubt it will fall back all the way to 600. Whales will come in after the update and buy all the cheap BitcoinCash there is and it will again rise to over 1000.



Ofcourse this all based on pure speculation, there is no saying wether it will happen or not. You shouldn't have bought in that high, all you can do right now is, in my opinion, *damage control*.

818,"Congrats on freeing yourself from the debt trap! You are richer than many by that fact alone, because your true wealth is your time, the ability to do with it the things you want.



I sympathize with your request for help as it's not easy to live debt free when not classified as already super rich (the debt system works against you). Please don't take this the wrong way, but there is a reason the rules in the sidebar of most crypto subreddits expressly forbid asking for donations. In the first place it's difficult to tell real from fake stories, but secondly even real stories wouldn't be encouraged because the ratio of people ready to ask for money for some cause versus ready to give would probably be 10 million to 1, lol.



I would offer advice and encouragement, though. The greatest value you have is the control over your land. That's where wealth starts. The things any human needs are food, water and shelter. By having your own land, and a lot of it at that, you can address these items, but more importantly, possibly produce abundance. You seem to be thinking that way by mentioning the honey. You may not be aware two teenage boys had some success selling homemade honey online for Bitcoin from the earliest days:



https://www.coindesk.com/sweet-success-for-bees-brothers-worlds-youngest-bitcoin-entrepreneurs/



So there is a possibility of producing products which may be sold online. That would be the most obvious way to convert the wealth of your land into extra usable currency IMO. It might also be possible to produce items which can be sold more locally. This is an idea I've been working on in the back of my mind for years. Eventually I hope people can more easily generate their own wealth and exchange things of value with one another, all ideally without any middlemen or tax obligations as that would let people keep the greatest portion of their generated wealth. Someone in your position is one part of the puzzle. A viable honest currency like Bitcoin Cash is another part. The last part, where someone like myself comes in, is some vehicle such as a website where connections are made and commerce can happen. All these things are slowing coming together. So be encouraged! Again, congrats!



EDIT: I almost forgot, another part of the puzzle is micro loans which could be used to get people going once things were in place; that would more directly address your post, but I'm working on things like that too.

Bitcore totally destroys Bitcoin Cash in every way. Bitcore is not only faster than Bitcoin Cash, at 20 MB blocksize Bitcore absolutely destroys Bitcoin Cash. Bitcore also has Segwit and Bloom activated and here's the biggest advantage of Bitcore...price!!! Bitcore is currently trading around the $15 mark. It was around $2 in September. Would you rather drop $1300 on a slower Bitcoin Cash with less blocksize or would you rather buy a $15 Bitcore coin with the best growth yet to come? 



Every Monday Bitcore has an airdrop. All you need to do is download the wallet, buy some Bitcore from exchange and transfer them to your wallet. During the month of November, you will receive a 3% airdrop directly into your wallet. In December the airdrop will increase to 4% airdrop every Monday. In January the airdrop will increase to 5% every Monday. In February it will increase to 6% every Monday and it will continue increasing by 1% every month until all of the coins have been distributed. 



- BitCore BTX Specs

- 21 Million Coin

- 10 min Blocktime later 2,5 min

- DefaultPort = 8555 - RPC 40332

- Halving from BTC Block 462987 = BTX Block 1

- Segwit and Bloom online

- Core 0.14 

- 20 MB Blocksize (10 MB + 10 MB Segwit)

- Algo Timetravel10

- Diff Retarget: Bitcore 64_15

- halving interval like BTC 1:1 BTX start with 12.5 BTC per block



One more thing, Bitcore will be a top 100 coin as soon as Coin Market Cap updates the correct numbers on their site. Stop messing around with Bitcoin Cash, which is already obsolete when compared to Bitcore. Be smart with your money and go with Bitcore. If you were holding Bitcoin in a wallet where you hold the private key at the time of the snapshot, you can still claim you free BTX. I believe that it's .5 BTX for every 1 BTC.

I hope Korea's class action lawsuit wins out in the end. Nobody deserves to lose money like that. 



And in my honest opinion, BCH was being manipulated to a certain extent, so we can call it a PUMP, but it should never have DUMPED below a normal profit taking correction.  



FYI, BCH would have reached $3500 to $4500 if the exchanges didn't go down. And would have stabilized in around $2800 to $3200 taking Ethereum  out of the 2nd market cap spot. ",17-11-15-03-51,3,0,[deleted],7cwwoh,910,0.102,0.219,0.679,0.9644

919,"Not all of it, but it does seem like the pump was very much orchestrated; they do point that out and they're not wrong. They're not even wrong in that it is mildly distasteful, but where they do go wrong is that they don't even acknowledge the vast damage done by BTC Core and the bullshit No2X campaign that prevented going to 2M blocks after segwit was already in. That is what made the necessity to push BCH so immediate.



Not even Bitcoin operates in a vacuum. There are major competitors coming up who don't have the name, but have potentially superior functionality. Bitcoin can't be dysfunctional at this time in the game, something had to be done.



That doesn't really change the equation much. BCH is holding comfortably at $1200+ in spite of BTC going up in value, so it's not going anywhere at this point. 



BTC, meanwhile, still won't be able to operate much longer without doing an emergency hard fork to do something. Most likely increase the block size after all, or change the PoW... something. And after 3 years of propaganda in the BTC camp about how forks/upgrades are bad mmkay and the very recent No2X campaign, the BTC community will tear itself apart if they even try to fork.

I'm also mining to GPU coins. I'm getting paid it whatever currency they offer then turn them into BCC. A low but steady income for me to invest into alts.



Why would that be different for miners of Bitcoin algorithm? Why they should hold BCH instead of turning them to BCT or fiat as they are doing for a long time? ",17-11-15-03-51,3,0,[deleted],7cwwoh,932,0.074,0.062,0.864,-0.3707

934,"The reason profitability is such a big deal is because miners were abusing the difficulty adjustment, would slow down hashrate, wait for difficulty to go down to increase profitability above BTC, and then when everyone joined in on mining BCH they would mine a ton of blocks until it adjusted back up and rinse and repeat. Eventually they kept the profitability just below BTC so mine more coins. Now that we have the upgraded DAA, we can have a steady coin, AKA a coin that doesn't drop down in price due to unstable hashrate. Now that it has a steady hashrate/difficulty combination, it allows the coin to stabilize a price.



Now the question becomes, what will the next price pump bring? Because if it brings another 400% increase in price, miners will make 4x the profit mining BCH (they sell coins usually immediately) and during this entire pump, Core will start to feel the increased effects of blocks stalling. However, I assume they will survive the next BCH pump with a few days of little to no hashrate, but over time the period they stall will get larger as BCH grows until it loses the war.



So for the simple answer, because the DAA was destroying the stability of our coin, and now we are receiving healthy profitability that isn't artificial (from DAA abuse). I disregarded your ""chain death spiral risk"" comment for obvious reasons. As for why BCH guys won't ""dump BCH when they have some incentive to do so"". It really doesn't matter does it? The price went from $300 to $2500 over 5 days and is still resting at $1200. It's consolidation after a healthy pump. The next price increase proves to look pretty damn high based on Elliot Wave. 



Think of this, the only way Core can prevent BCH taking over right now, is to either shit on them (which isn't working), increase the price of their own coin by having Segwit work, or rely on the difficulty adjustment to save them which won't help them if they can't continue producing blocks to get to it. They can fix that by hard forking and implementing a DAA, but they have showed they absolutely hate hard forks.",17-11-15-03-51,8,0,[deleted],7cwwoh,934,0.156,0.104,0.74,-0.9732

For transactions that occur during a mempool backlog, the window of time during which foul play can occur is dramatically increased for BTC. Instead of ~10 minutes, a bad actor may now have hours or days in which to pull a fast one. E.g. double spends with the aid of a colluding miner would have a success rate, on average, equal to their share of the hash power *multiplied* by six *times* the number of hours by which the transaction would otherwise be delayed (six being the number of 10 minute periods in an hour). I suppose the BTC merchant could insist on a high transaction fee to mitigate this attack, but then you are no longer comparing risk among equivalent transactions.





EDIT: I realize that math is not technically correct, but you get the idea.

I am doing this because I believe cryptocurrency should be freedom and free of censorships. Bitcoin has been hijacked by banks and corporations. I am not going to stand by and do nothing just because they have tried to silence my voice. The way to fight censorships is to be more vocal about it. 3 things cannot be long hidden; the sun, the moon and the truth.

Just not heard anything out LCC and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much info out there about the hard fork and what problem it is intended to resolve. I always thought LTC was pretty efficient as a currency.

Elevator pitch: There isn't currently a fast-blocks, cheap-transactions SHA256 currency with decent difficulty retargeting. People have older SHA256 hardware either gathering dust or with very limited choices of places to send their hashpower.

1348,"1. BTC isn't viable as a form of exchange, as it stands. Future developments and upgrades (multiple layers, lightning, etc.) will, hopefully, solve underlying issues which revolve around fees and transaction times (also, I'm not sure if you know, but it's actually pretty quick atm). The main issue, and it's not really an issue, is that BTC is growing as such an exponential rate - increased adoption means increased strain on the system.



The reason why Bcash hasn't faced such issues yet, is because it hasn't been as adopted as BTC.



1.2-Focus on the technology, investments, confidence, and development of the cryptocurrency. Don't focus on who supports what. God himself could come down and support Dogecoin - dos this mean Dogecoin is superior?



2-To be honest, I don't see anything wrong with investments coming from private entities. The point of block chain tech and Bitcoin was never to kill a currency - more just to live alongside it, being a stable, efficient and ethical means of exchange. For example, the 2nd largest commercial bank of South Korea only just started investing in Bitcoin vaults and wallets. 



Moreover, if you want to throw mud around, you could also look at Roger Ver's and Mt Gox - quite shady stuff going on there. Living just across the street from the offices, and went in to ""help"" conveniently at the time when the coins were stolen? Hmmm. Now saying everything is fine with Gox? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

BCH, at the moment, can do what BTC does but better. Only time will tell whether it will in the future, but I think it will, at least longer than Bitcoin has.



When you think about it, there isn't much of a reason for either to exist. Bitcoin is the popular kid, the network effect creates this dilemma. There isn't a reason for both coins to exist, but there isn't a reason for both to exist (other than the network effect/adoption), so conflict occurs.



All we can do is support who we think is better. That will make the market the best. Supporting a coin that isn't better hurts the market.

1390,"BCH has a different scaling solution than the other bigger boys, so it has a place in the market. BCH could have similar scaling issues to BTC (or different ones), but only time will tell. We know that Litecoin **will** have the same issues in scaling, but the debate there is whether or not Litecoin will be able to hit its shorter target block time and still be faster than BTC. And honestly, the reason LTC isn't bigger than BTC is the network effect. There is no reason for the ""silver to gold"" anology (as litecoin can be both, it is basically an upgraded bitcoin); it is just a way to justify our situation, similar to scientists making the data fit the model instead of making the model fit the data, but this is irrelevant to the discussion so I digress.



Also, more people are using/accepting BCH. It's pretty much a question of ""do the ends justify the means?""



If BCH got to where it is using the Bitcoin name (this is justifiable depending on if you think that people can choose the real Bitcoin), does it matter if it works and is adopted? I feel like the people that argue this are threatened because they have altcoin investments that could be hurt by BCH.

I'm not talking about miners doing double spends themselves, I'm talking about a miner who simple mines the highest fee transaction he sees, when there are 2 competing ones.



The people attempting the double spends can't guarantee that the double spends will happen but there's no cost in trying.

There is no ""the mempool"", each node and miner has their own and they can be quite different from each other.



>it's not going to be easy to counterfeit or double spend unless you can use RBF, which you cannot in BCH.



It's hard because there are no miners allowing it, yes. But that means you're trusting all miners to continue this behavior, that's a trustful system.

You don't know what you're talking about, sorry for being blunt. There is no way to define what is the ""original transaction"" and as such the protocol cannot possibly enforce it.

0-conf with RBF has zero security since it‚Äôs trivial to use RBF to replace a transaction before the block is validated. That's why 0-conf is no longer used in BTC. But it used to be both useful and very popular before RBF was implemented. 



0-conf without RBF isn't as secure as a full miner validated transaction but it‚Äôs quite hard to exploit successfully these days.

in short, because nobody but heavy duty crypto nerds give a significant shit about the difference. 



this is basically a religious difference.  this denomination says IT is the real, accurate and correct version, and this other denomination who has different intepretations of various things says IT is the real accurate and correct one. 

both originated from the same place, and you could say, forked at a point when enough people had appropriately diverging opinions. 



both say they are the right one.  

neither is entirely right, neither is entirely wrong.  



>calling that irrelevant is like saying the difference between pasta bolognaise and pizza is meaningless...



theres people who feel that way about different denominations of Christianity too.  



they aren't nearly that distinct man.  To an outsider, they are practically the same.  

Protestants,  Catholics and Mormons are ALL christians too.



I get that the differences seem huge and important.   I am not even saying that you are entirely wrong in fact or in feeling that way.  but neither are they.

Pizza hut and <insert super authentic fancy handmade pizza place> might have major differences and to a pizza connoisseur, especially, would be greatly important differences.

I see where you are coming from, but I am more of the opinion that Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash can both call their coins ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù when context makes it clear or when the distinction doesn‚Äôt matter.

This is the way it has always been done with Linux forks and other open source projects, so I don‚Äôt see why it should be any different with bitcoin. The only real difference is that bitcoin attracts lots of people from outside the open source community so this naming convention seems wrong to people who are used to thinking about brands and  companies.

> So many alts can do what BCH can do and much more. 



BCH has the best technology hands down. It also has more merchant adoption than any other alt. BCH trading pairs are popping up more and more. Its easily incorporated into existing BTC infrastructure like BTM‚Äôs and POS machines. Merchants that already accept BTC are switching to BCH, not fucking LTC or Dash. BCH contains the original bitcoin blockchain and it is closer to satoshis vision of bitcoin (as stated in the white paper) than Bitcoin Segwit will ever be.



As for lightning network, it‚Äôs a theory/concept that has many flaws. There are many ways that lightning network can fail. BCH already exists and solves the issues with bitcoin better than lightning network could. Why switch from a stable working solution to an unstable concept? This stuff was never outlined in the white paper. Satoshi said bigger blocks and chain of digital signatures, not fucking Segwit and lightning network. Lightning network isn‚Äôt proven, BCH is, and it‚Äôs restored more to satoshis original vision than BTC ever could be at this point. 



It goes back to the concept of; if something isn‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. Blockstream screwed up BTC by disregarding the chain of digital signatures, introducing Segwit, and now you‚Äôre supposed to trust them that their fictitious lightning network is the answer? Open your eyes! They‚Äôre selling a dream so that more people continue to invest in bitcoin Segwit under false hope that it will have a bright future. Bitcoin Segwit has become something for people to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in,

hoping someone will come in and ‚Äúinvest‚Äù after them at a higher price so that they can turn a profit. It‚Äôs become very ponzi-esque, and I for one don‚Äôt like it. Plus, guess what happens if you turn a profit and try to withdraw it? You get smoked with fees and ridiculous waiting periods for transactions to be confirmed, and by the time it does, the extremely volatile ‚Äústore of wealth‚Äù could have dropped in value turning your profits even more red. 



BTC shills say ‚Äúwell i can just transfer to LTC and then that gets confirmed faster and I can transact that way‚Äù - WTF Kind of solution is that? Seriously! Now you‚Äôre paying an additional fee to exchange BTC to LTC as well as the LTC transaction fee (which is higher than BCH, btw) when you could have done that simple transaction with BCH and it would be a lot easier, faster and inexpensive.",17-12-13-20-47,3,0,[deleted],7ji7ex,1786,0.057,0.147,0.796,0.9902

Personally I think the BCH**POW** version will persist and maintain dominance.  One reason is outlined in this excellent paper by Nchain, titled [Proof of Work as it relates to the Theory of the Firm](https://nchain.com/en/blog/proof-work-relates-theory-firm/).



> Oligopoly grows when the individual parties in the system can set the rules in such a way that they can 

restrict entry to new players. In the case of a proof of Stake-based system, the ability to withhold funds 

for large entities leads to a high barrier to entry. In a situation such as that which has evolved in 

Ethereum, a single large player in a proof of stake system can set the rules. The aim of any oligopoly is 

to  maximise  profits.  In  general,  oligopoly  form businesses  set  barriers  to  entry  using  government 

licenses, economies of scale, patents, access to expensive and complex and highly capitalised systems 

and  technology  and predatory behaviours.  Government  regulation is  also one of the major factors 

influencing this form of system.  



> Proof of stake allows players to form protective cartels. In competitive environments cartels breakdown 

naturally. Proof of stake can be created in a non-competitive manner. Even if the system starts off 

competitively, it is the nature of an oligopoly to seek abnormal profits and this can be achieved through 

the manipulation of the rules over time. Such manipulation can result in increasing levels of control as 

the incumbent firms ensure that innovation does not change or disrupt the status quo. 



> The system degrades into oligarchy. This is a power structure with rule by a small number of people. It 

is what the Greeks in the time of Aristotle called a tyranny. A more common name today would be a 

plutocracy. The proof of stake system is a form of oligarchy that represents societal control by a small 

number of wealthy individuals. ",18-03-08-03-34,6,0,[deleted],82pl7p,1913,0.04,0.125,0.835,0.9874

Opening a wallet means locking 1 XLM. There's no privacy.

Any PoS coin promotes the idea of trickle-down economy which isn't sustainable.



Nano/RaiBlocks - still not proven enough. It is possible to spam the network and grind it to a halt. From what I know it is a combination of PoW and PoS, so whoever has a significant amount of XRB will continue to receive it.



IOTA - still in experimental phase.



VertCoin, GroestlCoin - promising, but have very low adoption, and price is very volatile. Hashrate can be taken over by a large GPU farm.

Not sure what you're getting at here.  Ponzi schemes have nothing to do with the composition of the investors.  Plenty of adults, including veteran investors, were taken in by Madoff.  I doubt a single child invested in his scheme.

I don't think day trading is a good choice-- it's difficult and dangerous, and it's more rewarding the more capital you have, like percentage gains on $10 is just pennies. With day trading the service you're offering the market is providing some liquidity (just like making coins available for people to buy/sell) and hopefully maybe making the prices a little more rational by buying on senseless dips and selling on senseless rises. That *is* a useful service, the only problem is that as you can see there are *lots* of people providing that service, which means you're very likely to be competed out of the market. If nobody at all was already trading crypto to make money, like if everyone was just making naive exchanges when they need to change coins, then you could easily go stand between the buyers and sellers and help reduce the spread and make the market function and get paid. But because there are a *lot* of people already trying to make money that way, there's no obvious opportunities left there.



With what little I know about you my feeling is that your most marketable attribute is cuteness, tbh. People here love the idea of a teenager getting crypto, they're totally rooting for you. What you need is just like to prove that you exist, if that makes sense-- pics or it didn't happen! If for instance you made a youtube show talking about crypto and ended with a QR code (make sure it's an address that you have the private keys very safe), you could easily get $10 or more of donations every show. If you can't afford video equipment, you could see if maybe there's a local cable access station where you can film, they might even have a nice set to make your show look good, or maybe you could ask someone with a camera to film you and split the proceeds with them, it's always good to get more people involved. :)",17-12-25-06-51,1,0,[deleted],7lx3cu,2084,0.026,0.164,0.81,0.9939

But it also clogs up the comment section with all the bot replies (which the bot owner isn't likely to get rid of since it's advertising) and it can actually have a negative effect on morale if somebody posts in a thread where many tips are handed out and they don't receive anything (or gets tipped less than everybody else).



Tipping can have especially negative effects if people start expecting tips for posting information instead of just wanting to share the information just for the sake of sharing. If they expect tips and don't get them they will eventually post less. It's like IRL professions where people start expecting to get tips just for doing their job; if they don't get it they get annoyed and start performing worse.

Due to the fact that NAGA‚Äôs Ecosystem will give access to 2 billion underbanked users to participate in the financial and crypto markets, it will allow everyone to get into trading and investing and it will result in their potential independent individual lifestyle, which supports the idea of libertarianism that is embraced by Roger.

The only reason any of this crap is worth more than pennies, is because some of us think it will have a future use as money.  



Right now, BCH is not useful.  You can buy BCH and once you have your BCH you can do... what exactly?  Trade it back for fiat or other crypto?  



What we are missing is the ability to easily SPEND crypto.  Coinbase and BitPay started on that a few years ago, but both only accept BTC.  And since blocks got full, spending BTC on a retail transaction (even online) is an exercise in frustration and high fees.  Without payment processors, crypto is only useful as a settlement system or remittance system.  



What interests me is the future.  What interests me is the day when I can walk into any random store and see a sign saying 'we take Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Crypto'.  If BCH is on that sign, we win.  If it's not, we lose, and are nothing more than a fancy open source project.  The same is true of Ethereum, Monero, Dash, and every other coin that's not accepted for transactions.  



Until then, the price of any of this stuff is only an indicator of how many people think that particular coin is going to be on the sign.  Given that much of the crypto market doesn't fully understand what makes BCH and BTC different, and you can't really spend BCH anywhere, it doesn't surprise me that BCH's value isn't that high.  



I don't think the dream is over.  I think BCH has a possible future.  plus which BCH is the most similar to BTC so if SegWit / Lightning fails, BCH is the most immediate backup plan.  



There is also the issue of SegWit2x.  It's hard to take the pulse of the crypto markets, because only a small percent participate in online discussions like Reddit.  But I do see here and in other places a lot of people fed up with Core's stonewalling of any block size increase no matter how small.  Should SegWit2x fail, I expect a lot more interest in BCH.  

(I still hope SW2x succeeds, because I think it would be good for Bitcoin- both to help scaling, and to adjust the politics of the ecosystem so Core becomes 'first among many' rather than 'the Deciders'.  I'd like to see a new decision making process that involves collaboration between implementations and stakeholders, rather than the current 'we are developers we are the only ones who can decide' situation where anyone else is written off as an attack.

It would be nice to have the fix in place before the fork next month, so BCH could work as a safe haven for people unsure about the BTC/B2C split. But I also understand that it is better to properly test such a fix than to rush something buggy into the market.

 Good luck with the flippening. It's never going to happen. There are too many BTC holders that won't even pay attention to this. You'll never be able to sink BTC's price far enough to accomplish this, especially now. Furthermore, bch cant even maintain mining rentability superiority over bitcoin for a long period of time, so good luck in keeping the miners that defect to bch. They will always come back to BTC, just like they did last time.

So if the BTC doesn't get distributed around (by people spending it) ... then what will happen? .... it becomes worth MORE and MORE, and the later and later adopters can only afford to buy smaller and smaller fractions of it.

It doesn't really matter if they understand up until this point in history considering the only way to buy BCH is through another coin until January. So clearly his post was to the hardcore fans that are reading Reddit. So I'm eager to hear what ""normies"" you are referring to?



""Unusable"" is a term, and you are changing the context for which jhm52 intended. He meant ""Unusable"" as we all would, the fact that the coin has so much of a backlog that anyone who even wants to sell right now CAN'T. ""Unusable"" as in you can't confirm a transaction, whether it be buy or sell. And one can argue that BTC is ""Unusable"" in your sense (ignoring the backlogged mempool) as I can't go buy things at Target with it. So again the 2nd point you made is invalid.



If you are exchanging as much BCH in a day as you're implying, you should probably read up on the statistics of mining the coin you are putting your future in. If you aren't aware of how BCH will replace BTC by now, you're probably hemorrhaging money or a liar.



PS: Based on your post history, you're a BTC fanboy and a BCH shill because your past 10 posts have all been in r/bitcoincash and have all been garbage FUD. What a miner, trashing the coin he is mining... right. Doesn't realize that BTC went to $11k and none of it matters because BCH is still equally profitable to mine, with the possibility to overtake BTC due to EDA.

This is an issue though. Technology is a means to an end, not the end itself. If the technology is Core's ultimate goal, then what are they building and do we want to use it? I don't think they know what they are building, and they certainly don't care if we can use it.

I think the world is closer to being ready every day, and when it happens, the digital currencies need to be ready, not perpetually ""18 months away"". 



This rolling readiness timeframe is, by the way, a byproduct of having no goal except the technology. The technology can always be improved. Always. But without goals, it will never be ready. Never.

>Being in a rush to buy coffee with your crypto is not worth sacrificing the technology.



Like it or not, there is a rush to buy coffee with crypto. The fiat system's days are numbered. We need something that will be ready when it all comes crashing down. Bitcoin was on track to be ready, up until the current Core leadership lost its focus on Bitcoin as money. BCH aims to set Bitcoin back on track but must replace Core as the dominant Bitcoin for that to happen.

A month ago it was holding steady at 10%. A month from now maybe it will be 25%. Then 40%, etc.  I may be wrong, but I believe Bitcoin Cash can and will eventually overtake Core.



>BTC is a technology that strives to change the world - BCH is an altcoin being used and abused to make people millions through exchange shenanigans and transaction spamming. Take your pick.



BTC has no such goal. They don't even care that 75% of the world can't afford a single transaction. Worse, they relish that fact. They're opening champagne bottles to celebrate it.  Bitcoin was designed to change the world, not alienate it.

Because it looks you are new to Bitcoin and also here on Reddit, you should have a look at the following thread from /r/Bitcoin back in 2015 (especially look at the comments and upvotes on the comments).



http://archive.is/0G8az



That poster of that thread (and moderator of /r/Bitcoin) that was heavily criticized is still the main moderator of that subbredit today, and that subbredit has a history for censorship banning people a lot. Do you think a censorship-resistant cryptocurrency should be discussed in a censored forum?



For a history of censorship of /r/Bitcoin , you should have a look at and read at least a few of the links from the following post:



https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5wwznc/please_read_our_frequently_asked_questions_faq/

2687,"Not necessarily. I'm mostly predicting that it is rather hard to predict if it will go up or down, especially in todays situation. The last years learned that betting against BTC has always been a bad idea, no matter what happened it always bounced. However, now there is a new coin which is directly compatible with BTC (its history, its name, its base tech including the PoW) and presents a different roadmap, so this is a new kind of hurdle for BTC. However, I'm predicting that chances are high (I'm not throwing in percentages) that BCH will see the 900 range again in the upcoming time (again, keeping it open, maybe days, maybe weeks). Also, I believe that chances are higher that BCH will move down when  BTC moves up. So if BTC would reach the 7k (‚Ç¨) then BCH will probably be in the 900 range. Again, these are predictions.

It's so fucking obvious that the elites are crashing markets simultaneously to try to acquire. Anyone selling into the pressure is obviously over leveraged or living beyond their means.



For anyone that lives within their means there exists an opportunity. Blood is in the streets. Consider dollar cost averaging into companies and currencies you believe in, but never go all in. Make sure you have a cushion to live your life (see r/personalfinance).

He's saying he'll invest just $1000 into the Vanguard Index VTSAX, an imposibility since Vanguard recently lowered the amount to invest from $10000 USD to $3000 USD. Impediment, oops.



He could argue that he meant an ETF like the VTI. Again, consider a source that makes amateur-like mistakes when considering the debaters.

You're thinking linearly, you should be thinking EXPONENTIALLY. There is a reason certain companies have grown exponentially. Because, they are using the latest technologies, and, because, they are replacing the dead companies (bloated and incapable of change). Read Peter Thiel's Zero to One or Ray Kurzweil's works on exponential growth.



I'll take $1000 in companies that are demonstrating and will from all available data continue to exhibit exponential growth, with leadership I believe in. Split it between Elon Musk's Tesla, Lisa Su's AMD, and Satoshi Nakamoto's original  intention behind Bitcoin (hint: it's not BTC)..

You can still trade BCH just fine on all exchanges, including this one. It's just not a base pair.

2956,"Non-mining nodes are relatively inexpensive to set up - they're basically just IP addresses - someone could theoretically set up thousands of them with a single copy of the blockchain, so wouldn't trusting them be a bad idea, and contrary to the warning against ""one IP one vote"" from section 4 of the [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)? Shouldn't we be primarily, if not completely, trusting miners that have significant financial investment and incentive to maintain the integrity of the network? There's basically no chance 100% of miners and their workers would be able to collude without an honest miner, a business such as an exchange, or an odd hobby node alerting the community to fraud, at which time the community would devalue the unwanted fork, add more hashpower and/or change the proof of work to make the mining equipment obsolete. I'm hesitant to think we need or should encourage a huge number of non-mining nodes.



Personally I think centralized exchanges and developers who make the code that runs their nodes currently largely determine which chains are valuable, as I mention [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/87kggk/nonmining_nodes_do_not_vote_for_consensus_nor_do/dwepo7s/), and other nodes and miners are relatively weak.

3041,"ABC's lead developer is named Amaury Sechet.  He's a pretty reasonable guy.  Just a unimpressive yet dedicated software developer, as were most early Bitcoiners.  His client was, until recently, the most popular bch client.  Companies like Bitmain and Bitcoin.com run ABC on their mining nodes.



nChain is run by a guy named Craig Wright who claimed he was Satoshi a few years back but never gave any proof.  He's generally obnoxious and offensive.  nChain released a competing BCH implementation called Bitcoin SV a few months ago.  His primary backer is a guy named Calvin Ayre, who made billions pioneering online gambling when the internet was young.



BCH was created after a prolonged debate about increasing the block size through a hard fork or activating something called segwit with no fork (I personally prefer BTC and segwit).  People had been calling for a fork to increase the block size since 2015, but were never able to reach enough consensus, so it didn't happen.  Out of this frustration, the people who created BCH decided there would be a hard fork every 6 months (which is really aggressive).



So with BCH you're basically signing up for a hard fork every 6 months.  That's scheduled to happen next week.  Right now, all the buzz is about making it possible to run smart contracts on BCH.  ABC wants to add a feature (opcode) called OP_DSV to do this.  Craig Wright didn't agree with this approach because he thinks it infringes on his patents, and by controlling 51% of the hash can essentially block any OP_DSV transactions from taking place.



It's not clear what will happen.  ABC could change the hashing algorithm or add replay protection, which would essentially create a new coin.  However, that wouldn't be a good look for a currency that claims to be the ""original bitcoin"" (which it's not IMHO).  Alternatively, someone like Bitmain could redirect their hash power from BTC and regain 51% of the hashrate, but that would be unprofitable.



I know it's wishful thinking, but I'm hoping that some of the BCH crowd realize they're getting a taste of their own medicine, and grudgingly return to BTC.  I think there's room for compromise.  If there's another surge, I personally think that a hard fork to increase the block size could reach consensus.  Segwit is a good technology, we're better equipped to implement features like smart contracts now. 

 However, I understand there were a lot of hard feelings on both sides, so I try to be respectful to people with different viewpoints than me.",18-11-12-07-56,5,0,[deleted],9w7e86,3041,0.118,0.103,0.779,-0.7409

3270,"The longterm success of BTC depends upon its ability to scale... It couldn't maintain $20K because the trading volume at that price practically crippled the network. It's difficult to imagine BTC breaking through that 20K barrier without widespread implementation of a scaling fix. The only solutions being offered are segwit and LN. The problem is that the lightning network only works when layered on top of segwit, and the market has basically rejected segwit (<10% adoption). Not to mention that LN is really only theoretical at this point. No one knows if it will even work large scale.



I personally see segwit/LN as a dead end for BTC.. and with a large percentage of BTC existing in small amounts that become untransactable with high fees, this sets a hard limit for the value of BTC (at around 20K, which we've already seen). 



I think the BTC community will eventually (within 2018) come to the conclusion that the only immediate solution is to increase blocksize... Which will require a hard fork... But then they'll realize that this has already happened.. It's called Bitcoin Cash. 



Slowly, key figures within the BTC community will soften their position on BCH, and BCH's value will climb (relative to Bitcoin). Eventually this will lead to parity between the two coins (my hunch is that this will occur at around the 4-7k range). 



At that time, everyone holding BTC will be forced to make a decision about which coin they want to go with...

Blockstream wants small blocks, high fees and slow confirmations to justify the need for their off-chain products, such as Liquid.

The best system? No. But most fast food transactions are on credit, which have their own fees for the vendor. Again, Bitcoin has EXPONENTIAL potential value. If McDonald's wants to accept it, I'm sure there will be a system in place that is beneficial to both vendor and consumer. 



I know you're part of the Ver army from a few weekends ago, so I don't exactly put much stock in a shill opinion. You think BCash is the future of crypto. You realize that when real Bitcoin was the price of BCash, we could send a transaction for a penny also? Your scaling solution is shit and nearly all developers say the same thing. You don't fix traffic congestion by giving your highway more lanes.



BUY REAL BITCOIN SHILL. We are open source and community driven. BCrashers are pushing this narrative that Bitcoin should be all about quick, cheap transfers of money. No. We evolved. Maybe one day Bitcoin will be that efficient system again, but right now people are storing thousands and millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on their own hardware devices and controlling their own destinies, and paying less than a DOLLAR to move their wealth wherever they want, whenever they want. You think I give a fuck that it may cost a DOLLAR to transfer wealth when I am sitting on a literal goldmine?!?! The community has currently decided that we'd rather have store of value that drastically outperforms any other investment than a way to pay for coffee. We have Litcoin for that. Which, by the way, is way better than your scamcoin pushed by explosives dealer Roger Ver.

The tether company gets rich cause essentially making money out of thin air with fake perceived value.  The whales get rich cause they were able to liquidate their holdings and can use the USDT for other purchases or trick other investors into buying the USDT from them for real fiat.  The exchanges get rich off the massive fees from the surge in volumes due to the crashing prices.



Epic scam IMO that will eventually bring a major crash across all crypto!

3511,"Bitcoin Cash is a scary investment. Just look how it was pumped and dumped. However, I know that Ver and his people aren't going to let it die, since we all know that he wants to supplant Bitcoin. That being said, Bitcore is simply a better coin with no marketing and no one like Roger Ver to market it. it's gone from $2 in September to $37 today. 



It was launched in April to little fanfare, but people are beginning to learn about it now. It never received the media attention that Bitcoin Cash did because it's a virtual fork of Bitcoin, which is different from the Bitcoin Cash fork. The community has been built the right way with organic growth and is getting bigger and stronger every day. 



Mark my words, Bitcore will be a top 20 coin by January, if not sooner. I can see it being a top 5 coin by June and in my opinion, it's going to challenge Bitcoin Cash for the #3 spot on Coin Market Cap. This is just the beginning. 



By the way, I'm just an investor in this coin, I'm not a paid marketer. Roger Ver has the entire community pumping Bitcoin Cash, but no one is talking about Bitcore, which destroys Bitcoin Cash in every category. Once the Koreans get on board the Bitcore rocketship, they'll be no stopping Bitcore. This isn't a sales pitch. These are facts mixed in with my personal thoughts.

My friends, it is time to see the bad things that Blockstream/Core has done to Bitcoin. They are responsible for these mess. BTC is unusable and unreliable, after paying $92 in fees, my transaction still stuck for days. Is this something that can be used as money? No, it has became worthless. Don't be deceived into thinking something worthless can be a store of value. If it cannot be transacted, nobody wants it and it has no value anymore.

The BTC mining algorithm (SHA256) is the same as the BCH mining algorithm which means that miners can switch from one to the other in minutes.



If I miner wants to switch from BTC to ETH, they have the throw away all their BTC mining hardware and buy ETH mining hardware because the ETH mining algorithm is different.

3662,"""This is a message from an insider. I am a member of Chinese whales community. I cannot provide any proofs nor open my identity but I cannot allow myself to stand and watch for the greatest theft from poor and reputation destruction of blockchain based cryptocurrency to happen.



I have been informed of major Bitcoin manipulation taking place in order to compromise Bitcoin security and reliability. A group of coordinated Chinese investors have a plan to pump Bitcoin to 10000 USD after which they plan on coordinated crash of Bitcoin to sub 1000 levels because they have already taken their fiat money out and replaced them with margin tether traiding. It will not cost them a dollar. They will push Bitcoin below the demand levels.



The situation with Bitfinex and Tethers is legitimate but it is a distraction. Inflated amount of Tethers are not a source of money used for Pump. Bitcoin  is the source.



For some reason community accepted 20 Billion dollar appearance out of thin air which is the market capitalization of Bitcoin Cash as the natural process. It is not natural. These artificial money are currently used to cash out Chinese investors and pump original Bitcoin to 10000 USD without taking any losses.



Shortly after Bitcoin crash below 1000 USD they plan to introduce Bitcoin Cash as a true Bitcoin and necessary replacament which is not inflated and then reject Tether pairings. This is why Bitcoin Cash price is stabilized at 1000 USD as was price of original Bitcoin in January 2017.



This is the operation Dragonslayer in it's final stage. They have created billion of dollars with Bitcoin hardforks and use Tether as a tool to artificially bump Bitcoin price cash out their money and coordinate total collapse.

These are the directions I received from devbitcoin on Reddit, who‚Äôs helped numerous people with the same issue on Reddit. I haven‚Äôt tried it just yet, but I‚Äôll let you know if it works.



You‚Äôre going to need a fully synced Litecoin-qt install for this to work, which may take 5-10 hours.



    Open up this page, BitAddress.org146, and LiteAddress.org76

    Copy your private key into the Wallet Details tab on BitAddress.org146. Scroll to the bottom and copy the ‚ÄúPrivate Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]):‚Äù value.

    Go to the LiteAddress.org76 page and move around your mouse until the Wallet Details tabs appears. Put in the hex key from the previous step in here.

    Select and copy the compressed WIF key (NOT the one starting with 6). Also keep note of the ‚ÄúLitecoin Address Compressed‚Äù from the first half of the page (starting with L)

    Open up Litecoin-qt, then head into the debug console.

    Run importprivkey ‚Äú‚Äù (with quotes).

    Once the import finished, run addwitnessaddress ‚Äú‚Äù.

    Wait for this import to finish as well. Take the M-address from the console and use this tool to convert it to a 3-Address.

    If the funds haven‚Äôt shown up yet, close Litecoin-qt.

    Restart Litecoin-qt along with a rescan. This varies by OS, and in most cases will happen automatically if you wait for 10 minutes or so before restarting.

Damn, I think they're using both segwit and multisig through a so-called P2SH-P2WSH construct, which isn't supported by BCH and may not even be recoverable currently! :(



Log into block.io and hover your mouse over the Litecoin address - if it says ""Litecoin Address (SegWit)"", you're in trouble.



You can read more about the problem and the btc.com service that solves it for ""regular"" segwit addresses (i.e. P2SH-P2WPKH), here: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6z56x3/attention_benevolent_bch_miners_a_bch/



I'll have to do more research to find out if it's even possible to recover BCH from block.io's kind of addresses, but in case all of the above applies to you and we still find a way to do it, these will be the first steps of the recovery:



Recover your private key from block.io, i.e. you'll need to click the ""Settings"" link/button in block.io, then ""Access Private Keys"", then follow the instructions that were sent to you by mail and recover the keys for the LTC address you sent your BCH to.



You'll end up with something that looks somewhat like this:



        Address: 3Qb...

        Address Type: P2WSH-over-P2SH

        Required Signatures: 2

        Redeem Script: 2 ... ... 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG

        Redeem Script Hex: ...

        Public Keys: [""..."", ""...""]

        Private Keys: [""..."", ""...""]

        Complete. Handle with secrecy. Do not share. Do not store insecurely.



Warning: Whatever you do, don't post this anywhere public - not even the public keys/redeemscript!

Someday you're going to have to make ""Bitcoin Cash Cash"" or something to increase it more. The solution, Segwit, brings BTC transactions down to about $1 right now. Sure, higher than BCH, but BCH has 200kb blocks now because nobody uses it. And under stress test BCH doesn't hold up as well as Segwit. Lightning isn't even that complicated to people who work in cryptography or who are developers. And unlike BCH, I can use LN to send instantly, and not even have to wait for a single confirmation. 



We didn't want to make a new coin, that was the issue. It's a soft fork that's backwards compatible. What's closer to his vision, literally THE Bitcoin as released? Or one with a change? LN rides On top of BTC as a layer 2 payment system, while BCH (even if it wasn't centralized in China)  and BTC itsself didn't change. You can use an old BTC client as released and make transactions on BTC, while BCH is not even compatible. 



And bow that Segwit is popular and the mempools are nearly empty (past few days) and that LN is being released with instant transactions (I bought a router through Ln mainnet and it cost me 3 satoshis, flat, plus the initial $0.65 to open the channel since the mempools has been empty for a few days with segwit)



Lightning Network is infinately scaleable, BCH is not. Sure, it can handle 4 times the transactions, but it's not doing any.

People who bash on BCH don't do it because they don't think BCH was better, we did it because BCH pretended to be BTC, and tricked people, forked the coin, and now refuses to make any scaleable solutions. The only thing on the roadmap is 8, 16, 32mb blocks. They will keep forking it as needed, creating more and more coins. And on top of that, it's miner-centric, and nobody actually uses it. No merchant accepts it. 





And BCH wants to make their own version of LN without Segwit now? Why? ""We don't want to change anything at all about it... Except for adding lightning and change block size but not segwit because that's all BTC propaganda"".



Since technically, the first BTC client released can still send BTC to someone else on BTC mainnet, and not BCH, that means we are the real bitcoin, and while it's by definition exactly the whitepaper, it doesn't matter. So fucking what? If aviation followed the Wright Brothers vision, we'd still be using wing warping and flat airfoils, and while their vision was brilliant for the time, we would never have jetliners and stuff today.

Well so can Bitcoin, it's just that we don't because it's not secure.

Heh it's secure on BCH cause who the fuck would want to use BCH? Nobody even uses it for transactions, people send money between their own wallets.

4278,"> 2nd layer solutions are essential to relieve block pressure whatever size it will get to be.



But don't the 2nd second layer solutions involve centralization too, with an astronomical number of ""lighning clients"" and only a few PayPal like full nodes? Ultimately, the scenario after few years is going to be that there will be *some* full nodes who can afford the storage and computing power, and *some* partial nodes who can't afford that. In the lightning scenario, the partial nodes will be called something else (perhaps lightning clients).



Considering that 2nd layer solutions involves more coding and added complexity (which means more bugs) along with centralization, I think staying with the simpler solution is better if it achieves the same purpose, isn't it?



The only way to have both decentralization and full nodes for everyone in the long term is to keep shredding/archiving/compressing the blockchain every 5 years or so that one can start from scratch (personally I think this is the best and simple solution from design perspective).",18-01-21-02-34,1,0,[deleted],7rr12v,4278,0.019,0.15,0.831,0.9728

The problem imho are connection speeds that may not keep up with the amount of transaction data... imagine a node witch has to download X GB of data every 10 minutes... we cannot be sure connections will always outpace transaction data being produced in a 1st layer only scenario.

In 2011, Ver was already an entrepreneur and self-made multi-millionaire from his company. When he learned about Bitcoin, he sold his company and invested it into Bitcoin and Bitcoin startups. Then he worked full-time since then to promote Bitcoin. Not as many people as today, but many people in 2011 heard about Bitcoin, because Ver heard about it on a radio show. However, nobody else quit their job or sold their companies, to invest everything, including their time, into Bitcoin.



Many of the biggest Bitcoin companies were created with help from Ver.  He took huge risks by investing in Bitcoin companies in 2011. Bitpay is the biggest Bitcoin payment processor.  Blockchain dot info is the biggest provider of wallets.  Kraken is one of the biggest exchanges.  Bitcoin dot com promoted Bitcoin non-stop, even now, it is still promoting Bitcoin.  Even Venture Capital firms were not willing to invest in Bitcoin startups until recently.  Without these companies, which were promoting, servicing and accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin would not have grown as big as it did.



Since 2011, Roger has been all over the media to pump up BTC.  You should be grateful to Roger Ver if you made money on BTC.



When you heard about Bitcoin, did you quit your job or sell your company, invest everything into Bitcoin and work full-time on Bitcoin? If not, why not?  WTF have you contributed to Bitcoin?



You implied that Bitcoin is NOT a ""turd"" now.  So, it should be easier for you than it was for Roger in 2011.  Why haven't invested everything you have into BTC and BTC companies?  So why aren't you on the Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC and other media outlets pumping BTC?

Here‚Äôs the thing. If we think about this logically BTC may be pumping but less and less people are actually using it as a currency. It‚Äôs use as a currency is how it‚Äôs gained is status as a store of value. 



Every good store of value has a 2nd use case.  Gold:  you used to be able to transact with it but you can also make jewelry.    A home:  it‚Äôs a store of value, but you can also live in it. 



Small transactions have become impossible with BTC because of the fees, and actually more and more businesses are saying that they accepted BTC but stopped doing it because no one was using it (don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is coming from a HUGE bitcoin believer). 



So if people are using it less and less to transact, It would seem like it would start to become less and less an attractive store of value.

He has lost value regardless of whether you calculate the loss in terms of his BCH total, his BTC equivalent total, or his USD equivalent total.  



He's mining at a loss in the first place, since BCH is less profitable.  Even if he was a firm believer in BCH, he could have had a much larger BCH balance had he been mining bitcoin, then converting into BCH.  So his BCH balance is lower than it could have been.  Loss #1.



In terms of relative Bitcoin balance, he could have held more if he was converting his BCH to Bitcoin since the fork.  Loss #2.



In terms of relative USD balance, he could have held more if he was converting his BCH to Bitcoin *or* USD since the fork.  Loss #3.



Basically, out of every possible strategy, he earned the least amount of money possible, no matter how you denominate it.



The fact that he's holding it all shows me that it was never meant to be profitable though.  My guess is still that it's Bitmain.  They have planned on losing this money from the start, as a way to ""fire core"" or something.  They're trying to prop up the price by reducing available supply.

4432,"I get your position and totally agree that transaction volume is important from a certain perspective.  But Bitcoin has always been slower, more expensive for the user, and less convenient than credit cards.  This has never really changed.



Luckily the use-case of Bitcoin that matters most is monetary sovereignty and resistance to censorship and central control.



This makes Bitcoin the world's most independent and unbiased **arbiter** despite its sub-par payment system qualities.  We have thousands of huge payment systems out there.  But how many independent and decentralized currencies do we have?  How many trustworthy, independent, uncorrupt arbiters do we have?  How about global, open, censorship resistant networks?  Don't forget the forest because your stuck looking at just one tree.



Bitcoin is worth $T for that reason alone, and using it as the ultimate arbiter, we can build decentralized and trustless payment networks on top of it that will put every credit card company to shame.



The idea is not to forget what makes it valuable.  Hope BCH stays around, but I respectfully think you are focusing on the wrong thing.

4445,"My example for ""loss #1"" has absolutely nothing to do with trading.  I'm simply talking about acquiring the most BCH with the mining power he has.  In that example, he could have more BCH by mining BTC.  By mining BCH directly, he's losing out on additional BCH.



In the other examples, I'm not talking about trading ""in and out"" of anything.  I'm talking about picking a single denomination and holding your earnings in that denomination.



Of the options, BCH, Bitcoin, and USD, he is choosing BCH, which earned him the smallest balance of the three.



Maybe it'll work out for them long term, but I personally don't think so.  BCH has been steadily dropping during the latest crypto bull run.  There are no miners, it's operating at like 8% of Bitcoin's difficulty, and any large Bitcoin miner (having 10% or more) can 51% attack it whenever they want.  The single ""unknown"" miner *coughBitmaincough*, can 51% attack it right now because it represents over 75% of the hashpower on the chain.  Did I mention the EDA fiasco?  I can write an entire post on that alone.



But forget about mining power.  There are no users.  Blocks are routinely 10kb or smaller.  The majority of the entire supply (~16 million) is held by people who don't even know it exists.  It additionally has no ability to do layer 2 scaling.

4450,"> How many people do you think are using it as an arbiter?



Everyone holding it is using it as an arbiter.  They are trusting the contract of their savings and investments under the Bitcoin stamp of security.  The entire darknet runs on multisig contracts.  Almost all the exchanges now use payments channels and aggregation to manage their customer's capital.  These are all rudimentary smart contracts, similar to an on/off switch, or an if/then piece of code.  They accomplish one thing, but by stringing them together and stacking them you can create incredibly complex exchanges, payment systems, or contractual relationships.



I can see why it looks like price justification at first glance, but try to step back and look at *why* this entire market is blowing up.  Is it just because of gains, or is it because people are looking for security in the face of a mountain of uncertainty and fear?  The American and European cultures are falling apart, and most of the entire modern world is drowning under insurmountable debts.  Countries are seceding, currencies are dropping left and right, and everything is so interconnected that its spreading.  Gold doesn't hedge against it anymore, there are no banks not intertwined in it, there is no political independence anywhere.  But Bitcoin moves without a care in the world against other commodities, it is truly a new asset class.  It is a new technology that has the potential of fixing all of this with a new foundation, and it continues to show that it has *horrifically stubborn resistance to change or attempts to control it.*



I think that is why Bitcoin's price is high.  The world is insanely out of balance and seemingly *everything* in the financial system has become so interdependent that there seems to be no way to protect your money.  But Bitcoin creates a tiny hole in that balloon and the air is starting to rush out.

Also I was one who was promoting Bitcoin in the cents to dollars range. Two things we always said was don't put in more than you can afford to lose and Bitcoin is an experiment.



For your own situation you never lose until you sell. Bitcoin probably hasn't peaked yet. With the split between BTC and BCH price progress has slowed until things become more clear. My advice is buy small amounts regularly, consistently, like every day or week. That way volatility never affects you,   but in the long term, year after year you're likely to be up because Bitcoin is deflationary. Last I think BCH is far undervalued now, so I'd diversify and put an emphasis on BCH. It's still waaay early in the cryptocurrency game.

Right now as I see it, buying one or the other is taking any money I have available and putting into something that I can‚Äôt use throughout the day.

Roger wants the world to use BCH because BCH is ready for the world. Economic freedom, like that with which comes with BCH, allows for growth and wealth in places where economic freedom doesn't currently exist.

Censorship of the community led to more and more misinformation about what was possible spread. The idea of side chains came about with no one left to say otherwise. Anyone who wasn‚Äôt for the Blockstream vision was forcibly removed, or silenced. And Bitcoin, as you know it today, was born. 





Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, was created in order to retain the vision of scaling on chain, as seen in the white paper. Created by those voices that were snubbed out during the years leading up to the segwit deviation.

4828,"**Streisand effect**



The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

What happened with Coinbase doesn't even classify as ""insider trading"" per any law anywhere. It's a fake/planted news story.



If you want to scream ""insider trading"" go to stock market and trade those markets. This is *crypto*.



---------------



Here is more information on why regulating insider trading might be a bad move:



https://youtu.be/luzYxFIcDmU



It shows why regulations put in place to ""protect against insider trading"" are done so to game the system. Regulation is bad in this case, just like almost every other case where the government interferes too much. It inhibits the free market.

This wasn't a pump and dump (because [BCH](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=USDT-BCC) is still holding steady at around 3400), and everyone who follows this sub and /r/btc knew the Coinbase adoption was coming. The timing was a little suspicious, but the actual ATH for BCH didn't hit until 8:30AM this morning (at least on Bittrex), so people that were watching could have sold then and still made off. 



Plus you yourself almost definitely made a profit by selling your BCH, especially while the other coins are low. And on top of that, you're doing so in response to information regarding Ver's character, which is inside info to a reasonable extent that the majority of people would be mostly unaware. 



So I don't really care about Ver. He's smart, but certainly flawed. You could say that about any of us, but since he's a frontrunner in the race he's getting a shitton of flak for making money off something that he's passionate about. So I guess the question:



Why is his profitability so criminal, but yours or mine isn't?

5076,"Let me just take a moment to talk about the rational behind insider trading laws. Now, securities trading is just like any other transaction, so lets consider transactions in general? I think a good criteria for fraud in any transaction is thus: don't outright lie and don't omit anything that would cause a reasonable person to strongly believe in some falsehood. You don't necessarily have to disclose every single detail if there is no reason for the other to reasonably believe to the contrary, unless of course there is some reasonable expectation that you are in fact obligated to disclose everything. If they ask specifics you can't lie however.



Now, turning attention to the securities market, for people running a public company there is a reasonable expectation (fiduciary duty) by current and prospective shareholders (the general public) that they will disclose everything relevant to a transaction before making it. Thus any market activity by them without full disclosure should be fraud and is. Now, if one in charge of a privately owned company gains some market knowledge in the course of business and uses that to influence their trades of other companies I don't see any problem there. There is no reason for them to be mandated to disclose their knowledge prior to their transactions as nothing is implied otherwise and there is no duty by them to disclose to anyone in particular.



However, under current law the latter would still be illegal. If a private company shorts a competitor before they unveil a major innovation or buy stock of a partner before announcing a business deal, that would be considered insider trading. That's ludicrous, anywhere else similar things are accepted, as in real estate. For example, when buying land you don't need to disclose your potential use of it, whether it be oil drilling or building an expensive structure, even if that would make it more valuable pre-sale. Similarly if one buys stock from someone else they shouldn't have to disclose that they have a major deal in the works with them.",17-12-21-10-23,1,0,[deleted],7l5by9,5076,0.057,0.069,0.874,0.3294

Everything Hitler did in Germany was 100% legal, all of it. Did that make all of it morally right?



To take a currency trading example, Forex trading. 



It's not possible to characterize or prosecute a Forex operation as insider trading, due to the fact that insider trading involves profiting from trading securities, and currencies are not considered securities per se.



Cryptocurrencies do have something in common with stock that fiat currencies don't, but it is in no way criminal to do insider trading of cryptocurrencies. Because Cryptocurrencies aren't securities, and they're not covered by laws that regulate securities. 



Your argument then becomes that insider trading is immoral? That's your opinion. Either way, it's not a crime. 



And to further point out some facts, if there was insider trading, it was a few employees of Coinbase at worst, and Coinbase have already said they'd investigate to see if they violated company policy (which is the sum total of the ""crime"" if they did). 



So I don't know why you're here bashing BCH and Roger Ver for insider trading done by some other company, after he spoke the truth and said that insider trading of cryptocurrencies isn't a crime. 



Would you really be this worked up about it if were insider trading of BTC also? Or could it be that you have a massive axe to grind against BCH and Roger Ver?

However, I can't bring myself to think that people with inside information will not use it manipulate the market. The people inside would need to report accurate information and somehow do it within a timeframe that won't drive the markets to shit (I honestly think the timing of the information is just as important as spreading it).



So what happens when someone on the inside  was trusted for years decides to switch to the competitors so he/she reports inaccurate information, half truths, half lies, or times the release of the information to bring the company down? Or better yet, what about someone who wants the company to succeed but wants the price to be a little lower so they can have a friend buy in and report half lies to bring the price down just a little and report crazy good news to spike it back up?



Mind you, this is just a very simple version of manipulation and I'm sure it can get far more complicated than this, which is why I don't see how making it legal could work.

I agree with you there. There are more advanced techs out there.  But after a certain point there are diminishing returns in increasing the efficiency of the tech when the current tech already provides more than enough slack for the current use cases. BCH already has adoption and widespread use that is increasing exponentially.



> Lastly I think BCH will struggle to scale, you cant just keep increasing block size.



All cryptocurrencies will need to face the issue of scaling. It remains to be seen whether or not increasing block sizes indefinitely will be a viable solution. So far, tests indicate that block sizes can successfully be increased up to 1GB. This level of scaling is enough to exceed Visa levels of global use. Additionally, it's argued that by the time we reach that level of mass adoption (a few decades most likely), network infrastructure and computer hardware technology would have evolved to allow indefinitely increasing the blocksizes as a viable solution to scaling. 



Another important factor regarding the scaling issue is that the development for BCH is decentralised and comprises of multiple development teams, so the solution to scaling can change in the future based on consensus.

That said, the market is still developing and quite clearly is chaotic. Most coins and networks are speculative at best. I‚Äôve hedged bets on things I like, and as this space grows and changes I‚Äôll be willing to adapt. I certainly adapted with ETH and BCH once they proved their stake. BCH and ETH seem to offer better solutions and usability in comparison to most others out there, especially BTC. I‚Äôm positioned in some alts that I feel are promising and will follow them. For 2018 BCH feels like a safe bet on the board is all. Might not catch 10x gains, but likely won‚Äôt shutter up or see the entire community supporting it walk away simply because the charts go red.

This is an old post, but that's incorrect.  You don't have to trust the 3rd party nodes at all.  That's the beauty of it.  If the nodes disappears completely, the funds return to the sender after the expiration period.  That's one of the very basic fundamentals of its design.

5293,"because in the tiny brief moments where buying has been allowed, the price has skyrocketed. After the announcement on Tuesday, the price of BCH skyrocketed to $9500 on Coinbase. And that was not a glitch, multiple people actually paid for BCH at that price. 



Second indicator was earlier today (Wednesday) at 5pm EST. Right before Roger Ver was on air, people were allowed to buy BCH. I tested it out, it would have let me buy if I hit confirm, it didn't say ""buying BCH temporarily disabled"". And during that brief 15-20 minute period (if that) the price of BCH went from around $3700 to $4600. In a matter of mere minutes. 



Once the public is able to buy this from coinbase unrestricted, the price will absolutely skyrocket. I would be surprised if we don't see $9k within a day, and tbh I kind of think that's why they delayed it. They know the demand is so great that if they allow unfettered buying it could disturb the entire crypto market as we know it. Better to delay and let the price increase 2 or 3 x over the course of a couple days rather than a couple hours. You might not be super happy with Roger or the ppl at Coinbase, but they aren't stupid. The price will rise so dramatically that the idea of bitcoin losing dominance will not seem improbable. 



That being said, if people are only interested in USD and get weak hands, you might see a lot of seller around the $6k or $7k mark for BCCASH. Do not fall for their dirty tricks! If you HOLD the price will naturally increase to $9k minimum if not upwards of 15 or even 20k. BCASH may not be the most amazing coin in the world, but it is undeniably better for sending and receiving money than bitcoin is. 



CNBC is shilling it, as are other news agencies. The inability to buy imposed by GDAX has created a pent up demand among normies who have no other way to buy BitcoinCash. Just search #bitcoincash on twitter and see for yourself. 



Trust me, hold on this one. I mean sure, if you set a sell target go ahead and sell. But don't you dare sell this coin without making some nice cheddar for yourself. Doing so would be practically sinful",17-12-21-18-15,7,0,[deleted],7l7vqd,5293,0.095,0.099,0.806,0.575

The fact is that BTC has a much larger adoption currently than any other crypto. There are ATMs enabling you to get BTC all over the world. BTC is legal tender in Japan. It is supported by all exchanges. BCH has a long way to go and that is what BCH supporters must be working on to build a future for it.



80% controlled by Chinese companies? You probably refer to the hashing/mining power (https://blockchain.info/pools)? Well, the concentration of mining for BCH is similar or worse (https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek). Also, in terms of ownership of coins and distribution of nodes that secure the protocol, BTC is currently safer than BCH.



Last: you compare BTC to a red dwarf. Poor choice. Red dwarfs are the most common type of stars, and they have a very very veeeery long life, like trillions of years (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf). You probably meant to use a blue giant.

1. We no longer use Netscape, but we do use browers. We no longer use Myspace, but we do use social media. We no longer use analog film development techniques, but we do take photographs (and at a higher rate than any time in history). So why is your point on obsolescence framed to make Bitcoin the contingent technology and not the fundamental technology, when you said yourself it is the original cryptocurrency?





2. The F-22 is better than the F-35. Which is used by the USAF? 





Putting aside USDT/$, the overwhelming base currency for BCH is BTC. The value of BCH is measured in satoshis. And satoshis are units of Bitcoin. So,

I'm not really defending BCC as much as I am putting down BTC. 



You're right, hype is important, and the Bitcoin name is extremely valuable. But which Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin will be determined by its value as a functioning currency and that is what will drive adaptation. BTC has ATMs because it was the first. How long will it take you to transfer funds with those ATMs right now? I've never used one but if transferring BTC using an ATM is just as slow as it is online then those ATMs are useless. Cryptocurrency was not created because it can be used on an ATM. We already have regular currency for that. Cryptocurrency was created for online transactions and right now BCC is the Bitcoin that is the most efficient at that.



Look at the charts you posted regarding hashing power. For BCC, 36% of hashing power is in ‚Äúother‚Äù and only 30% is in China. The fact of the matter is that China has a monopoly when it comes to the hashing power of BTC and that is unlikely to change. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by node distribution regarding the safety of the cryptocurrency. BCC is a new cryptocurrency; BTC had a rough start with security and is not perfect either. But I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm not very familiar with the technical aspects.

5366,"**Red dwarf**



A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star on the main sequence, of either K or M spectral type. Red dwarfs range in mass from a low of 0.075 to about 0.50 solar mass and have a surface temperature of less than 4,000 K.



Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one is visible to the naked eye. Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun, is a red dwarf (Type M5, apparent magnitude 11.05), as are fifty of the sixty nearest stars.

I agree that BTC is important as a intermediary when swapping alt coins but this feature will eventually be made obsolete on exchanges.

It is the driving force which keeps this whole crypto thing moving forward. 



The hostile takeover attempt by Roger Ver and cronies was not only a self serving pump and dump scheme but also a threat to the entire ecosystem, bitcoin cash included. Imagine the headlines if BTC were dethroned by an imitation, dare I say knock off of itself. Potential investors would shy away out of confusion and new money would flood out of the market from fear. 



Let bch be the alt coin that it is and let BTC do its thing as the frontman.

Red supergiants are stars with a supergiant luminosity class (Yerkes class I) of spectral type K or M.

I think the major reason why BTC hit $8000 is because people were dumping BCC; the BTC value is hyper inflated. When Coinbase implements BCC, the BTC value may go up for a while but will inevitably drop into equilibrium with BCC. From this point on the currency that is the most practical will dominate.

5473,"because banks actually DO provide a useful service to society by taking deposits and doing credits to help finance businesses that need some capital to expand or start.



The problem of banking is not that they do what they do (even fractional reserve to be honest), it is that they are FORCED upon us by legal tender laws. If you want to start a fractional reserve scheme, I am happy that you are free to do it as long as : you inform anyone of your true reserves and I am not forced to participate into it. Which is exactly what CSW is saying.



Central banks have so much power because they can devaluate thee currency while hiding their true reserves and force the public to use their currency by legal tender laws imposed by government force.



if you force them to be transparent and they can't use force, they are not going to cease to exist, but any government that wants to print money for war will have to do transparently, and the public will not allow that because now they have the power to make a different choice (having their own bitcoin in their own wallet).



But if you promise me +10% per year in btc for a fractional reserve banking deposit, I may still want to put some of my money into it. Some may think it is a ponzi scheme, maybe it is, but it is only mine to decide.

5622,"Elliott made detailed stock market predictions based on unique characteristics he discovered in the wave patterns. An impulsive wave, which goes with the main trend, always shows five waves in its pattern. On a smaller scale, within each of the impulsive waves, five waves can again be found. In this smaller pattern, the same pattern repeats itself ad infinitum. These ever-smaller patterns are labeled as different wave degrees in the Elliott Wave Principle. Only much later were fractals recognized by scientists.



In the financial markets we know that ""every action creates an equal and opposite reaction"" as a price movement up or down must be followed by a contrary movement. Price action is divided into trends and corrections or sideways movements. Trends show the main direction of prices while corrections move against the trend. Elliott labeled these ""impulsive"" and ""corrective"" waves.



One of the most common question I am asked. ‚ÄúHow do I know where to begin counting waves using Elliott Wave Theory.‚ÄùIt is a good question and much like one would put a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle together is how you can begin counting with Elliott Wave.



I count waves by looking for recognizable patterns and pieces that seem to fit in or near that pattern. These patterns can be determined by seeing which elements fit the requirements for an elliot wave and do not break any o the rules. In order to be able to do this accurate, you must study Elliot waves as well as the rules behind them. 



The Impulse Wave is the kind of wave that I have been using so far to illustrate how the structure of Elliott Wave is put together. It is the most common motive wave and the easiest to spot in a market. Like all motive waves, it consists of 5 sub-waves; three of them are also motive waves, and two are corrective waves. This is labeled as a 5-3-5-3-5 structure, which I've shown a lot on here. However, it has three rules that define its formation. These rules are unbreakable. If one of these rules is violated, then the structure is not an impulse wave and one would need to re-label the suspected impulse wave.



The three rules are:



1. Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.

2. Wave 3 can never be the shortest of waves 1, 3, and 5.

3. Wave 4 can never overlap Wave 1.",17-11-29-08-04,5,0,[deleted],7g7gle,5622,0.013,0.056,0.931,0.9325

It's clear to me that no one in the BCH community wanted to destroy BTC.   They wanted to compete against banks and needed specific features to do that, and BTC simply did not want to cooperate with their proposed solutions.  So they decided to create their own currency and pursue the goal of competing against banks without interference of BTC.   Since BTC has a similar end goal, BTC and BCH are competitors.  



Amazon did not go into business to destroy Walmart, or to destroy Macy's.   Amazon went into business to sell products to consumers over the Internet.   Walmart and Macy's compete for the same customers, so Amazon competes because it has to compete to win.



Likewise, BCH project was not started to destroy BTC.  It was started to find a solution to replace banks and provide lower cost transactions.   The BCH and BTC people could not agree on how to accomplish their common goals, so they decided to compete.

Note two misconceptions on splitting. 



1. Edge can only split funds if it received money before the fork or if the sending wallet sent both BCH and BSV into Edge. Exchanges are likely to only send out one of the coins. Also, if your wallet received some pure BCH before sending to Edge, that would taint the wallet and likely cause it to only send BCH to Edge. 



2. After splitting, only funds that are already in the Edge are replay protected. New incoming transactions that have both BCH and BSV are not replay protected. As long as you have some split funds in Edge, you can replay protect future incoming funds by spending your full balance back to yourself from Edge to Edge.

Moving those inputs to one address will make it so you only have to extract one private key instead of multiple.""

A hard fork is simply the way you use to add new features to the coin. The value of the BCH will go with the new fork, and the old BCH will no longer exist or be mined.



Some people may try to keep the old one alive for whatever reason, but that won't be BCH anymore. BCH hard forking isn't contentious - everyone is on board with that the coin is making changes.

meanwhile as the bankers totter forward , two well-funded trojan horse operatives  have postioned themselves to gain commit access:  Pieter [œÄ] W in jan-2011 and and Greg Œº in feb-2012.

the greek Œ≤ = beta is used typically in regression analysis to help us understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (fees e.g.}  changes when some of the independent variables ( block weight e.g.) are varied, while the most critical variables ( narrative, blksize and consensus-veto  protocol e.g.) are held fixed.



the greek Œ≥ = gamma for Garzik is the symbolic camel bending down to enter the archway with a height of 2 meg, when the push comes to the shove as happened in oct-2017. Then in early nov-2017, the archway of 2 meg proved too difficult and dangerous to negotiate even with the maximum bend possible so that all attempts to enter had to be abandoned.... 



the greek œÄ = pi for Piieter, denotes mastery of circuituous  logic which gives a semblance of certainty [314]



the greek Œº = mu for Maxwell G, denotes the micro measurement that would stand 100 times bigger than the humble sat.

5857,"Dwelving deeper on bitcoin on the programming side I found out that you don't ""register"" addresses on the blockchain before transactions if you will, and they only start existing on the blockchain when they receive or you send a transaction. Let me quote https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address



>Creating addresses can be done without an Internet connection and does not require any contact or registration with the Bitcoin network. It is possible to create large batches of addresses offline using freely available software tools. Generating batches of addresses is useful in several scenarios, such as e-commerce websites where a unique pre-generated address is dispensed to each customer who chooses a ""pay with Bitcoin"" option. Newer ""HD wallets"" can generate a ""seed"" token which can be used to allow untrusted systems (such as webservers) to generate an unlimited number of addresses without the ability to spend the bitcoins received. 



The address gets ""realized"" either by a transaction being pushed to the network taking an unspent output on your address, a script and signing it with the private key of your address, or someone realizes your address by simply pushing a transaction to it. This creates a 0 requirement of storing any wallet information on your server (companies do this themselves for controlling users transactions and to snitch to the feds in order to stay in operation)



So the blockchain becomes your database and you get incoming transactions by wif stored on your computer -> your private key -> querying the transactions of the address of your private key on blockchain.info / blocktrail.info using a javascript HTTP library then you use the information of your unspent outputs to push transactions to the blockchain (via the same API)",17-12-28-02-48,1,0,[deleted],7mfr7c,5857,0.017,0.048,0.934,0.8231

In doing so has created an even bigger divide within the crypto community. We should all be united in this community because the real divide is between us and the regulators, thats the good fight.

Crypto hedge fund manager, Michael Novogratz, said that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin. 



We have to be honest and admit that it is bitcoin - and not bitcoin cash - which is known among the people. People and especially rich people will want to invest in bitcoin and turn towards investment mangers (institutional investors). However these guys will more likely invest in Bitcoin, in order to keep the promise to the client, that they are investing in Bitcoin, which is the crypto-currency that the client knows about and wants to invest in. Why? Because of possible lawsuits, if the manager does a mistake (loses money) by investing in another currency than Bitcoin, without telling the client. And we know from Adam White, that trading volume is caused by institutional investors; not by ""regular"" mortals. Meaning that the masses consisting of regular mortals, like myself, have very low influence on the evolution of the price.

Also I think a lot of news about big investors comes to us through the media and thus the message is dumbed down for the uninitiated ie I think when they mention investing in Bitcoin they are referring to crypto's in general. A diverse portfolio makes more sense.

Ultimately as they say the market will decide and with a little research I think the faster, cheaper to use and atm cheaper to own a full one BCH will be more appealing.

I agree that people should put more effort in spreading BCH, so it can have a stable future. Digital Darwinsim is good term describing it. I think that BCH is a better payment method for the regular user. But people need to be aware this.  



I also read this on why SegWit is not a sustainable solution for BTC: https://bitcrust.org/blog-incentive-shift-segwit

Increasing from 1MB to 8MB was therefore a better solution. (under the condition that it is not a fraud of Ver.)



The other thing is - IMO - that BCH needs to become much more popular before the mainstream institutional investors pore in. As the founder of Omniex, Hu Liang, said: ""the market hasn't reached its velocity escape yet.""

The point of BTG was to stick it to the ASIC miners that secure Bitcoin.



The point of BTD is to instantly achieve a bigger market cap than Bitcoin Cash, since BTD increases its number of coins by a factor of ten.

Even if it only achieves a price of a few hundred, it will still have a greater market cap.



Like BTG, it will attract speculators and a FOMO crowd, there will no doubt be wallets to scam people, it will be difficult for the normal person to dump, keeping its price overvalued for a while, causing confusion on the market.



This is all intentional, to show ""airdrops are bad"" and to point fingers to get them struck off the listings.



Most importantly, they will include Bitcoin Cash in such calls.

This is because when more than ~1MB of transactions are sent to the network, only 1MB can be written per block. This makes a backlog, or waiting list for all the other transactions.



BCH block size cap is large enough that its virtually impossible for you to have to wait in line.



So on a day with not much activity, BTC can be ""as fast"" as BCH, even with a smaller block. But when lots of activity happens again, there will once again be a long waiting list of transactions. Back in dec 2017, that waiting list was about 300MB. That means if everyone stopped, it would take 3,000 minutes (50 hours) for the BTC chain to catch up.

Then you can do bayesian analysis of how well this rule is enforced, on BCH it is near 100% at this time.



You can query most of the hashpower nodes to make sure the transaction is known by the majority of the hashpower. You can also verify they don't have a double spend transaction.



You can even broadcast the transaction for your client yourself, he just signs it, send it to you offline (NFC for example) and you broadcast it for him. Added advantage : your clients don't need an internet access to pay, only you the merchant does.



You can also setup an insurance company that externalizes this very low risk for a fixed fee on all transactions and it will be profitable.



Of course all of this is for ""low"" value transactions (less than $10'000 on BCH). Otherwise you wait for some confirmations.



You can also create more complex systems to make 0conf secure for all amounts if you lock up some money (like twice the amount) in a smart contract that you can only redeem after the transaction is settled and if you try to double spend you will lose the locked up money.

There is essentially one line in the code that says ""max_block_size = 1MB"".

It's kind of like a speed limit sign that says ""speed limit 1km/h"". Your car might be able to go 100km/h, but you obey the speed limit sign.

6083,"If you imagine every transaction as a signed cheque that has:

- Cheque number xxx

- Pay from xxx

- Pay to xxx

- Signature xxx



Segwit basically turns that into:

- Cheque number xxx

- Pay from xxx

- Pay to xxx



Then a separate piece of paper with:

- Signature xxx

- See cheque number xxx



This means a few things:

Signatures aren't seen by old bitcoin software.

Signatures can be stored ""outside"" of a ""block"" in an ""extended block"".

Signatures can be deleted.

Each segwit transaction is actually larger in bytes than a non-segwit transaction.



Segwit ""increases"" the capacity of BTC by a small amount because the signatures aren't put into the ""block"". That signature data is in an ""extended block"".



Each segwit transaction is slightly larger in bytes than a normal transaction, because it has some extra information like ""see cheque number xxx"" on the signature note.



Some were strongly against segwit because it's fundamentally different than all historical bitcoin transactions, since it's a cheque with some sticky note with a signature attached to it. The security is reduced in some sense, because any old bitcoin software doesn't even see the signatures.



Regarding BCH transaction confirmation compared to BTC confirmation:

The probability of a BCH transaction being included in the next block is very high. It's not absolute certainty, but high probability.



That means if I were to pay you $1 for a coffee with BCH, there is a very high probability that it will be included in the next block in about 10 minutes.

That probability is about the same for BTC on some days, but much much lower on other days, depending on the day. It's not as predictable.



BCH ""instant"" transactions are ""good enough"" security for cheap stuff - and large values in certain cases. If I sold a car to an anonymous person with BCH, I would want to wait at least 10 minutes for a block, but probably a few blocks before I hand them the keys and let them drive away.



If I sold a house to someone with BCH, I wouldn't have to wait, because if they do a ""double spend attack"" and I don't get paid, I just knock on the door with the police since I have proof I was not paid.



So sure, a ""0-conf"" or ""instant"" BCH transaction isn't perfect security, but neither is walking down the street perfectly safe. Nor standing in line at a coffee shop. Someone could hit you on the head with a baseball bat. But most people aren't complete jerks, so it isn't really something you worry about.

6161,"In that article the Author, Robert Kuttner, asks, *""Remind me, what is the problem for which Bitcoin is a supposed solution?*



**Mr. Kuttner, with bitcoin you can:**  

  

**Transact Value**  

  

* send money to anyone (peer-to-peer) anywhere in the world in minutes

* send micro-payments 

* optimize transactions 

* eliminate middlemen 

* eliminate billions in bank fees and transaction costs 

* eliminate bank delays and speed business

* eliminate bank limits 

* eliminate charge-backs 

* eliminate paperwork 

* transact anonymously or with permanent public documentation in the blockchain 

* save billions in less-efficient third-party fees 

* bank the unbanked in poor countries 

* use a more durable, portable and divisible form of currency  

  

**Store Value** 

  

* avoid debasing (Venezuela, Zimbabwe‚Ä¶) 

* control your money 

* lessen the FED and banks‚Äô control over your money 

* access and use your money 24/7 

* make money  

  

**Cryptocurrency does two things particular well - it transacts value and stores it.** It‚Äôs both a medium of exchange and store of value ‚Äì simultaneously. Cash and gold aren‚Äôt. Cash is predominantly a medium of exchange while gold is predominantly a store of value. You can trade cash for a Laszlo pizza easily, but cash depreciates if you hold it. Gold appreciates if you hold it, but you can‚Äôt swap it for a pizza easily. Bitcoin is both cash and gold, made liquid, digitally. This is one of the remarkable and revolutionary properties of bitcoin. Some try to understand it by comparing it to cash or gold, when it‚Äôs not entirely either, because it‚Äôs both, simultaneously.  

  

**Once,** for example, I bought a car in Mumbai. To do this, I had to transfer money from my bank in the U.S. to the Toyota dealer‚Äôs bank in India. It took six weeks. And numerous international phone calls to find the money and push it through. My bank claimed they sent it, the dealer‚Äôs bank claimed they didn‚Äôt have it, and it had to be routed through a fourth party New York bank for some reason. Why does it take this long? Why, when an ATM in India can tell you your bank balance in the U.S. in under 30 seconds? If the Toyota dealer accepted bitcoin, we could have concluded that transaction with our phones, without middlemen, while standing in the parking lot, in a few minutes, for a few dollars.  

  

**Thus,** bitcoin is valuable because it‚Äôs useful. And it's useful because it does things - better.

Xapo ""institutionally"" sold ALL of their BCH, all at once, and it dropped BCH from 1,500 to 1,250.  



Two factors come to play.  Coinbase has a lot more BCH.  But, it is held by individual investors.  I read on a lot of the other subs that many BTC folks are nervous about the high price of BTC and are asking if they should take some profits and move to alts.  If BCH is stable and climbing, a lot of people will hold it.



The hardcore BTC fanatics will sell and that will cause some downward pressure.



Actually, I just thought of a third factor: the Xapo sale was all at once.  Coinbase sales would be spread out as some sell, some wait to sell later, and some don't sell at all.



If, before January, BTC has a correction and BCH is still in range or climbing, it may be a very mild selloff.



BCH is gaining in popularity and reputation as people are using it.  A lot of people used it to trade for alts while Eth was down in the Kitty attack.

What is CryptoKitties?



CryptoKitties is a game centered around breedable, collectible, and oh-so-adorable creatures we call CryptoKitties! Each cat is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.



**Fucking genius now that I read more about it:**



What‚Äôs the big deal about CryptoKitties?



CryptoKitties is one of the world‚Äôs first games to be built on blockchain technology‚Äîthe same breakthrough that makes things like Bitcoin and Ethereum possible. Bitcoin and ether are cryptocurrencies but CryptoKitties are cryptocollectibles. You can buy, sell, or trade your CryptoKitty like it was a traditional collectible, secure in the knowledge that blockchain will track ownership securely.



But, unlike traditional collectibles, you can breed two CryptoKitties to create a brand-new, genetically unique offspring. It results in something special‚Äîjust like you!



Woah, slow down Mr. Scientist ‚Äì describe CryptoKitties in words that make sense to me



Think breedable Beanie Babies.



So they‚Äôre digital toys that are D.T.F.?



A toy built with emerging technology, the groundbreaking concept of digital scarcity, and a genetic algorithm, but sure‚Äîlet‚Äôs summarize them with a crude acronym.



Does it cost money to play CryptoKitties?



Unless you are an early access user (they get a free CryptoKitty), yes.



How do I get a CryptoKitty?



Go to the ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù and look at the CryptoKitties for sale, or breed two CryptoKitties together.



How do I sell or breed CryptoKitties?



Your CryptoKitty‚Äôs profile page has two buttons below it‚Äôs name for selling or breeding it.



How much does it cost to buy a CryptoKitty?



There‚Äôs no standard price for CryptoKitties. Users set their own starting price when they sell their Kitty, and the price goes down until the auction ends or the Kitty is purchased by another user.



The CryptoKitties team releases a new ‚ÄúGen 0‚Äù CryptoKitty every fifteen minutes (up until November 2018). The starting price of ‚ÄúGen 0‚Äù CryptoKitties is determined by the average price of the last five CryptoKitties that were sold, plus 50%.



Note that you need to use ether to purchase CryptoKitties.



Can‚Äôt you just create new CryptoKitties?



Not exactly. Blockchain technology prevents us from tampering with the ecosystem we built, which protects your CryptoKitty from artificial inflation or the digital collectible equivalent of insider trading.



Once all the ""Gen 0"" CryptoKitties are gone, there‚Äôs no way for us to add more.",17-12-08-17-11,2,0,[deleted],7id2gt,6196,0.036,0.093,0.871,0.9732

The beginning was all about proving that Bitcoin worked, and that it was solid. It didn't matter what you were buying, as long as you could use bitcoins to buy it.



As far as LN, while I do find aspects of it exciting, the fact that you'd eventually have to pay a fixed monthly fee to open up a payment channel if it were massively adopted leads me to believe that only banks would be able to use Bitcoin as some sort of settlement layer to move large amounts of currency around. This keeps banks relevant but, most importantly, shuts out the common man from using Bitcoin as a payment platform, where its true innovation lies. 



What I would find interesting is if BTC successfully scaled layer 1, like we've seen thus far with ETH which handles twice the amount of transactions than BTC for less than a cent, then implemented LN, not as a scaling solution, but as a feature set that would allow for atomic swaps among other things.",17-11-26-09-39,3,0,[deleted],7fikqc,6249,0.05,0.136,0.814,0.9599

Security/attack vectors ... complexity.   It was just not designed for the use case of p2p money.



There isn't any reason to move away from the bitcoin design to outcompete 'Visa'   The inability to scale is FUD, and zero-conf transactions work for 'p2p money' now that RBF has been removed.



Yes. For more serious transaction sizes, then the block confirmation time may be an issue - although that's not impossible to change.  Missing features (eg. privacy) can be added.



>it already handles far more transactions that BTC at a fraction of the cost.



The reason for this is BTC is crippled.   If you compare with a non-limited block version of bitcion, the transaction fees are the same.



... but bitcoin (with non-limited blocks) is working to bring back FREE (or at least immeasurably small fees) transactions.   ie. like peer-to-peer money.    Eth won't have this (and it shouldn't be their intention to) due to the intended complexity of their transactions.

""Bitcoin's price"" at the time of the fork was around $3k. The BTC side of the fork mostly maintained this price while the BCH price has never recovered.



The only logical arguments are 



(a) BCH is a new crypto that mimics ""Bitcoin"", and has tripled or so since it was created; or



(b) BCH is the real ""Bitcoin"", but has lost half its value since BTC forked off.



The BCH community needs to pick one of these interpretations and live up to it.

Jumped from 3100 to 4800 in a matter of minutes.   But then gdax and coinbase cancelled all orders.   Price immediately went down to 2900.   I bought at 3300 so when i saw 4800, i was in la la land.   



That being said, while the surge was going on, bitcoin dropped as low as 14k.  Litecoin was at 298ish.  I dont ever notice ether..but i assume it dipped as well.   



Then once the price dropped instantly back to 2900ish, bitcoin and litecoin jumped up again.   



This leaves me to believe all of these pending orders that got cancelled affected the prices that much.  All the ppl trying to trade BTC for BCC got cancelled.   So...just imagine when coinbase gets their shit together and those trades happen.  Also new money will be bought from lots of coinbase users.

Additionally, there is no such thing as ""SegWit BTC"", that is another mnemonic device meant to intentionally muddy the waters in the public mind about the singular identity of Bitcoin. 



The ""confusion"" arises entirely from Bitcoin Cash proponents intentionally conflating the two for marketing reasons. It is a disinfo campaign.



Bitcoin Cash does not originate from the genesis block, Bitcoin Cash cloned the legacy blockchain and now claims it for itself, but the reality is Bitcoin Cash came into existence in August 2017, and did not exist before that. BTC is compatible with the legacy chain and the one and only Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is just any other altcoin that was created by forking off Bitcoin, like Litecoin.

No, you are just illiterate. You are idiotically referring to Bitcoin by the name of a reference implementation (Bitcoin Core) instead of the actual name of the cryptocurrency, which is Bitcoin. You are attempting to extrapolate a falsehood by twisting my words, so let me reiterate to prevent your willful misinterpretation:



Bitcoin is Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin Core"" is software, a reference client. You opt to call Bitcoin by the name of that reference implementation (as well as calling it ""SegWit BTC"", a made-up term) because you want people to believe there are multiple, competing ""versions"" of Bitcoin, with Bitcoin Cash being one of them. But that is false, and you are lying. There is only one Bitcoin. I am not confusing anything. Again, any confusion about what Bitcoin is comes solely from the tiny, toxic cabal of BCH proponents who, since the creation of Bitcoin Cash on August 1st, 2017, deploy gaslighting and misinformation to market BCH as Bitcoin. Your disingenuous little spiel is just a derivative of that scheme.

6533,"> Bitcoin is Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin Core"" is software,



This is exactly what I am saying, that the Bitcoin Core software is practically the only implementation running the Bitcoin BTC network. 



Bitcoin Core and the bitcoin network are practically indistinguishable. The other implementations of Bitcoin that rally behind Bitcoin Cash are notably different. Given that there are many Bitcoin BCH implementations (not a single reference client) it is not practical to call bitcoin BCH Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin ABC. 



>Bitcoin by the name of that reference implementation (as well as calling it ""SegWit BTC""



Actually, Bitcoin Segwit is an apt description. Bitcoin, as described in the whitepaper Section 2, refers to a coin as a chain of signatures, Bitcoin Segwit is bitcoin, so is Bitcoin pre segwit. But Bitcoin pre segwit is dead as that version of bitcoin is no longer defined as a coin when using the definition provided in the bitcoin whitepaper.  



I'm afraid this conversation may have to stop if you cant refrain from using words like ""toxic cabal"" and ""You are idiotically referring to"" and accusing me of lying.

Ok, so you admit you are not calling Bitcoin by its name. Thank you. Please do the same with ""Bitcoin Core"", the name of the cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.



The whitepaper is irrelevant, outmoded and not a standard to be met. If you want to be a fundamentalist, have at it while the rest of the world evolves without you. Consensus rules here. Bitcoin is still Bitcoin despite your protestations.



Your appeals to confused masses are disingenuous too. If you actually cared about people being confused, you'd simply call Bitcoin 'Bitcoin' and Bitcoin Cash 'Bitcoin Cash' like the overwhelming majority does. That would end all confusion.

Bitcoin was designed with the assumption that everyone is greedy, the only constant in this world. 



A single miner, who may have the potential to undermine the entire blockchain and take transactions for themselves is absolutely a possibility but very unlikely to be a reality because as soon as they do it they undermine their own revenue stream.



If a miner were to ""steal"" BTC from a wallet it would be a public transaction and thus would destabilize the blockchains and value very quickly.

If you own SHA256 ASICs, you mine *both* BCH and BTC *simultaneously* (i.e. some machines pointed at BCH and others at BTC).



Here is the proof (from an old comment of mine):



The share of hash-power going to BCH can be determined as follows (in short, it is slightly less than the price of BCHBTC after accounting for BTC mining fees)



Mining reward (coinbase + fees) per unit of time = Reward per hash * hashes per unit of time.



Miners wish to maximize their reward per hash - full stop.



In order to maximize their reward per hash, miners will proportionally split their hash power and simultaneously mine both BCH and BTC. They will split their hash power in order to satisfy the following set of equations:



(1) Reward per hash mining BCH = Reward per hash mining BTC



(2) Hash rate toward BCH + Hash rate toward BTC = Total available hash rate



Note: Equation 1 above is key because because if they were not equal then a miner would decrease mining the less profitable coin for the more profitable one.

No it isn't. There are ways to counter that. It will cause damage, but as long as there will be minority of non-colluding miners there'll be low motivation to attempt a 51% attack. If such an attack succeeded, BCH could fork to a new PoW algo, and even roll back the chain, and it won't be an apocalypse, only temporary damage.

Why would they attack BCH and not BTC? What if they believe BCH has better potential for them?

6598,"The ELI5 is: it is too expensive to attack BCH. To attack BCH means to not make money mining BTC.





The not ELI5, yet still only partially complete, answer is below (this analysis is missing a discussion of the long-term consequences of ""killing"" BCH - but rest assured miners are happy to mine both BTC and BCH, after-all it was [miners who enacted the BCH hard-fork](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/regarding-bitcoin-cash-viabtc-bitcoin-abc/)):



The machines used to mine BTC and BCH have high opportunity costs (i.e. if they are not mining for the block reward they have to make *more* money from double-spending attacks than they could have earned mining).



To conduct a [51% attack on BCH at the moment](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) requires just over 1 exahashes per second. This is 5% of the BTC hash-power (1 exahashes / 18 exahashes).



In the last 24 hours, BTC mining rewards totaled [$30 million dollars](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/). That is roughly $200,000 per block, or $200,000 every 10 minutes ($30 million divided by 144).



So for your 5% hash-power your *expected* cost is $10,000 every 10 minutes ($200,000 times 5%).



Thus, you would have to double spend more than $10,000 every 10 minutes for your attack to be *profitable.*



It is hard to double spend that much money so fast, and still stay ahead of honest miners and nodes. I elaborate below, but the short answer is no one will accept 1-confirmation for $10,000 they will wait for more confirmations which only increases your costs as an attacker.



The difficulty and cost of successfully conducting a double spending attack are outlined in [Section 11 (page 6) of the bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/bitcoin.pdf).



The math gets messy, but my summary is: the probability an attacker can catch up to the honest after being even just one block behind when attempting to create a false chain is low, and the probability drops fast as the attacker falls further behind.

The problem is still the *[flaw of averages](http://flawofaverages.com/)*. Reality has statistical fluctuations, if you fall behind by one block, you can't do the attack.

6820,"**Poisson distribution**



In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution (French pronunciation [pwaÀàs…îÃÉ]; in English often rendered ), named after French mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.



For instance, an individual keeping track of the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution.

If prices then drop to $1000, and you buy 5 more, you will have paid a total of $12500 for 10 coins, which makes 12500 divided by 10 coins. Each coin will have cost you 1250 now, instead of 1500, so you can now sell at 1300 with a profit (where otherwise you would have needed over 1500)...

Sudden spikes usually have equally sudden profit taking drops, exaggerated by panic sells along the way, but sometimes it simply stays at a high point after a spike. I've seen some weird charts on coinmarketcap. 



Just sitting it out will be less stressful, no need to check every other minute (although I do like that actually), but I do agree with you. Accumulating during downfalls along the way up will make the profits way bigger of course.

Honestly, tweeting is rather mindless.

Far too many people put too much stock into what is broadcast over social media. I use the time to flit in randomly as a means of having a break and clearing my mind from some of the things that I am working on. As crazy as it may seem to some, moving from mathematical theory and law into something as pithy as Twitter can be refreshing.



Found this part interesting.  The pithy-ness of twitter was always a turn off for me.  While twitter can be very pithy as well, I feel there is more opportunity for deeper (longer) comments and posts.

""The system is entirely decentralized, without any server or trusted

parties.  The network infrastructure can support a full range of escrow

transactions and contracts, but for now the focus is on the basics of

money and transactions""



Satoshi didn't restrict Bitcoin to the whitepaper, so why do you? Notice he says ""money and transactions"" is only the focus ""for now."" If you closeread the whitepaper to define Bitcoin, you contradict Satoshi's larger vision. 



So, given that, your use of the whitepaper to disqualify Bitcoin and promote BCH is nonsensical. You're selling Bitcoin short just to fit it to your description of Bitcoin Cash. And all this is still without saying that no one is forced to interpret Bitcoin like this anyway. It's not a religion. You keep your misplaced fundamentalist nonsense, I'll stick with consensus. Since consensus is not on your side, I can understand you taking that position. But you need to realize it's a minority position, a unilateral position, and an attack on Bitcoin.

7080,"It's meaningless because it's based off of the total quantity of tradable coins. In reality, a very small fraction of this total is actually traded (the circulating supply). So an inflow or outflow of a quantity of coins that is small relative to the total supply but large relative to the circulating supply drastically changes the price of the currency because only the coins in the circulating supply define the price. The same could happen if there became a decrease or increase in demand for the coin. These changes in price are reflected on the total quantity of coins and thus the market cap. As a result market cap is drastically changed by fluctuations in the market.



To use an example, if 90% of your currency's coins are held by people that do not want to sell them, then people who want to buy the currency must buy from the remaining 10% that are up for sale. This smaller supply inflates the price of the coin on the market. However, the market cap is calculated as the price x the total 100% of coins. But there is no way that there is enough demand to buy 100% of those coins at that same price if they were all up for sale.



This is the source of the use of dumping to depress a currency's value. Only a small amount of the total currency is needed to flood the market with an abundance of a currency and dropping the price a lot.



What's worth paying attention to is how much of a currency is actively being used instead of held. Be wary of currencies with significant quantities of coins consolidated in the hands of a few (see rich lists).

Bitcoin does nothing to stop central banking at all. A fully Keynesian bank can be set to run a purely bitcoin economy. I'm about as far from being a Keynesian as anyone could be, but at the same time I will tell you that bitcoin does nothing to stop a Keynesian monetary policy. A central bank basing its holdings completely on bitcoin is possible to be imagined. The only real difference with this system from what we have now is honesty. The government can take out loans in the same manner that they do today, and they can inflate the currency in the same manner that they do today but the difference is that the results of their actions will be immediately seen and not hidden for a time when it is politically expedient in the future and when it is other people's problems. A Central bank based on bitcoin has the benefit of not being able to be secretly debased'' - CSW

Naysayers that didn't listen really can't say much now. The proof is undeniable. I'm strictly here sharing knowledge and helping people within the crypto community make money. No need for negative comments guys. If you don't want to make money that's fine, but I get tons of messages from nice people here asking me for updates. 



Another coin I've been doing awesome with is LINK. There is so much more potential for LINK guys. 



LINK will be the next top gainer of Binance. Stoch is very low and we are almost done consolidating. This is a very safe trade so I recommend filling a nice bag. Load up under 7800 sats. 



Target 1 is ATH at 12000, with a second target around 18800, which is the 1.62 extension and also happens to be based on the depth of the bowl. Nice bullish divergence on the 1D SRSI as well.

They *should* wonder this. They are correct to wonder. If they do their research of the history of Bitcoin, they will find their answer.



> If you answer me with scaling, block times, and/or algorithm rebuttle(s), I would like to once again remind you that I need you to think in terms of ""the average person"".



A while from now, someone will use a blockchain technology or some app based off of ""Bitcoin"". They won't care what coin *exactly* it is behind it, just that it works and is ""secure"", whatever that means. Maybe blockchains are so common at this point that the user doesn't even bother to care or look up if it uses blockchain, they just maybe know it uses internet. The user experience will be so separate from the technology behind it that if you ask the user if they use blockchain, they will say no. 



So the answer is, that the ""average person"" doesn't have to know the difference. The enthusiasts and early adopters should though, because you can do more with Bitcoin Cash than BTC. And everyone in the cryptocurrency space right now is still *basically* an enthusiast (sorry to say, precisely not average)! It's more common than it used to be but still only a fraction of people have any cryptocurrency.

7397,"Monero is probably the least scammy cryptocoin.



They actively discourage hype, don't market themselves, and are putting lots of effort into basic fundamental research into economics, security, privacy and usability with help from academic researchers.



They have no connection to Bitcoin Core.  Their codebase came from Cryptonite which was inspired by Bitcoin but was developed completely independently.



There was no large pre-mine like with some other coins.



Monero automatically scales its block size, so never suffered from Core's small block delusions.  BCH doesn't even do that yet.



Only downsides to Monero I am aware of are that:



1. The privacy techniques result in larger transaction data, so the blockchain requires more storage per transaction.  But they are working on that, and you get something for it: actual privacy not the leaky Bitcoin kind.



2. The API is harder to implement than for most other coins, so support from wallets and exchanges has been slower to develop.



3. Because it is not as popular for transactions yet, and the greater memory requirements, fees are relatively high (but nowhere near Bitcoin Core level).  However, as numbers of transactions go up, block sizes and their fee totals go up, but individual transaction fees go down.

BTC did not deserve it's previous run up. BCH doesn't deserve to be at $2400.

Fees remained low as people traded. Cashening might not be this year, but something is going to happen again... and again... as each time people will get fed up of the high fees and slow confirmations of BTC unless they pick a legitimate way to scale that works for everyone.

* Low-power devices can't afford the energy requirements of mining two transactions for one transaction to be transmitted

* The centralized coordinator server that seems will be required for a long time.

* The wallet expects you to generate an 80 character seed yourself. Or to use some script from the power shell or python script but where the seed can be hacked. Apparently there were wallets hacked and funds stolen because of this.

Ver is absolutely right when he says we need to stick to the original bitcoin white paper. Here is the first sentence in the white paper:

7882,"Groupthink behaviour seems to be incentivized by the reddit karma system. If you post something that you believe the group wont like, then you lose karma; or you could say: you get bad karma. Conversely, you are rewarded with an increase in karma if you post something the group likes (you get good karma). I'm not saying the reddit karma system is good or bad. I just think that's one side effect of it.



An interesting thing to consider is how much power the voting system gives to the centralised maintainers of the reddit system. If those centralised maintainers wanted to influence the behaviour of people they could artificially adjust the votes to reward people who are speaking in a way that is favourable to them and punish people who speaking in a way they don't like.



If I was a central planner who wanted to manipulate the opinions of people I might consider buying up reddit and manipulating votes to influence behaviour in my favour.

FYI.

There will be some small number of nodes who do not update. They will be orphaned until they update. Like the last hard-fork I expect no issues.

No. Phased increases in block size are meant to keep everyone happy.

If Craig Wright (Fake Satoshi) is the public face of BCH, then BCH has no chance of becoming the #1 cryptocurrency. 



This will go down as the biggest marketing & branding mistake in the crypto world.

- https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/dwr1fwv/ 



Any benefit from adoption & tech - bigger blocks, Bitpay integrations, CoinText.io projects, potential Purse.io support - will all be destroyed. 



As long as CSW is on stage, it's going to end up being ""the cryptocurrency world against Fake Satoshi's BCH"". 



**From a marketing & branding perspective, this is a fatal mistake that will burn down the BCH house**.



For example, [Vitalik Buterin has been consistently on the side of Bitcoin Cash](https://www.yours.org/content/3c637b53d926/#comment-9eaf227d59c3).  



But even he is [publicly calling CSW a fraud](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/03/vitalik-buterin-calls-craig-wright-fraud).  



A fire needs to be put out early.



The Real Satoshi operated anonymously, and was able to create Bitcoin, birth the cryptocurrency universe, and change the world with a whitepaper we all read.



The fact that CSW thinks he must run around publicly on stage to make a difference is just another piece of evidence that he is not Satoshi, but rather a fraudster.



For the sake of BCH, CSW needs to get off the stage, and go into the lab.



btw, I recommend watching Rick Falkvinge's recent video:

Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin, the chain starts jan 3, 2009, and is the same for Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), from the genesis block and up to 1.aug 2017, when the split occurred. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is arguably the bitcoin version which is closest to the original bitcoin (which stopped to exist with the inclusion of segwit in the BTC chain). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the high capacity, low fee, instant payment version, the only coin with a vision to conquer the world.



Bitcoin cash is non government, free market, sound money for the world, easily transactable, relatively anonymous, hideable, protectable, backupable and teleportable.

My point for moving towards the X prefix is it holds significance by international standards for being associated with a stateless currency or asset. In another words, a currency not associated with any recognized government uses the X prefix or the ZZ prefix for unknown territory. At the moment, the BT prefix for BTC being used by Blockstream belongs to Bhutan and I don't see that changing in our lifetime.

Roger is the biggest bitcoin evangelist of all time.

He created BCH to change the world for the better, not to ""Pump and dump"" and get more coins. Roger wants to shift power away from corrupt governments and prevent wars, not pocket more coin. He has more coins & money than he would ever need, that's why he donates tons of them!

The first source is just a debate between Roger and the Host, Richard, where they AGREE that bigger blocks are an awesome solution to the scaling problem of BTC. In the debate they agree that Roger didn't pump anything. The only thing even remotely close that the host mentions about Roger ""screwing"" people is when he says that  Bitcoin Cash is stealing hashrate from Bitcoin. **Here's a thought:** in a system that's supposed to be trustless it shouldn't be possible to ""steal"" anything. Bitcoin should be resilient to such attacks or it should fail.Ôªø Hashrate belongs to the miners, you moron. That's not stealing or ""shitcoin pump & dumps"".



The second link is to bitcointalk, the administrator of that website is Michael Marquardt, more commonly known as u/theymos. He is a cuck and also the ringleader of the /r/bitcoin circle jerk. He also recently came into scrutiny for potential mishandling of $1 million of entrusted forum donations, censorship of Bitcoin forums and websites that he moderates, an alternate client, and blanket banning posts. The only one screwing people here is that cuck u/theymos. Furthermore, this is a SUPER biased forum, but if you actually took the time to read it, I think the best quote is this one:



> I don`t think that Roger is a person who is looking for opportunities to pump-dump Bitcoin to make some more money. He seems to be doing well so far. I believe he is truly fighting for future of Bitcoin. Whether we aggre with him or not, It would be illogical deny that fact. He is an important figure among Bitcoin users and his strong opinions makes small movements in the market. I personally believe that time will prove him right.

**Read the white paper you fucking, cuck.** Satoshi described exactly what bitcoin was: ""A chain of digital signatures"" Satoshi also said that bitcoin should never hit a scaling ceiling, and that the ultimate solution is to let the blocks get as big as they need to be. The only ones screwing people are Blockstream! They're the ones that turned BTC into a shitcoin by changing the roadmap and making it so that bitcoin doesn't need to be a chain of signatures.

1. Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V365_59-Lc . So Bitcoin Cash has most rights to the Bitcoin name.



2. Bcash is simply stupid, and born out of fear from the BTC Core side. They don't have any problem (yet) with for instance Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond etc. so it's not about avoiding user confusion, it's about knowing deep inside that Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the original Bitcoin, putting the heads in the sand and just blindly attack and censor anything BCH related out of some combination of denial, fear, uncertainty and maybe even a bit jealousy of the more free and can-do mentality of the BCH community. 

Bcash obviously wasn't made up as some nice gesture to help out with a catchy name. It has the B in it so clearly has the annotation of not being the A, so it's a derogatory term.

If that population grows from new exchanges and new meme pushes and new news articles and so on to something like .0001% of the population, meaning millions instead of hundreds of thousands, then your coin will go up ten x in value, because of the order of magnitude shift. 



Looked at another way, less than  1% of people are using this coin. If adoption reaches even the level of 5%, this coin will be worth easily 5-10X more than it is right now.

The SV code removes the limit on the number of opcodes per transaction (among other things), which makes it a hard fork. All someone needs to do is publish a transaction with 201 opcodes in it to SV miners. They will include it into a block, which ABC, BU, and XT will mark as invalid and ignore. If SV has enough hashrate to keep that branch longer than the ABC+UL+XT branch of the fork, then SV's hashrate will stay there and their chain will be longer, but anybody using ABC, BU, or XT will not see their chain. The only ones who will see this SV-specific chain will be users and businesses who are running Bitcoin SV. This will likely include exchanges, who will list the coins reported by Bitcoin SV as BSV.

if u've already used  electron-cash for bch and ledger nano-s  for bch or eth then allow yourself at least an hour to apply this fix which hooks up the ledger and electron-cash wallets.



If you're totally new to electron-cash & ledger than allow a full-on crypto-weekend to learn the special ropes needed for detecting  1-sats on the nano.



set up your bch wallet to operate on the split chain. install bitcoin cash wallet 1.1.8 from the chrome browser and launch it..



click both ledger buttons together on the bitcoin cash window to open your bch wallet in ledger, check that browser-support = no on the device...toggle between ""use wallet to view"" and ""settings"" then dual-click on settings



then install electroncash.org as follows



check u have the latest version here https://github.com/fyookball/keys-n-hashes/tree/master/sigs-and-sums ... [don't know how to do this]



file / new-restore / standard / add hardware wallet / next / next



the native electron wallet is called default-wallet, when the ledger connects the second wallet on electron it will be called wallet-1 or wallet-2



after the first connection, installing electron subsequently will remember wallet-1 or 2 and take u directly there where u can see the ledger addresses



when u send from ledger u will see the tx show up in electron way before ledger picks it up, so u must not disconnect electron until your funds go through via 6 confirmations



TIPS FOR ESTABLISHING THE CONNECTION



everytime u hit an error on electroncash.org reboot, open the bch wallet with the code even though your timeout period maybe 10 mins



try a different usb slot or a different cable



if new/restore takes u straight into wallet-1 or 2 and u can see your ledger main address called ""my account"" inside electron, then the connection is ok, even though u get no confirmation message and even though u cant see you additional ledger adresses..



if u get the ""install wizard"" dialog when u click new/restore , then click choose to see what wallets u have got if u see that wallet-1 and wallet-2 have both been created then delete both and start again



if u get the ""install wizard"" dialog when u click new/restore check and u see either the wallet-1 or wallet-2 screen, then check that u are seeing your ledger address [my account] on wallet-1 or 2



TIPS FOR HELPING TX SUCCEED



u can only connect to 1 ledger account at a time.

to simply matters use only myaccount until we can figure out an easy way to swap between accounts.

do not send/receive on the ledger app, rather use electron to send/receive.

check that the amount of bch on the bottom left hand side of the electron screen is equal to the amount in  ledger's myaccount minus a small fee.  



if u have more than 1 account and u reset app data...via settings on chrome browser support, click on tools/ reset application data. Next time u go into ledger your bch balance will look like zero.

but when u reconnect with electroncash, the funds in your main account will show up first and then several hours later the funds in your additional accounts should also be recovered.

Say however, I want to buy a car/house/other asset in BTC or BCH - or transfer large amounts from one place to another - I would prefer BTC as it is more decentralised and less susceptible to price manipulation from miners gaming the DAA.



I think Lightning network will increase adoption and make BTC more decentralised as more people will be incentivized to run nodes.



Also, increasing the block size only allows linear growth, but we need exponential growth. Increasing the block size also means smaller players can no longer run nodes, thus decreasing the security of the system as a whole.

8517,"Ahh, the age old debate



Big blocks would only have linear growth if no further innovation was planned (at least, linear with the current slope).  Currently, the big-blockers are looking into pruning of the block-chain (removal of spent outputs) as they are useless besides for archival purposes.  This would mean the blockchain would only have to store everyone's current balance (unspent outputs).  Additionally, Bitcoin currently uses only a single thread in it's current implementation.  We plan on properly implementing multi-threading, which will massively help.  Also, a note on bandwidth requirements:  Even using 1 GB blocks, which would allow 3,000 TPS, a network connection of only 24mbps would be necessary, and this is only if fuzzyblocks were not implemented.  With the addition of fuzzyblocks, the bandwidth needed to sustain 1GB blocks would be between 12MBPS and 24MBPS.  Ultimately, yes, scaling will be linear, but there is much work that can be done to massively change the slope of that line.



Also, a note on the decentralization of full nodes:  I have 3 points to make here.



1) Bitcoin's security model is based on no entity's ability to acquire %51 of  the hashing power.  This means that decentralization of full nodes is rather unimportant, only decentralization of hashing power so no entity could seize the hashing power.  A powerful entity could spin up 100,000 malicious full nodes, but without %51 hashing power, those malicious full nodes couldn't cause many problems (Please correct me if I am wrong) since transaction validation is based on hashing power alone.



2) As more and more people use Bitcoin, more money will be in it, and more nodes will appear.  By more nodes, I mean more meaningful nodes, nodes that have hashing power behind them. 



3) The more bitcoin scales, the more people use it.  The more people use it, the more normalized it is.  The more normalized it is, the more difficult it is for governments to step in and pawn it off as a tool for crooks and attempt to put it in a negative light.  Scaling now gives us this powerful edge.  If people, that very day, bought coffee, gas, and groceries with bitcoin, they will hear the establishment try to bad mouth bitcoin as a currency only used for drugs and terrorism and laugh.



A quick note on the DAA:  We needed a different difficulty algorithm because if we didn't have a different one, BCH would have either been screwed whenever minors left BCH for BTC, or BCH would have been exploited by tons of minors leaving BTC for BCH, thus average block times getting very short.  Since hashing power changes dramatically for BCH in these early days, we needed something that adjusts faster.  Fortunately we have a better algorithm than we did when we first hard-forked in August, which has helped both parties (I believe).



As far as I am aware, the scaling issue comes down to people's opinions on the issues we've laid out here in this thread. BCH believes the network will be fine with big blocks after we perform these innovations and that lightning will be centralized (there is an argument that it could end up being centralized, that's a debate on it's own), adhere to KYC laws (anti-privacy), and feasible to censor.  BTC believes that big blocks will cause so much full node concentration such that it will become feasible to censor and that lightning will be easy enough to use and truly decentralized.



P.S., see this article.  If you've seen it before, have you seen a refutation?  I'd be curious to see one.

Core/Blockstream had no problem with Bitmain when they signed the Hong Kong Agreement in order to prevent Bitcoin Classic from becoming the miner node of choice and raising the blocksize once 75% of hashpower signalled for it.



If anything, Bitmain gets tons of promotion from them since they're made out to be the only manufacturers of Bitcoin mining ASICs out there. They're not. Bitfury, for example, uses their own ASICs. But they're not sold on the open market like Bitmain's are.



Furthermore, $$$$ *is* the goal of miners. That's why they're mining. They're not doing it out of goodwill. That's the whole idea of Bitcoin. A trustless, decentralized system.

What I don't like about the BCH community is I can say anything a want pos/neg about btc, but seems like a mass troll attack if anything negative of bitcoincash or bcash (my favorite term) is suggested.



The OP definitely was taking a stab at Bcash but are we really so weak minded to have to fight in every forum. If bitcoin cash can serve a purpose let it serve the purpose. Fighting against bitcoin users/believers is a waste of time. A fork happened. Bitcoin Cash is not ""bitcoin"". It is ""bitcoin cash""...something that chose to not stay with consensus. Be proud of that and make the old/new fork the best it can be. Fix all of the problems btc has/had and keep it moving.



I suggest fixing malleability, anonymity, and the rest of the roadmap that was considered good prior to the fork. I hope that development isn't just waiting on improvements from Core & Blockstream to then take like parasites. Code better! Show the BCH dev team and community to be better coders who add more value than ""Core"" and the community will grow, right? Free Market competition? Best coders, best ideas, largest network, wins on its own merits. 



I know a lot in the community don't like bitcash or bcash, but I do. Just like I like Dash, stands on its own merits and makes a clear break as a fork of bitcoin codebase. I'm a crypto anarchist at heart (like Satoshi) so I think I will call it whatever the hell I want for clarity. There is only one BTC and forks of it: bitcoin Gold/super/diamond/cash/etc, why fight for a stupid title among many. BCH loses a wonderful market position opportunity.

If I had $10K and invested it in Bitcoin Cash on Aug 1st when the hard-fork was, using the $210.385 low, I would have 47.5 BCH. Right now, that would be worth $75522.15 @ $1589.94 per BCH.



If I had $10K and invested it in Bitcoin Core on Aug 1st when the hard-fork was, using the $2668.59 low, I would have 3.68 BTC. Right now, that would be worth $63934.48 @ $17373.50 per BTC.



So that's -$11587.67 for investing in BTC since the hard-fork. Also, I can spend my BCH for fractions of a penny within a few minutes. What can Bitcoin Core do? Let me guess, it's just a ""store of value"".

8687,"This image is correct.  Don't listen to people who say this is FUD or an attack on core, this is a legitimate image demonstrating concepts often used in enterprise-grade networking.  

  

Couple things to note when looking at this image:  



1. The funnel width is the *throughput* - how much data can go through at once.  

1. The funnel depth is the *latency* - how long it takes to get from A to B.  

1. It takes the same amount of time for data to go through each funnel, assuming there is no congestion.  

1. If data enters the funnel faster than it can be released (exceeding throughput) then it begins to queue (back up).  

  

This is the same mechanism that explains why you can download a file at 100Mb/sec but you may still ping the server you're downloading it from at 500ms.  The 100Mb/sec is the throughput, but the 500ms is the latency.  That pipe might be backed up, but you still have data in it.  So while you can get data at a certain rate, it may not be real-time due to the latency.  

  

On point #4, this is why it can take a long time to confirm transactions in Bitcoin (or any coin really).  If there is enough data in the mempool then the funnel width is fully congested and queuing must occur.

This is nonsense. Scaling was an issue from day one.

Nonsense. You could make 45,000 gig blocks and it would still be an issue.



***You're not thinking ahead at all***.



If you want the entire Earth's population to buy everything with your coin, AND you want micro transactions, AND you want to decentralize the internet (like Steemit is trying to do), you're going to need something insane like 8,000,000,000,000,000 bit blocks.

No, it wasn't. It was temporarily not increased (not ""intentionally crippled"") to work on better solutions to raising block size.



The market liked the decision, too - the price didn't drop immediately following the fork.

By mid-2018, BCH will be fully implemented by the likes of Bitpay, Coinbase, Blockchain wallet, etc.  By end of 2018, the most common crypto currency used to buy coffee will be BCH.



> why is it still dropping in marketcap more than other coins?



Because the daytrading market is different than the retail market.



You track the daytrading market, which is full of irrational HODL & lambo memes.



I track retail node adoption, and median transaction fees.



> You need 2nd layer solutions dude.



No, you need low transaction fees. NOW.  No excuses.  Imagine you had two credit cards in front of you.  One offers 2% cashback.  The other has a $10 transaction fee.  Time to go shopping. Which one are you going to use?  Are you going to use the 2nd one, because they claim that one day their lightning project will get rid of their high tx fees?  Doubt it.



btw, off-chain systems - like lightning - are a scam, which will steal your money via old channel states.  Lightning is also fatally flawed (like you can't send 1 BTC to someone who doesn't already have 1 BTC).  Only idiots will use it.  Plus..



**On**-chain systems - like BCH & LTC - will compete against each other.  It's P2P, where person ""a"" can send $1 to person ""b"", and nobody can subjectively block or intercept that money.



**Off**-chain systems - like lightning, Visa, Mastercard - will compete against each other.  Visa offers 2% cashback, acceptance & terminals everywhere, and incredible reliability (in the last 25 years, 100% of my Visa/MC transactions went through quickly).  Even if Lightning pulls off a miracle, and fixes all their structural flaws, nobody will use it unless they offer 5% cashback for several years.



Off-chain systems are a scam, an illusion.  The cash flows are not much different than using a Visa/MC.. you do a bunch of small transactions off-chain, and then once in a while you break off part of your BTC from the blockchain to pay your bill.



Bitcoin BTC is now a corpse, that's just being thrown around by daytraders, because of the fading legacy of default trading pairs.  It has no future, since it can no longer compete in the real world as a currency (medium of exchange).

Especially this weekend showed, that its not about starting an alternative, but attacking BTC.

Look at people like Roger Ver. Talking his usual shit about a strong currency blablabla and takes the first chance to leave behind BTC and promote BCH. Cause he wants fast growth instead of stability. That proofs to me that those people want to make money, not being part of strengthening the most competetive CC we have. Instead of actually helping the situation he works on dividing the community. He made huge investments in BCH, while still having way more in BTC. They are investing in BCH, pushing it to the limit and then it will burst when they sell from time to time and go back to BTC.

Seems fairly obvious to me.

What can you even do with BCH? Its nothing more than an altcoin, designed to make profit, not to be used. There is a reason while basically noone actually accepts BCH, when they do accept smaller CCs.

So, Id be glad if all the gamblers that want to make quick profit, manipulate markets start their own kindergarten.

Why you think Roger Ver did not completely switch to BCH? doesnt seem like he has too much trust to me ;)

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin until the August 1, 2017 hard fork.  It still shares the same SHA-256 hashing algorithm as the original Bitcoin but it has 8 MB blocks and a DAA (difficulty adjustment algorithm) that is adjusted every 2 days compared to Bitcoin's DAA which is adjusted every 2 weeks.  



Lightning is supposed to be the one that will turn Bitcoin into a more acceptable store of value and medium of exchange, but it will be subject to the same consensus mechanism that failed SEGWIT2X last November.



Bitcoin's structural weakness will be exposed during the 2018 Seoul Winter Olympics which will run from 2/9/18 to 2/25/18.  The Korean government and Korean chaebols like Samsung and LG are determined to make this Winter Olympics the showcase for their pre-standard 5G technology and Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litcoin are determined to press their advantages over Bitcoin in terms of being a store of value, a medium of exchange and even, as a speculative asset.

Also btc could be the main blockchain and it can attach other side blockchains with different characteristics like lower fees, quickers or anything.



Btc has lots of things to show us in the future. It is much better than bch.

Bitcoin can make those changes sure but I think they have already proved that they take far too long to make the required changes and updates to stay on top of the game.



Think of it like this, MySpace always tried to implement changes and become relevant again after FaceBook picked up momentum, the point is they were too late and were always a few steps behind then.

Not only is it a BIG 'IF' I think we have to consider other factors as well, I highly doubt it will be the death of BCH. 



Bitcoin has already proved to be a coin who's team and community can't make their mind up on certain issues, saying they'll implement something then pulling out at last minute. A lot of it stems from greed from miners, it keeps the community in deadlock over vital issues and changes. Greed will be the death of Bitcoin.



Take MySpace as an example here, they forever tried to implement changes and updates when FaceBook gathered momentum, now I know this is apples and pears, two different things BUT it does have some relevance. Even if Bitcoin does implement this change, they have lost the trust from a certain portion of their community already, it could all be a little too late. What happens when they face other issues in the future that may crop up and we start facing deadlock on other matters.



I know people will argue that it's good Bitcoin don't make changes on a whim as it affects millions of people BUT it's like a company losing it's entire identity and what it set out to do. In my opinion, Bitcoin should have always implemented any change necessary to keep it's core vision and goals on track.

1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.

 

2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.

 

3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""

""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

 

4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation‚Äôs open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters

 

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map

BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.

 

edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

BitcoinCash will take the torch and provide to the world what bitcoin was always meant to be, I firmly believe that. However  we're essentially back at the drawing board in terms of adoption. We need on/off ramps that bring individuals the ability to buy/sell, merchant adoption for direct commerce,  and exchanges that aren't manipulated through tether. Things that will come in time.



The problem we face now is our ascent, and reaching mainstream in terms of the common man, if you thought battling blockstream and their troll army on social media was bad, wait until the banks turn their mainstream media machine against us. I firmly believe wall street getting involved in Bitcoin is nothing short of subversion to a competing monetary system, bitcoins name will leave a sour taste in the mouth of the average person before too much longer and the naysayers against Bitcoin will get their day of 'I told you so...'

Doesn't work like that. The idea of a confirmation system is that in order for something on the blockchain to be reversed, a malicious party would need to have enough computing power to redo the PoW from that something all the way up to the current block, faster than the real blockchain. It's not dependent upon certain numbers of confirmations (which are an arbitrary concept), but simply computing power in the abstract.



Let's use a napkin math example. Coin A has ten minute block times while Coin B has two minute block times. Both networks have 200 PH/s of total hashpower. Given these figures, a tx sent on Coin B will get five confirmations in the same time that it takes a tx sent on Coin A to get one (on aggregate). Now let's say that Malicious Party A, which controls 210 PH/s of hashpower and can thus execute a 51% attack, joins one of the two networks. You sent a tx 20 minutes ago using Coin B, and it has 10 confirmations, so it should be very secure, yes? However, Malicious Party A can redo those same 10 confirmations in less than 20 minutes, meaning that they aren't any more secure than 2 confirmations on Coin A (all things held equal).",18-02-15-01-35,8,0,[deleted],7xieh7,9236,0.07,0.133,0.796,0.9437

It really cant get much worst. Actually, it can.



112% More profitable to mine Bitcoin. 



9hrs time BTC difficulty adjustment will economically incentives miners to abandon BABC further as the profitability to mine on Bitcoin will skyrocket further. If they don't, they will lose even more money.

Add to that clusterfuck:



Prefork BSV had 75% of hash power on BCH, now BSV has the equal total hash power of entire BCH prefork. They have increased hash by 25%.



BABC has double hashpower than BSV chain. They have borrowed 175% hash & its running at a huge loss. This is a time game & time is NOT on BABC.

I've no interest in owning XRP. Ripple is a centrally controlled network which has only 2 paths it can take:



* Complete subordination to the whims of the US government and banking oligarchs. 

* Non-compliance with the demands of the US government and subsequent shutdown.



Ripple at best is an enhancement to the existing financial system.



Bitcoin is a project to replace the existing financial system with something better (something permissionless, deflationary & trust-less).

BCH isn't a duplicate of BTC.



BCH has a very real use case: it is the continuation of the Bitcoin project: a project designed to bring the whole world a p2p electronic cash system with sound money properties.



BTC is a co-opted chain which has very little to do with the Bitcoin that Satoshi designed.

BCH has no use case because no business is actually using it to do something with it. All those businesses that you mention only get payed BCH.

> Users on the XRP Ledger select a Unique Node List (UNL), a list of validators trusted by that user to order transactions. Users can select the specific validators for their own UNL or they can rely on recommended UNLs that have been compiled by other parties. The network has a number of recommended UNLs, including one list Ripple recommends, and users can choose whichever one they prefer or create their own.



The only way to be sure you are in consensus with the rest of the network is to use the Ripple recommended UNL. The fact you can opt to use other UNLs is purely academic. For practical purposes the only UNL you're going to use if you're a large economic actor on the network is the the Ripple provided one.



If you actually wanted to use a different list, you would have to first come to consensus with other validators about which to use. How do you do this? This is one of the big problems that Satoshi solved. Ripple haven't solved it using a decentralized mechanism. In Ripple's case, you use the old-school, centralized authority model. Ripple are the authoritative source of that validator-selection consensus. Hence, if the US gov wants to control the Ripple network they need only target the Ripple company.

1. That's not true. Some businesses are run by individuals who hold the BCH they earn and spend it back into the BCH economy. Some businesses have employees and they pay their employees using BCH. For example: bitcoin.com does.

2. The goal is to get more businesses to willingly act in the same way as the above. It will take time, but this has always been the goal of Bitcoin and now that Bitcoin (BCH) has been freed from the people holding it back over the last 2 or 3 years, we are once again making good progress doing that.

Good for you that XRP is being used for this purpose. You may well have problems in the future however, because BCH is designed to fulfill this purpose too. It's designed to be and is currently on track to be the first decentralized, world money that individuals and businesses can exchange with each other to settle debts anywhere in the world.

9437,"Bitcoin BTC currently has legacy status as a default trading pair, thus traders hold Bitcoin BTC as a reserve trading currency.  When the price of Bitcoin BTC goes down, a trader's buying power for other coins drops by the same amount.



But Binance is moving to Malta, and will introduce EUR trading pairs.  And Bittrex is adding USD trading pairs.



You can see that on major exchanges (GDAX, Bitstamp, etc), when there are fiat trading pairs, the fiat trading pairs dominate.



So by the end of 2018, the Bitcoin BTC trading pair dominance will be gone, and people will no longer need to hold it as a reserve trading currency.

Etherium is another example but you do not earn GAS holding ETH. But it has a far better use case than BTC or BCH and so its perceived 'inherent value' is higher than BCH and BTC. 



BCH has a promise of greater 'inherent value' due to mass adoption, but so far it's only a promise.  At this time BCH is travelling on over-hype and some pockets of adoption here and there. It does not have 'inherent value' at this point. It reached $2,200 and started a long slow bleed and then fell strongly against BTC's recent dip in value.

This time I have no choice, I have to raise money to feed family and when I have enough because I'm getting good trading I promise I'll share a lot, but for now this is what I've got.



The work I do for BCH community is spreading the usage as a payment method, but it's hard because people still don't rely on it thinking it is too easy for a hacker or something to get the crypto stored. The press is always emphasizing when this happen, but hardly we see a good cover saying how good all of this is for mankind.



I remember during the 90s brazilian government blocking savings accounts to pay old debts to IMF. A relative of mine committed suicide because of this, I sometimes imagine if BCH existed that time, a life could've been saved. By only just a transfer of 1 to 5BCH things would be right and he could support the long 18months without seeing his money. Inflation that time was 50% a month, the government acted really cowardly against C and middle class here.

 

After 27 years the government paid the old interest through a popular lawsuit, his son (my cousin) are meant to receive, no more than 200.000USD, he didn't want the money but I convinced him to get and invest a sum in charity and some BCH to distribute later.

9544,"> In other words, one day several major governments (acting under the influence of bad actors) could simultaneously implement technological and political barriers with the goal of effectively shutting down the network. Centralizing nodes and mining would make this type of operation much more likely to succeed. This is the biggest risk for cryptos, and this is why Bitcoin Core is not willing to adopt a scaling model that would increase exposure to censorship.

A crypto cannot fulfill the role of store of value unless it achieves censorship immunity. I will certainly choose the option that maximizes resistance as my store of value for cryptos - that is a no brainer.



The counter argument to this point is that if adoption is high enough because enough people are using the coin for day to day activities. such as Buying coffee and baby formula ect. That in and of itself is also a form of censorship immunity. If you have enough people using the coin and adoption is high enough it will act as a kind of zebra effect while also increasing political consequences for attempting to demonize the technology.



As long as BTC is a fringe ""store of data"" then it will be more easily subjugated to character assassination as being a ponzi scheme or a bubble. And in more extreme cases it can be used to outright associate the coin with illegal activity.



Roger does have a point that if we can get the coin into as many hands as possible for every day activity then controlling or censoring through character assassination the coin will become exponentially harder.



BTC's smaller block size also centralizes the coin in a lot of ways as well. If you are incentivized to do all of your transactions on central platforms like Coin base, exchanges or other services. Then what does it matter. The government can easily destroy the market right now by simply cracking down on exchanges. That would hit every coin not just BTC. Mass general Adoption is the only weapon against the most likely vector of attack on the coin trade.

According to Roger the properties that make BTH appeal more than BTC as digital peer-to-peer cash are the following: transaction cost, speed and network size. Ethereum has a bigger network, it processes transactions faster, but has slightly higher transaction fees.





> Would you care to elaborate on how you think perhaps this for-profit company is intending to make a profit? Do you think they're just here for charity?



They are welcome to turn a profit building a solution that will lower fees while keeping Bitcoin's chain decentralized. Likewise, it is perfectly fine for miners to want to make more money by increasing the block size. You have to look beyond that fact that actors will have different incentives to change the protocol, and just analyze the impact of the changes independently. Like I said, I am happy that Bitcoin Cash provides a solution to reduce transaction cost, but at the same time we need a backbone that peruses censorship immunity. Every corporation in the financial system, and many governments will lose power and money if cryptos succeed. They have a lot of power, if there is a breach, they will find it and orchestrate an attack. If Bitcoin's layer 2 scaling fails to deliver, then Bitcoin Cash will probably continue to flourish as a medium of exchange and Bitcoin as a store of value. The beauty of scaling via a second layer is that it requires much less censorship resistance since a complete and immediate shutdown would not cause any loss of value... all open channels would get settled at their respective expiration dates.",17-11-28-06-08,4,0,[deleted],7fxjyl,9547,0.061,0.206,0.733,0.9937

That is a very good point, but we need to get there first. I suppose the counter argument is that what you are suggesting is a paradox.

Agreed. 

And I see a very strong argument that best path to this is faster and cheaper coin with as much publicity as possible. I feel like the block size debate is ignoring the fact that its the exchanges and places to buy the currency that are most centralized and that is the greatest bottleneck. If the government wanted to strike crypto currency down those places would be the most vulnerable.



And if they did it would be a firesale on the front lawn. We need that adoption. We need every day people hooked on these coins or everything can end overnight.



> suggesting is a paradox. You can really get to mass adoption unless the system is immune to censorship. I suppose it can happen, but system will be vulnerable until we get there.



Honestly the value preposition is what drives the most adoption overall. FOMO is the most powerful tool only 2nd to putting more coins into as many hands as possible. It may actually be a good idea to do form a campaign to give away coins to people who are interested in getting started.



I find it fascinating that people would argue against use cases in a scenario where adoption is probably the only real end game strategy for the coins survival.

With Bitcoin, blocks are never full and you can thus safely rely on the fact that a 1sat fee/byte is enough for the fastest possible (next block) transaction time (you can be unlucky on both chains and experience ~30 min delays between blocks).

A UASF requires a lot of industry support and coordination. The UASF concept was combined with SegWit activation in the BIP148 proposal."" - [12]



""A soft fork is a change to the software protocol where only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible."" - [12]

For small amounts, like buying coffee or a book, this is enough of a guarantee of payment to proceed as if the transaction had been confirmed.  For larger amounts of risk, people will want to wait for a number of confirmations.  



This is the current situation on BCH - pay your coffee, the barista sees the payment come up in seconds, and you walk out of the shop.

I actually argue in favor of a rectangle around the BCH logo to make it as clear as possible, to avoid confusion.



Some prefer green some prefer orange, I don't speak for everyone.



Perhaps the unpleasantness is due to propaganda on r/bitcoin .. I did try for many months try to explain on that subreddit why a blocksize increase was necessary, and why it would not impact block propagation times or decentralisation - then I was shadowbanned without any reason being given.  So who is being un-pleasant ?



I can tell you that compared to dealing with banks and paypal, sending money with a BitcoinCash wallet is relatively pleasant.

btw, we didn't branch off BCH because we wanted to compete with LN .. we just wanted a larger block so that the massive 100MB of waiting transactions would get handled.

yep, ETH has been growing well in value .. DOGE even more rapidly - by all means cash out your BTC and invest in those, if you prefer.

you put your view very succinctly - if you like Ethereum, by all means cash out all your BTC and buy it.  



Your raise a good point - I certainly am going to trust people like Gavin Andresen more than current core developers.



Then of course I dont need to trust anyone..  I can look at the code, and look at the blockchain stats and see the mountains of transactions in the mempool day after day trying to get into the tiny 1MB block.  I can look at the actual numbers of the median and average fees and decide for myself, based on facts.



You've accepted too much r/bitcoin core bullshit yourself, without asking questions... come back when you have some facts and logic to back up your arguments.

I really mean what I say - BitcoinCash to me is what Bitcoin should have been, its closer to the original.



You can see many of the earlier Bitcoin developers argue in forums 3 years ago for a block size increase - satoshi even makes a comment about expecting blocksize to be raised before its needed.



Why Core developers ever let things get so bad, I just cannot understand - why would you prevent transactions from going thru the system?  All those people waiting to get their money sent..  its just an unforgivable decision, that goes against all the core values and goals of Bitcoin in the first 5 years.  



absolutely agree .. Bitcoin BTC works fine for storing and moving large amounts, where it is economical to pay a $20 fee. 

However I feel core devs are turning it into a system that only rich people can use.  



Anyway .. I don't mean to diss other coins, ultimately many of them work well, and are competing in an open market, and the best tech will eventually be adopted.

So with a very conservative projection 7 years in the future. If you figure 100 MB blocks paying 1 Satoshi per byte and one Bitcoin is worth $100k. That is 100 million Satoshi per block in just fees. Which is 1 bitcoin, or $100k. Plus another $300k in block reward. It only gets better from there.



If the the network doesn't think that is enough security (from the resulting profitability and hash rate, then the minimum fee rate can be raised. 1 Satoshi per byte at $100k per Bitcoin equals about 25 cents for an average transaction, figuring 250 bytes at 0.1 cents per byte.

BCH is still ramping up the part where you can buy and sell it for fiat. So for now you have to move the value to some other coin and then sell the other coin.



Don't move it to BTC. BTC is super congested and you'll pay a lot of fees for no reason.

I mean it be NICE if it was both, that means we get rewarded for being early adopted of BCH, but there is nothing i‚Äôve seen that confirms there is an actual relationship between the two.



Gold is often used as an example, often the BCH counter is that gold is actually useful, but how useful is it really? It is used for jewelry because people think its valuable, if people thought Silicon is valuable then it would be the same. I‚Äôm sure there are some rare metals used in electronics thats actually worth less than gold in weight.



Also people don‚Äôt pay another with their assets, thats why they have cash. Nobody pays another person with a square foot of their property.

Meaning someone needs to start transferring fiat into BCH. As BCH coins are limited, someone is going to have to supply or sell that BCH. So the more people actually use BCH outside of trading, the less incentive they will have to sell it. Why would you sell your dollars if you need them tomorrow to get something (maybe physical) which you can make even more money on or simply need to survive? On short to middle term I'm not seeing the difference between a store of value and actually using the coin for transactions. Albeit, the store of value might increase faster, but if BCH will be successfully used for transactions all over the world the demand will also increase and hence the price will go up.

10011,"You are assuming markets make sense in a linear way. 50% of GDP are capital markets, which means it's all just made up of supply and demand of ""speculation"" not actual use. 



For example Bitcoin now has a derivative, it is value based purely on speculation. Does this make sense outside of capitalism for the sake of capitalism? No, but this is what wall street traders want so here it is.



Gold is the same, yes it has uses, but then there are tons of materials that are used everywhere. Gold has a market simply because there is a lot of financial infrastructure built around it, such as derivatives, indexes and so on.



It's all made up stuff that crashed 2008, is it wrong? I think so, but it can't be prevented, people are free to buy and sell whatever they like.



Now coming back to BCH two points:



1) People need fiat to get something physical that is correct, but they also don't keep much of their net worth in fiat if they are smart, their money will be tied up in shares, indexes, retirement funds and what not. Just because BCH will be taken by loads of merchants (assuming this is it's future) does not mean people will start hoarding it like Bitcoin.



2) The second point is, if people are using BCH all the time, that means they are buying and selling BCH, this means there is at any given time more BCH available to buyers (supply) than BTC. Because people are holding BTC and not selling, that creates a low level a supply and artificial scarcity driving the value up. It's not different if people want Tamagotchi and nobody wants to sell them. The Tamagotchis will become more expensive.



Again,  don't think that the two are neccesarily unrelated, but I haven't read anything that would explain why price HAS to be tied with use.



In fact, on the contrary, everything that is happening with BTC suggests that being a useless/immovable coin might actually drive the value up.

10024,"I don't really agree. It's too obvious that this is a race for adoption, and that small blocks limit utility thereby slowing adoption and giving existing regimes time to mobilize. If even I can see this, others can too, certainly developers. 



People are different biologically, ideologically, culturally. Bitcoin is a very specific ideology as it pertains to truth. In fact, it is a record of reality which (as originally designed) cannot be distorted. 



But in many cultures, and among many types of people, truth must be relative. Even the genders can tend to see reality differently. When you are independent, you must rely upon hard, objective reality for your very survival. But when you are less independent, your reality is relative to that of your captors, owners, managers, or whomever will procure your survival.



Add politics, geopolitics, fiat redistribution, and in the West, the soft communism known as democracy, and we have large numbers of people incentivized to distort or deceive in whatever way necessary. Many of these people expect you are doing the same, because they actually know no other way to exist.  As a more independent type myself I do identify this as evil, but I also realize the people themselves are not always to blame. They didn't create this mess. However I consider it a tragedy that in this world they are unfortunately the enemies of objective truth and thus my own enemies.



I should qualify this by saying I don't think myself nor anyone else is truly objective, nor that others are entirely relative. It seems a full spectrum, almost like r/K selection theory, we can go back and forth.

10057,"huh? **It says ""BCC"" as currency?** Is this some older electron-cash version? Nowadays electron-cash uses BCH abbreviation for Bitcoin Cash.



If you're using any version lower than 2.9.4 you're going to be out of luck because your client doesn't have the new DAA (difficulty adjustment algorithm) so it can't sync the block headers. You're going to be on that weird fork that was made when the DAA was introduced (Nov. 17th) and then it's pretty clear it probably wont be mined for a long time since that chain is pretty much dead in the water and it's mempool probably overflowing (no replay protection against the main chain, same network used)



Please **check the network tab (tools -> network) and take a look at the block height**. For the correct Bitcoin Cash chain it should currently be **506956**. If it's lower...



**Upgrade your electron cash to version 2.9.4** (dl from [https://electroncash.org](https://electroncash.org/)) and see what things look like. 



  * If the transaction isn't there any more, redo it. The fee is certainly sufficient on the Bitcoin Cash chain and that tx should get mined next block.

  * If the transaction got mined (on the *real* Bitcoin Cash chain), it will appear as confirmed in your history

  * If the transaction still shows as unconfirmed, you can try to recreate your wallet (file -> new wallet,... using the seed or whatever you have hopefully written down (be careful, don't overwrite your current wallet, maybe copy it somewhere first to be sure)). Then the transaction shouldn't re-appear and you can make a new one.",17-12-04-14-34,3,0,[deleted],7hepna,10057,0.035,0.12,0.845,0.9685

10415,"Yes its truth, anything is possible. However, BCH is an alternative coin right now. In order to adopt BCH over the BTC, merchants would have to ask few questions 1) Why BCH and not any other Alts? 2) Is BCH better than other alts? 3) Well if we ought to adopt BCH, we may as well adopt 10 other coins?  I am sure you know, but bitstamp for long time supported only BTC trading and only recently included other coins. In fact Bitstamp for long time was (and i think still is) the major reference source regarding BTC price. So if exchange like Bitstamp would ditch BTC, why would it stop with BCH? Now, BCH doesnt have universal love like Litecoin does despite the fact that many people dislike Litecoin for having such a high marketcapt with less tehcnological improvement over other altcoins. However, in my opinion, human psychology plays a huge part in crypto, once a person decides he likes/dislikes something, its hard to change an opinion as no one wants to be proven wrong. And certainly there are a lot of people hating BCH for various reasons as simple as not being BTC or that it forked from bitcoin or that it is 'controlled' by Jihan Wu (these are just abstract examples, validity doesn't matter, there can be any reason). So any merchant adopting only BCH would loose potential customers who would refuse to use BCH and capitalism dictates that market is not left empty. Take for example Japan, they love Monacoin, so if BTC goes away, why would Japanese buy BCH over Monacoin?  In my opinion BCH doesnt have enough global support (love) to become the next bitcoin. To contradict myself, the newcomers, dont have any feelings towards any coin, and these people bring a lot of money. So with hard effort its possible to convince the new blood that BCH is the new King and hope the crowd is larger enough to over shaddow the long term holders. Lets put it this way, its possible for BCH to become the king, however it is highly unlikely. ",17-11-06-06-23,1,0,[deleted],7aznne,10415,0.1,0.124,0.777,0.5656
