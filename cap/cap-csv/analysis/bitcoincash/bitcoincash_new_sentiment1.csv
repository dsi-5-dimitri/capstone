62,"> So it's some thing like a time lasp trading?

No, there is no time lapse. Ideally the trade happens in just a few seconds. The technology uses [Payment Channels](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels) which can make many secure transactions in fractions of a second for free. Again, the way to think of it is breaking something valuable into small pieces so risk is lowered during a trade. Say I have a diamond ring and you have a ruby ring and we want to trade. If we're face to face we just hand each other the rings. If I try to keep my ring you're there to cancel the trade any way you can to keep things fair. Now, imagine we're miles apart trying to do the same thing. A trade by mail is unsafe since I can try to keep both rings. Well, since cryptocurrency is digital we can break it into tiny pieces and send them anywhere in the world instantly. Combine that with payment channels and that's Atomic Swaps. :) We just trade a tiny piece at a time keeping things balanced until all pieces have been transferred. Software handles it all, so the complete process can happen in just a few seconds!

>And this can be done with any currencies?

Theoretically, yes, any cryptocurrencies with blockchain rules that support Payment Channels, the main requirement being some kind of [Timelock](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Timelock) (which Bitcoin has supported for years).

>Do both the currencies need to be capable of atomic swaps

Yes, both currencies need to be capable of a Payment Channel. Once the software is written and a protocol established one would expect any serious cryptocurrency to ensure the feature was readily available. The logical extrapolation is at some point in the future people will be able to trade any cryptocurrency (or asset such as tokens etc) directly with others basically for free, with high security, no escrow needed, and nearly instantly. That's much safer than dealing with centralized exchanges which are subject to hacks and insider theft etc.",19-02-18-22-06,2,728,cryptos4pz,arw5wi,62,0.107,0.218,0.675,0.3818,9

Not sure how you come up with that, or how I would dispute it. Unless you assume that literally everyone sold after the split to the same guy?

1 - Crypto exchanging

2 - Local cash volatility

&#x200B;

The first problem is related to their laws according which you can't exchange crypto into USD. So you have to find ways to exchange crypto into cash (USD or EUR better) and keep it outside the county. 

The 2nd problem is that if your cash transfer (in their local currency) takes 2 or 3 hours, you can lose up to 30% because of inflation.

&#x200B;

That's why I would recommend them to use crypto backed lending platforms which provide European banks accounts. For example, Youhodler offers EU bank account, LTV up to 80% and USDT and withdrawal option. I think it will be the best way to avoid their current crisis. What do you think about it?",19-02-14-07-00,1,1922,joycejmoore7,aqarba,160,0.0,0.792,0.20800000000000002,0.5859,5

163,"Very grateful for the information.

&#x200B;

The question is: how do you manage to open an account in this type of platform with a Venezuelan passport, since most of the exchanges, loan platforms, etc. do not accept Venezuelans for this type of process to which you mention.

&#x200B;

Regarding your two previous observations, I comment, the exchange usually occurs from crypto to crypto in friendly stores with cryptocurrencies that accept payments of this type. There you avoid the need to have to resort to cash. On the other hand, although the UDS is not legal currency, 60% of the transactions occur in this type of currency currently in the streets and commerce of the country.

&#x200B;

On the second point, it is avoided first with the point previously exposed. Second, you make direct transfers between the same banks through platforms like Localbitcoins. In other words, you can exchange cryptos for cash with a buyer / seller of local currency of the same bank so that the transfer is direct and instantaneous.

&#x200B;

Finally, mining is very profitable in the country, and low profile or legal (if you prefer to register on the government website and be under your radar) is highly profitable and efficient.

&#x200B;

In particular my expenses for electricity for 6 S9 machines and pair of Nvidia 1080Ti GPUs do not reach the monthly nor 1 cent per month the ELECTRICITY MONTHLY BILL.

278,"So I did a little googling to figure out the number of transactions on Credit Cards alone. Just going to be thinking outloud for the remainder of the comment - haven't processed any errors or other thoughts, fyi. 

In 2012 it was around 24 Billion general transaction (not including businesses and travel)

In 2016 it has increased to roughly 34 billion. 

That's a 41% increase in the number of transactions, so roughly 10% increase every year, steadily. 

BCH is designed to replace those CC transactions (plus cash and debit card transactions, but we'll stick to just CC for now). 

Assuming that increase remains somewhat steady we can just increase the number of transactions per year by 10%. 

BCH should hit 21 Million in 2140 I think. That's 124 years from now. So a possible 1240% increase in the number of general CC transactions. 

from 34 Billion in 2016 - we'd hit 455,600,000,000 or 455.6 Billion transactions. At $.01 transaction fees - thats roughtly $4.5 Billion dollars in fees alone, per year. Just accounting for general CC transaction volume of 2016 vs 2140. 

This could all be super wrong, but made sense as I went through. 

You'd also have to think about the data that will be in the blockchain by then and how valuable that will be. Google alone is worth 766 Billion today, and literally doesnt charge for 99% of their services. Data mining is a huge profit. Miners of the BCH blockchain will have all of that data at their finger tips to be able to sell however they see fit.

Essentially, no one sided with the idea that BSV was even a contender for the ticker. 

The BSV chain, though, has not put in replay protection. Meaning that if you send BCH coins from a wallet before the fork, you‚Äôd actually be sending both your BCH and BSV coins at the same time, to the same place.

Real answer here u/Scheroxx, is that hardforks aren't backwards compatible and therefore all should upgrade.

Also, it doesn't mean hardforks are bad and it doesn't mean that is the only way to create splits. BCH forked off without BTC having a hardfork simply because there was lots of support for a larger block (and without segwit) chain. Hardforks can even keep networks healthier by ""forcing"" nodes to keep up to date with improvements.

If you had unsplit BCH coins, then the above method should work, and you should be done.

If your BSV coins do NOT show up at CoinEx, then you'll have to manually send them over (see below).

Point out to them that they control the change address on this transaction (1NPBao1ApakvuAQoqG4NNxQK1zPqasuFSr)

* Transaction information from today's transaction. Again, just prove to them that they made this transaction, and show them how you accidentally sent the money to a Coinbase-controlled address (which you already have proven to them that they control).

* Suggest to Coinbase that they implement a safety check for customer-initiated withdrawals, which simply checks to see if a recipient address is one of their own, and provide a warning to the user if so.

Note that another wallet can only split and protect the funds if Jaxx has not received any pure BCH or BSV funds since the split. Both BSV and BCH need to be sent out and actually replayed when sending to an external wallet.

For splitting BSV out, give Edge a try ([https://edge.app](https://edge.app)). Just send money to Edge and make sure both BSV and BCH were sent in the same transaction by checking both BCH and BSV blockexplorers. Then tap the 3 dots to the right of your BCH wallet in Edge and choose Split BSV.

Note that if you send more BCH to Edge after the split operation, you‚Äôll have to redo the Split function in order to replay protect your new funds.

BCH adoption is a done deal, but SV has great potential, and will be in symbiosis with Bitcoin (BCH). Craig (Satoshi) is such an intelligent and passionate leader. We are very lucky. Him and Roger are not fighting, the two chains aren't conflicting, just waiting for Jihan and his n-sync clown posse to fuck off. They are colluding in order to give the Asian scam/miner/eth complex a taste of its own medicine, by creating lies, diversion, etc.  Nobody knows what the fuck is going on, except BCH and BSV are now top dog, and miners are soon to be irrelevant, ESPECIALLY in 2020 after the next halving.  


What's most important, is that we have Bitcoin Cash, and BitcoinSV (high ledger utility, very different from BCH but it in a good way) locked down. We own soooo many of them (the real people) and people like Jihan and crap didn't even see it coming - this is what drives their bitterness and fear towards BCH more than any other coin. BSV just topped the cake and will be the last straw before it all crumbles.  


These two coins (Bitcoin and BSV), along with their small supply, will be more than enough to corner foreign markets, push their insolvent asses into into trading BCH shares (like [coinex.com](https://coinex.com) for example), and eventually render their entire cryptosphere obsolete and dangerously volatile for the end of time. Eth will die. Russian scammers will starve. Bitcoin and BSV will fulfill the roles of everyone and everything. Bitcoin for p2p electronic cash. BSV for real world scaling and robust architecture - most importantly one not run and managed by a bunch of scammy cucks.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoYnZ6CAoAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoYnZ6CAoAk) watch this video, realize you are wrong, embrace BCH and SV before it's far too late.

628,"Well, go check the bitcoin.com FAQ. 

And more importantly, look for ""who keeps the private key "".

Very likely it's the website, so they should hold it all. Maybe wait until they provide fork?? ",18-12-28-14-43,1,36,ToBitOrNotToBit,aa6ktf,628,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3
629,"I was in the very same position as you a few hours ago. The answer...

&#x200B;

a) If your pre-split BCH is in a custodial wallet like the one used by Coinbase and most exchange services), then youi must wait until they offer the alternate chain wallet. There is no way for you to claim your Bitcoin SV (or whatever chain they have neglected), until they support the chain, at least for the purpose of allowing you to send out your coins.

b) If you have a paper wallet, hardware wallet or a device wallet or a service for which you really control private keys, then you can claim both Bitcoin Cash ABC and SV by sending the coins to a wallet that contains a split feature with ad hoc replay protection. Edge wallet for Android and IOS is one such wallet.

&#x200B;

The process is easy with just one caveat.\*

* Create a new Edge wallet on Android or IOS.
* Send coin from a private, pre-split wallet that has not received coins after the Nov 2018 fork.
* From the Edge menu, click the SPLIT option.

That's all there is to it. The Edge wallet will automatically create a second BCH SV wallet and you will have the same number of coins in both ABC and SV wallets. They can now be sent or spent independantly.

But wait! Can the original Edge wallet still receive and split PRE-fork coins and continue to support the split function? On this point, I am not clear.

&#x200B;

\* I said that there was a caveat. I have completed a successful test with $100 import & split. But I have not yet split the rest of my BCH. I am awaiting an answer to this question:

In earlier threads, I have read warnings that each Edge wallet can only split BCH once. Therefore, it was necessary to create a second wallet after performing a small test receipt / split -- and before sending additional BCH from a pre-fork hardware wallet.

&#x200B;

Is it still necessary to create another BCH wallet before proceeding with a second receipt? I have seen conflicting information. One reader suggests that Edge can now accept pre-fork BCH into a wallet that already has split-ABC coins.",18-12-28-14-43,1,4,Ellery_Davies,aa6ktf,629,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3

BCH is a continuation of the original Bitcoin project. As such, it implements an easy to use, cash system which should scale up to billions of users. This is an extremely motivating and exciting project for many of us. This is especially exciting for people who want personal sovereignty and who truly comprehend how the present fiat money systems most of us use, enslave us and fund terrible things like war and economic turmoil.

BTC is no longer following the ideals and goals of the original Bitcoin project. It is not promoted as a cash system and there appears to be no intention within the BTC culture to service the transactions of billions of people on chain.

735,"First off, bch and btc are both bitcoin. Bitcoin is a protocol for p2p electronic cash, the details of which are laid out in Satoshi's white paper. BTC and BCH are two different implementations of the Bitcoin protocol.

That said, which implementation is actually better is entirely subjective. Here are some reasons why I and many others think that BCH implements bitcoin better.

- **Decentralization** One of the biggest selling points of bitcoin is the idea that you are in full control of your money. With no bank or other 3rd party controlling it, you don't have to trust anyone but yourself with what belongs to you. In btc core, they added SegWit which, without getting into technical details, allows for off-chain scaling solutions like the lightning network. The problem with LN is that it requires you to trust a 3rd party with your transactions, completely defeating one of the main purposes of bitcoin. This is (iirc) one of the main reasons that BCH originally forked.

- **Speedy Transactions and Low Fees** The reason that SegWit and LN were first introduced to btc was to attempt to fix the problem of scaling and increase transaction speed. Transactions in BTC are very slow and take a long time unless you pay a hefty transaction fee (and are often still slow even if you do). While BTC tries to solve this problem with 2nd layer solutions such as SegWit+LN, BCH uses an adjustable blocksize cap (hence BitcoinABC). This approach not only solves scaling issues, speeding up the network and lowering transaction fees, but also solves the problem of increased centralization that comes with increased block size by allowing smaller blocks to be processed as well.

- **Differing Goals** The biggest reason for the differences between the two coins is the differences in their goals. BTC is attemting to be an investment/store of value while BCH, in sticking to the original white paper, trys to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash. These goals obviously require very different things. In this regard, it ultimately comes down to what you want out of your coins.

- **Attitudes and Censorship** This point is more of a generalization and what I'm about to say does not necessarily apply to everyone in either community, but is rather an analysis of general trends that I've seen. There is a tendency for BTC forums such as r/bitcoin to be heavily censored against saying anything remotely good about bch or any other ""altcoins"", as well as a general negative attitude and closed-mindedness toward anything other than core. By contrast, bch-friendly communities such as here and r/btc tend to be much more open-minded and willing to discuss other coins. Again, I'm not saying that any of this applies to everyone in either camp, this is simply my observations.

These are some of the main reasons for me, hope this helps :)",18-12-23-22-44,8,4596,MrJoshTheEpic_,a8u30h,735,0.0,0.136,0.8640000000000001,0.0258,22

737,"BCH is virtually free to send (avg tx fee on BCH now is around $ 0.01 and you can easily send free tx), so BCH is true peer-to-peer electronic cash.  BCH on-chain tx confirmations are faster, especially when the BTC chain sees a surge in volume when the mempool backs up.  BTC fees can get ridiculously high at times of higher volume for any users wanting an on-chain transaction to get confirmed within the next few blocks. This is due to the very small 1 MB block-size cap that BTC maintained even after the volume outgrew that cap (the 1 MB cap was put in as a temporary measure in 2010 to protect the network against spam attacks while the network was in its infancy).  

Having said all of that, BTC kept the ticker and the name, thus has far greater presence in ther market, higher demand and far higher coin value.  BTC is still a good asset to hold long term, but  BCH appears undervalued in the current bear market, thus BCH coin value appreciation should most likely be greater in the coming years.",18-12-23-22-44,4,487,sph44,a8u30h,737,0.079,0.0,0.9209999999999999,-0.2263,22

Now  you should switch your wallet into SV chain, to do this you can simply  select a different server from the network tab. Right click by mouse on  it and pick 'Use as server'. Here is list of SV chain servers : https://1inks.cc/KCFJ1

808,"> can i get bitcoin sv for every bch.

yes. you already have them. The same keys give access to bch and bsv coins.

> is there timelimit when and where can i change them ?

you don't ""change"" or ""claim"". You already own and have control.

You just need a wallet that allows you to work with your BSV. electron-cash is a good one, it works with trezor.

However when you send prefork BCH you have a problem: your transaction will be valid on BCH chain AND on BSV chain and it will most likely be ""replayed"" (copied from one network to the other), so you have to ""split"" your prefork coins.

here is a tutorial how to split: https://medium.com/@antsankov/how-to-safely-split-bch-and-bsv-coins-using-electron-cash-w-pictures-ba2d2935b4cc",18-12-20-13-39,2,2063,moleccc,a7thoz,808,0.08900000000000001,0.0,0.9109999999999999,-0.3919,4
809,"> can i just send my old bch from trezor to exchange site ?

NO, don't do it without thinking!!! you will probably send BOTH BCH and BSV if you just do it without first splitting (see my other post).

Some exchanges auto-split your coins (like kraken) and maybe coinex (not sure, anyone?). So you could use one of those exchanges. Be careful not to walk into a trap. There might be people trying to scam you offering ""split service"" or similar.

I don't know if it's fair to characterize it as a handful of multinationals.  BTC is essentially controlled by a small group of the core developers with the keys to the code repository who co-founded a company called Blockstream (Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille).  Blockstream began working on LN and its founders, for reasons that are likely a direct conflict of interest, fought to keep the BTC block-size cap at the very small 1 MB level which did not allow for any on-chain scaling while Bitcoin was increasing in popularity.  The 1 MB cap had been introduced back in 2010 as a temporary cap to protect the network against spam attacks when it was in its infancy (when spamming the network would have been incredibly cheap for anyone wanting to rock the boat). By keeping the 1 MB cap in place, the blocks began filling up regularly by early 2016, and as usage grew, backlogs ensued, thus delays in tx confirmations and increasing fees. The fees got so bad in 2017 that sending a single tx often cost over $50, sometimes closer to $100 to get it included in the next block. The conflict of interest is obvious, and the sad part is the small block size data cap stifled BTC right when it was betting very popular and had the opportunity to massively increase adoption. With utility diminished, many prospective bitcoin users lost interest, and the market subsequently declined in 2018, as we all know.",18-12-19-04-15,8,487,sph44,a7d0om,867,0.073,0.358,0.569,0.8595,31

This is not the case.  *Censorship resistance* is the goal and decentralization is the vehicle by which it is achieved.  I say *resistance* and not *proof* because the latter implies perfect resistance which further implies a perfect *system* of resistance and there is no such thing as a perfect system.

Even today as we're getting closer to 2019, most people still don't know a lot about crypto currencies let alone what a hard fork is and how many other alt coins have spawned since the 2017 bitcoin craze.

Yes, it is very confusing to those who just got into the fray because 10 years after bitcoin was born, things have changed significantly and even being out of the scene for only a year and coming back can be a daunting task indeed.

On November 15th, bitcoin cash went through a hard fork where some of the developers had stark, contrasting ideas for the future of bch. This resulted in Bitcoin cash becoming bch ABC and bch SV. (now bch ABC is referred to as the original bitcoin cash and bch SV now is being referred to just bitcoin SV).

If you had bitcoin cash in a wallet or an exchange before this fork, your bitcoin cash are entitled to an 'airdrop' or a duplicate amount of coins for bitcoin SV as well. If you had your bch on an exchange, your coins will be split for you. But if you had it in an electron cash wallet or a cold storage wallet ledger, you will need to follow their directions on how to correctly split them.

The million dollar question that people are still trying to figure out is, which of the two is going to be successful and have their coins shoot for the moon? No one knows because bitcoin itself is doing terribly these days, and when bitcoin does poorly you can pretty much say that other crypto-currencies in general do poorly as well. And when bitcoin surges, others follow. You could say that bitcoin itself is still very important in the cryptocurrency world still, even as it's technology is becoming 'clunky' in today's terms and it's only a matter of time before the media and the rest of the folks pick up on this and deem the next successor, etc...

So the best thing you can do now is sit back, get your coins split if you held on to some bch before the fork and keep watching the price flow until 1st quarter of 2019 where things might break out or some potential crypto currency might lead the pack. Or you can do what many others are doing as we speak, quietly pick and choose coins you think might be worth it some day, because right now they're all dirt cheap and it's not going to last forever.

975,There is no advantage of quicker block packaging. If the TX is in the mempool and the pool is properly maintained/destributed than it is pretty safe to assume that the Transfer is valid and will execute. The amount of confirmation needed for an exchange is their decision. It is based on how safe is the TX in a certain block depth(how deeply buried underneath the most recent block). This is to prevent reorganisation of blocks.  If they require 10 confirmations with current circumstances than means that they want 100 minutes to pass after the TX creation so consider it safe. If you change the code and you create 10 blocks in 10 minutes  than they will raise it to 100 confirmations because they want to have a certain amount of time passed between the Output signiture  (TX creation) and the most recent block.

It constantly proves that the technology is evolving and catching up with the 2 years backlog on development. If you check LTC, their roadmap is just ""wait until Bitcoin does something and copy the code"". You can read these comments from their own developers. It doesn't bring anything to the table, it is missing the added value hence it's called Lite. By the way did you know that ETH was a Project created for Bitcoin? The inventor has been chased away and he created ETH and smart contracts.

1. NOBODY knows if it's a good time to buy anything. Anyone who tells you different is lying. Lots of people make their living pretending to know, but nobody holds them accountable when they're wrong. They just get to keep on making BS predictions about the future and cherry picking the times they got lucky.
2. Nobody knows what the future holds. The best ideas, and the best protocols aren't necessarily going to be the winning blockchain(s). There are a thousand factors, including merchants, investors, governments, miners, developers, awareness, ease of use, adoption, the list goes on. And nobody can quantify them all accurately.
3. You cannot ask other people to tell you what to do. Because when the price goes up or down you won't know why you own the thing in the first place. You should ONLY invest in coins because you believe they have some strong advantage and future potential.

I'm not trying to get rich, I'm trying to help make it a reality for the whole world. By my rationale it's always a good time to buy BCH.

First step would be to import your wallet (is it HD wallet? Do you have the seed? BIP 39? or do you have a list of private keys? this will all work) into [electron-cash](https://electroncash.org/).

Electron-cash will only show / work with BCH and BSV (you can switch chain in network dialog), not BTC. You can leave the BTC in your old wallet, they will not move by actions taken in electron-cash.

1056,"Hi there,  


If you own some of these I would highly recommend to learn a bit about how these keys are working so you can understand it and therefore better protect them. The book Mastering Bitcoin is a very good source of information as you can search for keywords in the PDF and can read up specific terms and their uses. I'll give you a hint and attempt to help you understand why you own all forked coins from the moment of chain split if you have the private key:

>Bitcoin‚Äôs transactions are based on the concept of spending ‚Äúoutputs‚Äù, which are the result of previous transactions, to create a transaction chain that transfers ownership from address to address. Our wallet has now received a transaction that assigned one such output to our address. Once this is confirmed, we can now spend that output.

So the public address(key) is where the coins are assigned to, and the private key is what you need to sign a transaction, what basically just changes the public address(key) the coin is assigned to. I won't go into details of multiple inputs and outputs, lets just stick to an example where we are sending 1BTC with 0 fee.   
That is one input of 1 BTC and 1 output of the same BTC. Since you have the private key you can sign this transaction no matter which chains they are on. So you own all the coins at the point when you are possessing your own private key. If there is a hard fork with chain split, that mean at a time there are two identical copy of the ledger with the same spendable coins but the transactions from that point will be incompatible therefore different transactions can be signed on both sides of the chains with the same Private Key.

""We recommend consolidating your BCH into one wallet address before November 15 and making sure not to use the BCH network during the hardfork(s) planned for November 15. Consolidating your BCH into one wallet prior to the fork will make it easier to split your funds up and move funds to wallets and/or exchanges that support alternative coins after the fork takes place. Your BCH wallet(s) might contain multiple inputs with a different private key assigned to each input. Moving those inputs to one address will make it so you only have to extract one private key instead of multiple.""

If that doesn't work, then you'll have to use Electron Cash wallet to manually send your BCH & BSV coins separately (see below).

1431,"coinbase is a custodial wallet (if you can even call it that)... more like a depository or bank. They are in control of your coins (they will even block certain recipient addresses afaik, i.e. engage in censorship). blockchain.info is a wallet which puts *you* in control of your funds. This means that when push comes to shove and their wallet software (a webpage essentiall) doesn't allow you to do what you want to do (like access coins from some obscure fork) you can always extract your private keys (or hd wallet seed) from blockchain.info. not from coinbase. coinbase just *owes* you money and you're at their merit regarding getting tokens from any forks. If they deem the fork important enough they might give you the tokens, after a pretty long wait. Have they released the BSV to their customers yet? They're definitely planning to.

1441,">As I understand it there are 2 chains without replay protection. Is it safe to make transactions in this situation?

Yes, but you should [split your coins first](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9zx65e/deposit_to_coinbase/eacsq6n). This is a one time thing, after that, all transactions dependent on those transactions are safe from being replayed on the other chain. BSV claims to be implementing replay protection in the future, making transactions after that safe on both chains, even if they had not been previously split. But if you want to spend before then you need to split your coins.

>Can BCH have all transactions reorged back to the split if one of the chains wins?

No, this won't happen. BCH and BSV are separate chains, with different rules, and have been since Nov 15th.",18-11-27-01-37,2,178,loomenaughty,a0juq9,1441,0.0,0.131,0.8690000000000001,0.168,4
1442,Thanks everyone for explanation. I read today that it was confirmed that coins will be properly split with replay protection soon. SV will go its own path. Hopefully no more fud and everyone will have their own way ...,18-11-27-01-37,1,1119,logicalDust,a0juq9,1442,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4
1443,"@logicalDust, actually at this point bchabc has essentially won the hash war. The problem is that currently bchsv is still not giving up and is refusing to 'die off' their weaker chain.

On top of that, some of the precious miners who came from btc to bch to assist is now either going back and leaving the bchabc hashpower they created or completely leaving mining entirely because of losing profits and this in itself is causing plummeting prices as a result.

Since we don't have the miners like we used to on either is causing wild market fluctuations while bcsv is steadily remaining vigilant which may or may not catch up to the bchabc blockchain sometime in the near future and cause another dilemma for bch in general? Who knows...

As far as transactions on either chain right now, it is safe to say that it can be done with electron cash wallets and there are couple of good thorough walkthroughs to have your coins successfully split safely as long as you choose the correct stable network for either blockchain.

Also, exchanges are still unclear about the winner because each exchange had their own set of rules for the split if one had their bch's before the snapshot split on nov 15th.

And lastly, orphaned blocks were most riskiest during nov 15 and subsequent couple days thereafter. At this point with a defined split fork if such an orphaned block were to occur, all you would need to do is to simply wait for the valid blocks to become longer than the invalid one for it to be accepted by the network.

Or if you're like the majority out there who's still jilted with the crashing prices and further uncertainty about bch in general, just continue to wait it out and like every crash the market will always recover and prices will hopefully return and shoot to new heights... just maybe.",18-11-27-01-37,1,117,Chancellor-Parks,a0juq9,1443,0.174,0.13699999999999998,0.688,-0.5770000000000001,4

You know the ones I mean; they can be seen in many threads comparing notes on who's been tagged on their respective virtual manifests as SV shills/trolls.

This in turn edges the group closer to becoming an echo chamber, which if allowed to continue for too long, would for all intents and purposes render the group as pointless as /r/bitcoin. 

This group doesn't need week minded NPCs who kowtow to the troll hunters; it needs people who aren't afraid of disagreement, who aren't afraid of the bogeyman, and who are willing to discuss ideas openly in the pursuit of learning, knowledge and truth.

1613,"If you're looking for advice I'd say hedge. If you literally *only* have the 1 BCH: 

- First, its important to know the goals of your investment. BCH is striving to be **THE** global currency. Some of the people you meet here actually believe that it can and will be, including myself. We believe that some day people won't trade goods for government owned currencies and won't rely on, or trust, banks (exchanges) to give them the money they're owed. Instead, everyone will have immutable, uncensorable money that they can spend anywhere and however they see fit. We all will be 100% responsible for ourselves.  

    - If you're not here to see that through than hold until you can sell when you're at a profit, or sell now if you can't wait that long. 

- Second, that's a lot more than a lot of other people have or will ever have (compared to global pop.) As an owner of 1 in 21 million of the global money supply, you'd be extremely wealthy. That said, you have room to hedge, and I would advise to do so. 

  - Yes, I believe BCH will be the global currency, but I'm also smart enough to know that I may be wrong. Most of my holding are in BCH, but I also have holdings in other coins as well. Other coins that are striving for the same goal and other coins that have completely different goals. 

- Lastly, I think you missed the opportunity for short term *massive* gains. I think you could still achieve gains in the short term, but the days of lotto like money over night have come and gone. That was back in 2016ish. I was spending my Bitcoin on dark web weed at that point and missed the massive gains as well :) But that's because I wasn't investing.

Your conclusion is based on a completely fictitious narrative. Core has no power to define consensus rules. They don't even hash. Any change Core makes to the software still needs to be vetted and adopted (or not as in the case of BIP 100 & 101) by the rest of the ecoystem. They have no power to be coercive.

3. The network works fine today. Although the merchant decides if the transaction is valid. If they have a ABC node than the transaction has to be at least valid on the ABC chain. Some merchants want the transaction to be valid on both chains (like yours/moneybutton). There are no merchants at the moment that accept SV only coins.

2304,"I think people simply rushed to buying these coins because media started literally bombarding everyone about Bitcoin, and how fast it is growing, and how regular people get extremely rich by trading it etc. Then, others figured out that they can create their own coins and make people believe that their coins' price will rise as sharply as BTC's did. Everyone started buying and buying different coins - ""building investment portfolios"" - and now almost everything crashed (99% are in negative side of growth right now for sure).

&#x200B;

**Scenario 1: SV wins, ABC loses:** 

Do you believe that Roger Ver and Bitmain just accept their defeat, start mining and supporting SV? Because I'm not sure that is going to happen. And besides that: Nearly everybody will know that SV is Craigs personal Coin and totally centralized. I don't believe it will have a similar value like BCH has it now, and even less of course if the Bitmain-Roger-group would cash out and leave.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 2: ABC wins, SV loses:** 

Do you believe that a guy who [threatens to crash Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1062751765601361923) to win this war would accept his defeat and start supporting and mining ABC? I don't believe that he really could bring Bitcoin down but most likely he has enough BCH to bring ABC down significantly if 1) ABC should win and 2) Craig would dump. And I have not much doubt about 2 because he doesn't seem to be a stable character. 

&#x200B;

In short: Both groups have a lot of Coins on the winning chain and, in my opinion, both groups are not likely to accept a potential defeat without going into destruction-mode. 

&#x200B;

And there are more potential destructive scenarios... If guerilla-tactics should be used to hurt the competing chain over time etc. At the moment I find it hard to imagine a positive scenario in which the winning BCH will trade at current levels. But, I would like to hear other opinions and actually there must be many since BCH didn't drop as if many would believe something like the above will happen.

At the time of the fork, the chain will split into two, due to different consensus rules. The SV chain (right now at least, subject to change) has the majority hash so it's chain (from the split) will grow faster. The ABC chain will grow more slowly.

From there its speculation...

A. Could be that SV decides to attack and take down the ABC chain, forcing exchanges, users etc to roll with the general idea that SV is BCH.

B. Could be that the exchanges, users etc hold fast and BCH basically says as-is (ABC).

Then for each of those two main cases there's a chance that the ""unaccepted"" chain goes on to do it's own thing. If the minority chain (however minority is determined) lives on, then there may be two coins depending on whether users and exchanges pick up that chain. Will also need wallet support etc.

Right now, anything could happen. Social consensus is as muddy AF. Hash power tends to point towards SV becoming the only chain. The only way to know for sure, is wait and see. It could be quick or it could be drawn out for weeks or even months.

2567,"Yes. But you need to understand what it means when you say

>held thru ledger 

Ledger is just a device that stores your private keys securely. Through Ledgers software, Ledger Live, those keys grant you access to your coins which are actually stored on the blockchain. Think of it like this. 

Imagine there is a safe, storing your BCH, that only your private keys access. Ledger's software, Ledger Live, gives you access to the BCH safe and the keys your Ledger wallet is holding open that safe. 

Now a split happens, there are 2 safes opened by the same keys. A BCH safe and A BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) safe. Both safes can be open by the same keys, which are held on your Ledger wallet. 

Here's the difference though - Ledger Live, Ledger's software may only grant access to the BCH safe if they don't support the BSV split. **But**, your keys on the Ledger wallet still opens any of the safes. You may just have to use a different, third party, software (other than Ledger Live), with the keys that are on your Ledger wallet, to access the other safes. 

Electron-Cash is a third party software that lets you use the keys on your Ledger wallet to access the ""other safe"", or the BSV blockchain, if you want. Important to note that if you're using your Ledger device with Electron-Cash, you are still 100% as safe as if you used Ledger Live software. [Here's](https://electroncash.org/nov2018.html) some info on that. 

That 24 word seed phrase that you wrote down, when you started up your Ledger wallet, is your private key. That same key allows you to access any of the blockchains. 

TLDR - If you control the key, which you're currently storing on your Ledger wallet, you have access to any and all split coins that ever will be. Period.

2610,"ABC's lead developer is named Amaury Sechet.  He's a pretty reasonable guy.  Just a unimpressive yet dedicated software developer, as were most early Bitcoiners.  His client was, until recently, the most popular bch client.  Companies like Bitmain and Bitcoin.com run ABC on their mining nodes.

nChain is run by a guy named Craig Wright who claimed he was Satoshi a few years back but never gave any proof.  He's generally obnoxious and offensive.  nChain released a competing BCH implementation called Bitcoin SV a few months ago.  His primary backer is a guy named Calvin Ayre, who made billions pioneering online gambling when the internet was young.

BCH was created after a prolonged debate about increasing the block size through a hard fork or activating something called segwit with no fork (I personally prefer BTC and segwit).  People had been calling for a fork to increase the block size since 2015, but were never able to reach enough consensus, so it didn't happen.  Out of this frustration, the people who created BCH decided there would be a hard fork every 6 months (which is really aggressive).

So with BCH you're basically signing up for a hard fork every 6 months.  That's scheduled to happen next week.  Right now, all the buzz is about making it possible to run smart contracts on BCH.  ABC wants to add a feature (opcode) called OP_DSV to do this.  Craig Wright didn't agree with this approach because he thinks it infringes on his patents, and by controlling 51% of the hash can essentially block any OP_DSV transactions from taking place.

It's not clear what will happen.  ABC could change the hashing algorithm or add replay protection, which would essentially create a new coin.  However, that wouldn't be a good look for a currency that claims to be the ""original bitcoin"" (which it's not IMHO).  Alternatively, someone like Bitmain could redirect their hash power from BTC and regain 51% of the hashrate, but that would be unprofitable.

I know it's wishful thinking, but I'm hoping that some of the BCH crowd realize they're getting a taste of their own medicine, and grudgingly return to BTC.  I think there's room for compromise.  If there's another surge, I personally think that a hard fork to increase the block size could reach consensus.  Segwit is a good technology, we're better equipped to implement features like smart contracts now. 
 However, I understand there were a lot of hard feelings on both sides, so I try to be respectful to people with different viewpoints than me.",18-11-12-07-56,5,1015,jjduhamer,9w7e86,2610,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,29

But my main job was to set up an engagement with the new lawyers ‚Ä¶ and transfer Wright‚Äôs intellectual property to nCrypt‚Äô ‚Äì a newly formed subsidiary of nTrust.

2684,"The decrease in difficulty was due to the fact that a majority of SHA256 miners were unwilling to take the risk of building on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain when a majority of the miners, and what ""appeared"" to be a majority of ""users"" were supporting BTC - regardless of whether that choice was in their best interest or not. (Which is odd, unless of course those users don't actually exist and are part of a manufactured effort to create the facade of consensus.)

&#x200B;

Since only 10% of all sha256 miners even bothered to start mining BCH rather than BTC, the difficulty adjustment algorithm had to be tweaked from the original 2016-block adjustment to what was first called the EDA, and then to an updated algorithm called the DAA which is currently in use and adjusts difficulty for an average of 6 blocks an hour, taking rapid swings in hashpower into account.

&#x200B;

An increase in block size does not correlate to a decrease in difficulty unless that block size increase results in a chain split, or miners who do not necessarily believe in larger blocks (for some reason) might simply abandon mining for some other business venture... maybe : ). Increase in block size correlates to user adoption - which in turn, correlates to more revenue for miners and an increase in the price of BCH as it becomes more valuable as a means of exchange. That in turn results in more competition between miners, which ideally should increase difficulty, of course there are miners who understand that they can exploit difficulty adjustment algorithms (even the one on BTC) to maximize profit. So sometimes hashpower seems to disappear.",18-11-10-03-04,5,74,therotten7015,9vlnp8,2684,0.084,0.022000000000000002,0.893,-0.687,2
2685,"First of all, the discussions of block size are about a maximum limit not about actual sizes. Despite BCH having a higher limit than BTC, it's average block size is still smaller than BTC (at least last time I checked).

It has almost nothing to do with difficulty. Difficulty drops because miners are split between two different chains, and as market value changes, miners chase the most profitable coin for them to mine. Or they speculate that a coin will increase in value and is worth a portion of their hash rate.

> When bitcoin forked to BTC and BCH, one BCH had a value that was about a tenth of one bitcoin. But why was this? Was it because the block size was increased or because of different things?

It is because of a combination of market preference and inertia. BTC kept the ticker and most exchanges looked at BCH skeptically and were reluctant to adopt until it showed market viability, and than when it showed viability it took them time to incorporate it and to safely split their BTC/BCH holdings.

> Because when the block size will be increased again on 15th November, won‚Äôt the difficulty decrease and thus, BCH (ABC) will drop in price?

Difficulty will decrease because miners will be split between three different chains (BTC, BSV, ABC). But again miners chase profitability (which includes speculations on value). You basically have this relationship inverted, difficulty follows profits and not the other way around. Most people buying and selling cryptocurrency in the market don't care about mining difficulty, they don't price the coins based upon difficulty, so it is a much looser relationship than hash power chasing profits.

There is a slight relationship between all these things that someone could draw up though. Miner debts make a difference for example. If miners spend a certain amount of electricity, they will only want to sell their mined coins if they go for a value higher than the amount they spent mining them. This withholds coins from the market when prices are too low, and can reduce price drops, but they may also gamble by shorting, selling their coins at current prices in hopes of buying them back at floor prices, effectively repositioning their holdings, but this is obviously risky and not something they want to do, they would much rather sell when the prices are high.

>DSV is purposely designed to allow for bucket-shops, which are illegal gambling operations, the ability to have unregulated, unlicensed ICOs expand, to do things like image sales and dark web sites, to enable people to have one of the things already in progress is silk road version 2, they want to build that into bitcoin and they think making an illegal system that flaunts its illegality at government is going to actually be a good thing. I don't really care what they say, bitcoin is neutral money, money has to be neutral, cash is used for criminal activity because its money, but its not designed for criminal activity, and if you try and take bitcoin and redesign it to be illegal, specifically purposely designed to be illegal, I'm sorry you don't get that choice.

 I remember the days of 2017 BTC congestion like they were yesterday, I was paying $8 - $15 in fees and the transactions sometimes took 4+ hours to move, it was truly a nightmare.   Today is much different, as you well know,  if i send BTC from my wallet on [blockchain.](https://blakchain.info)com i pay usually $0.01 - $0.04 in transaction fees and the transaction speed is incredibly fast.

My follow-up question is , when i look at coinmarketcap.com I see BTC transacting 4.6 billion USD a day which in terms of volume is slightly less than half of the  fall/winter  of 2017 levels. Today if the volume of transactions were doubled, would we be facing the same issues we faced back in '17 or has the network improved?  i.e. segwit(2) , lightening network.

 This is a major clue in the answer of my question. It seems that the BTC network is slowly adopting the Lightening network which should solve all the issues with the congestion like we saw back in 2017. Unfortunately, the adoption of the lightening network isn't moving along as fast as we would like to see it.

Don't take the chance IMO. Keep it on coinbase or convert to fiat if you think price will drop (if people lose their coins and panic).

2811,"I feel I have to weigh in here (with my limited knowledge, of course) because people seem to be making assumptions (that are not necessarily true) and giving advice based on those (which might be misguided).

**This is not your ""normal"" fork** (like BTC/BCH BCH/BTG,...):

  * there is no replay protection (this means most transaction will be valid on both chains)
  * there is no network separation (this means those tx valid on both chains will be broadcast to and likely mined on both chains)
  * there are no ""SV wallets"" and ""ABC wallets"" at this point because all parties plan to come out at top and noone builds separate wallet infrastructure

In other words: there will be 2 chains, but there will be a common transaction history. And it's possible that it is advantageous to have your coins on this common history and not on either one of the chains.

Why: because some services (like yours.org, memo.cash and others) have **decided to only accept non-split coins** (non-split = valid on both chains), so splitting your coins can actually be harmful.

Splitting might even happen accidentally: if someone sends you some dust (and this might be done en masse as a kind of attack) only valid on one chain and if your wallet uses that dust, your other coins will be ""poisoned"" by this and also be ""split"" and only be valid on that chain.

So my suggestion is: 
 
  * keep your coins in your own wallet where only *you* control they kes. If you keep them on an exchange that supports one of the forks and the other forks win, you lose.
  * don't split your coins for now unless you know exactly why you're doing it (and how to protect the part of your coins you don't want to split) and what the implications are

As this ""hash-war"" nears more and more hash power is being brought over to the BCH chain to be able to compete in the ""hash-war"".

Dr. Wright wins in this situation even if he is perceived as the losing party in the ""hash-war"" because the BCH chain gains more hash power everyday and co.'s like bitmain/btc.top etc. will continue to at minimum ""match"" hash power that is being brought onto the BCH chain via coingeek/nChain and co.

Draw them into a battle that requires those resources to ""fight"" and as that hashpower onboards onto the BCH chain companies like bitmain lose substantially as their business model requires them to mine the ""higher priced"" BTC but on the contrary bitmain and co. are only strengthening the coingeek/nChain ultimate goal of being the globally recognized Bitcoin.
