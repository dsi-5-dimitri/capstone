> “My expectation is that Casper will come first — possible next year, 2019,” said Drake. “Then in sharding we’ve actually broken it down into two big phases. Phase one is actually the data layer, so coming to consensus as to what data is in the shards. Phase two is all about the state, giving meaning to that data and the notion of transaction.”

8,"Are you wondering why Ethereum is losing value? This is because mass conciousness learns slower than individual conciousness.

What people are learning is the impact ASIC miners have on an already centralized coin. Didnt know this coin was already centralized? Did you know that Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum and the founders of ETC forked the blockchain to the new Ethereum and the majority of the community switched over? (It even kept the name)

That's right. The founders of Ethereum can change the protocol of the blockchain at any given time, making this as centralized as other coins like NEO.

The protocol of the blockchain is currently being changed by these founders to once again, benefit themselves. They are changing from PoW to PoS.

What does this mean? This means they are changing to an even more centralized cryptocurrency that ONLY benefits people who have a shit ton of ethereum (like the founders).

PoS is proof of stake and they are changing to it under the guise of becoming anti-asic which the founders said they didnt care about in early 2018. But now apparently they do, right around the time they are centralizing the coin by moving it to PoS.

What does this mean to the average Joe? This means you cant mine ethereum anymore. You can only buy it. And if you buy enough (the figure is really high) then you generate new Eth. So the people who will be generating the new Ethereum will be the ones who are holding the most Ethereum (the founders)

So since they possess the majority of existing ETH, then virtually ALL of the ethereum being generated in the future will be in their possession and they will sell it slowly to other people so they to can potentially have enough to generate new ETH.

This is by far the worst model for a cryptocurrency. The founders do the PoS to get people to buy more Ethereum from them (which gives the Ethereum they have more value). the incentive being you will make ""free"" ethereum by just holding a shit ton of ethereum. It tricks people into buying the centralized shit coin with the hope that they will get free money by just holding the coin.

Do you know what other crypto does this? NEO. Have you seen what has happened to the value of NEOs coin? $60 to $20 and now its stuck at $20... you notice what other coin is also have one of the worst declines? ETHEREUM.. because they are both centralized PoS coins with founders that are essentially the CEO of the coin. It completely defeats the purpose of crypto.

Remember at the start I said it takes the masses longer to learn than an individual. That is what is happening right now. That is what you are experiencing, a shift as people realize just how awful Ethereum truly is.

Monero will gain more attention in the close future. Why? they are anti-asic. If they ever change to PoS it will be a PoW/PoS hybrid. Also, the crypto is far more closer to anonymous than btc and ethereum. The cost is cheap to send monero and the speed is fast. This coin will start to gain more and more attention and value as people learn that the value of a coin lays within a blockchain, not in what the founders say they will or wont do in the future.",18-09-01-05-15,17,467,AfricanMonkeyGod,9bwikc,8,0.0,0.133,0.867,0.4304,114

Firstly, the interest rate for staking eth has not yet been firmly established, and what information we do have indicates that the higher the staking pool, the lower the interest paid in reward. This puts a firm brake on the centralizing of eth holdings (ie. whales getting fatter and fatter). Second, the vast majority of mining is noncompetitive unless you're in Iceland with cheap electricity, or you own a huge ASIC mine in china. This is clearly more centralised than anyone would like, and staking is available to anyone with a relatively small number of eth (currently floated at 32) and there will be staking pools for people who don't have enough but would still like to participate.

45,"Except that PoW leans towards centralisation over time too; early adopters in PoW tend to hold the largest stores too like in PoS.

If their chain is successful they simply have the resources to invest in mining equipment and establish a monopoly over hashrate centralising their network further like Bitmain which did exactly that when they built the XMR Asics last year establishing almost 86% of hashrate prior to the asic resistance fork (don't believe me look at the hashrate graphs).

The only difference is that the PoW chains waste a tonne of electricity to do so.

Monero doesn't do smartcontracts btw so it's basically just a currency which is presently mined mostly by botnets that illegally install themselves on other computers via malware to parasitcally mine on behalf of an oligarchy of self proclaimed 'cypherpunks' who in reality are little more than the equivalent of that kid who lives in their mom's basement until in their 50's.

Monero is also reliant on centralised services at present to be of any use; centralised exchanges for liquidity/fungibility and centralised websites for listings. We've seen most DNMs get taken down repeatedly and XMR getting lost/stolen in the process; sure it's got ringCT but its a bit useless really.

Social decentralisation is more important than physical decentralisation. Ethereum at present via its smartcontracts and dApps is building a service which is much more decentralised than monero which is at present incredibly niche and incredibly vulnerable.

Let me explain: I push that topic because I think Ethereum would have been further ahead in terms of development, and consequently adoption, if Afri and the others had to answer to a professional, skilled project manager that again reported to a board/foundation consisting of representatives from the four groups of the founder, users, ecosystem, and tokenholders. Hiring a world-class project manager and a communications expert would reduce chances of infighting, help devs not go off on tangents, synchronize their work better, reduce redundancy, and minimize duplicity in research efforts. The communications person would also minimize public relations missteps, prevent tweets like ""Not sure Ethereum will ever upgrade,"" ""Project X is everything Ethereum could have been,"" ""No Constantinople in 2018,"" etc.

I think the environment Ethereum is facing now is radically different from just two years ago, both from a competition and an ecosystem perspective. Ethereum must become more structured until 2.0/3.0 is out, if not, the product may be too late to the market (unless Vitalik ends up doing everything himself, Ethereum must make use of skilled project management and someone that can organize and hold the devs's feet to the fire, and prevent them from going off on these nonsensical tangents that have manifested the last six to eight months).

Identities could certainly be sold or traded away under this design. That might be an issue for some use cases. In the model of rough democratic governance I'm imagining, however, this would be a reasonable trade-off. I'm uncomfortable expecting too much oversight as this complicates the privacy of the system.

This is a legitimate social coordination obstacle in a global identity context. Perhaps a better way to frame this mechanism would be in terms of a regional or small world community setting. I'm uncertain whether the first issue couldn't be addressed by sharding the identity registry and allowing for cross-registry synchrony in some manner.

There also may be mechanisms to constrain these weaknesses. Making this an iterated game is one.

In this case, they would forfeit their identity claim for some duration. If there are multiple identity systems operating in parallel, they could register in a different community. Invalidating the entire system because a handful of identities are invalidated would seem to be a significant waste on at least utilitarian grounds.

>You can't take a solution predicated on ""a human must be playing"" to backstop ""my"" identity if there are billions of other humans somewhere else who might be playing on my behalf.

The mechanism merely aims to prove the uniqueness of some arbitrary set of sentient players. It offers no assurances about ""who"" those players are . As I said, I'm not claiming a perfect correspondence. That's a separate and unrelated problem. The idea here isn't so much about proving ""you"" are ""you"", but proving there are only so many unique players with access to private keys. This is why I call it a ""generic"" property.

>The worthiness of a goal does not make a flawed implementation any less flawed.

All blockchain-based identity schemes have their ""flaws"" (or limitations). Again, it's a question of trade-offs and what the particular use cases require of us. Being able to assert this generic property of ""humanness"" in a rough democratic system, for instance, would offer a more egalitarian and less invasive alternative to the various KYC-AML and coin-voting schemes. While some identities in the system may have been traded away that wouldn't suggest the vast majority of other participants are non-genuine. As I said, I would ""want to make the case""; I didn't say I provided a full-fledged argument. I admit this is more a thought experiment. There are many other nuances and implications to work out.

>Until then, the solution is broken, and exploitable, and provably so. So you can't just brush it away as an exercise for the reader to maybe solve one day \[...\] It's a theory, but it's not a very strong theory.

I think you're expecting a form of perfection that will render most solutions impractical. I'm basically just biting the bullet on your substitution objection and saying that we can still design some very interesting governance constructs regardless. I'm looking at this generic humanness as a system property; rather than as an individual property. Just because someone will trade away their identity, doesn't mean that everyone participating in the system will; especially not when you have other incentives or mechanisms constraining this behavior. I have yet to even explore all of these possibilities.

298,"**Panarchy**

Panarchy (from pan and archy), coined by Paul Emile de Puydt in 1860, is a form of governance that would encompass all others.  The Oxford English Dictionary lists the noun as ""chiefly poetic"" with the meaning ""a universal realm,"" citing an 1848 attestation by Philip James Bailey, ""the starry panarchy of space"". The adjective panarchic ""all-ruling"" has earlier attestations. In the twentieth century the term was re-coined separately by scholars in international relations to describe the notion of global governance and then by systems theorists to describe non-hierarchical organizing theories.

It is used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos using a machine learning technique called a ""generative adversarial network"" (GAN). The combination of the existing and source videos results in a fake video that shows a person or persons performing an action at an event that never occurred in reality.

Such fake videos can be created to, for example, show a person performing sex acts they never took part in, or can be used to alter the words or gestures a politician uses to make it look like that person said something they never did.

> None of these capabilities are feature-equivalent to create2, and in general cold wallets, HW wallets, light hardware, and L2 solutions such as state channels will benefit greatly from the advantages create2 provides, especially going forward into future versions of Ethereum.

Your [original claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aosaly/create2_eip_vulnerability_questions/egf4f3b/), the one I was contesting, was this:

> The broader issue is that an address isn't a commitment to any specific code. Sure, there are patterns you can use to produce these commitments in a stateful sense, but that just means anyone wanting to authenticate an address has to authenticate the whole state.

Which isn't exactly true.  An address *can* be a commitment to specific code, exactly in the same way `create2` creates an address that is a commitment for specific code.  The *only* difference is that you have to publish this commitment on-chain--which, presumably, is the ""stateful"" part of your claim.  I don't see how that's a problem--you can use that on-chain commitment as a convenient mechanism for ensuring the can be deployed by anyone, in the event of counterparty failure.  This is required even by `create2`, but harder to do in a trustless fashion.

Also, `create2` comes with the side effect of breaking the immutability of code invariant, which seems like a really steep price to pay for ""statelessness""... especially since it requires *even more* monitoring of state to avoid. It's also worth pointing out that `create2` only commits to bytecode, which makes verifying `init_code` an even harder task.  Changes in compiler optimizations, etc, can easily change the bytecode, making verification harder, especially in the use cases you seem to be advocating for (offline, hw wallets, etc).  You shouldn't ignore these side effects, nor should the burden of education around them be offloaded to ""the community"", as you seem in favor of doing.

In essence, you're privatising gains (enabling your specific use case), while socialising the losses (the burden of education and tooling).

>  None of these capabilities are feature-equivalent to create2

`create2` is, put simply, the commitment to specific code at a specific address.  The `Create2` contract I put forth in this article is exactly that: commitment to specific code at a specific address.  Again, the only difference is the lack of an on-chain commitment to that code.

> https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1095854769183358976

This misrepresents `create` in a bunch of ways, calls it bad for vague reasons that you never explain, and claims `create2` is the only way to solve all of these shortcomings--again, without really explaining what those shortcomings are.

> https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1096053407880806400

Hey wait a minute, isn't ""storage rent"" the very thing that opens the possibility of nonce reuse by EOAs?  You know, the thing that, when combined with `create2`, has the potential to bring back contracts created with `create` that had been selfdestructed?

Sia uses probabilistic methods to perform the proof of storage. When it's time to prove that the host still has the data, Sia requests a random 64 byte segment of the file.

If the host cannot produce the segment, then the host is penalized - they don't just not get paid, they also lose collateral that they posted.

allowing children to gamble is morally (and legally) wrong.  i don't know how you can think that its ok to allow that.

projects that allow gambling that don't use KYC are most likely illegal and the teams that operate them are anonymous.   the developers of those games risk prosecution and arrest if they offer their gaming to children, who should not be gambling, nor to some countries, where gambling is illegal.  you can't tell if the customer is a child or coming from an illegal country if you don't do kyc.

etheroll and sport crypt are using layer 1 and their gaming transactions are slow and cumbersome.   they 'work' and are doing well, but are not scalable to mass market use and are comparatively expensive - costing the user gas for each 'roll' or bet.

FunFair is built using a highly scalable and efficient layer 2 solution that is gas efficient and high performance.    for instance, FunFair can allow the customer to do more than a hundred dice rolls in the same time and cost as legacy apps can do just one dice roll and cost the customer a lot of gas.   but more importantly, the funfair tech can run more sophisticated and general apps and games, like blackjack, roulette, slot machines etc - that involve multi stage and multiple transactions per game.  something that could not efficiently be done on chain.   This allows the FunFair tech to compete against legacy online casinos that use centralised servers, which is the bulk of the online gaming market.

FunFair has built certain functionality into the FUN token that makes it well suited for gaming applications.

for example, two advanced features built into the FUN token are, 1. to assist in opening state channels quickly in one transaction including escrow deposits from both untrusted accounts of the player and casino, and 2.  FUN helps to protect the casino's bankroll from hackers or compromises to the private key.

neither of these functions are available directly with eth or dai or any existing token (unless the casino isn't fully trustless)

as for the friction of the player requiring to acquire FUN tokens before they can play, we have several ways to mitigate this friction.   The first is that we are comping the player their first FUN and Eth so they can try the games.  and we support dexs to acquire FUN tokens from eth in one click/tx for instance airswap and soon uniswap.   and a future version of our state channels could auto convert in and out to FUN tokens if that was deemed beneficial, so we do not believe there will be significant friction from our use of the FUN token in the future.",19-02-21-01-46,7,1048,JezSan,asp4b8,622,0.0,0.512,0.488,0.6369,23

EF must appoint a skilled project manager as soon as possible, show more discipline, and be more result-oriented.

For those of you that were naturally repulsed by the tonality of this letter, and outcomes, I would like to help you understand why, so that you may better teach others, by way of stories.

> others were more structured and disciplined

Many live a free life, and freedom to some means doing whatever you want - and some go on to extend this to mean 'without being judged'. There is an old story of a pupil who sought the affection of a master. This master, however, was frequently ill-tempered, prone to erratic moods. The pupil, having lived a pure life, was unable to identify the cause of these mood swings, and instead interpreted them as the natural, accepted behavior of adults in common - and went on to lash out using 'passive aggressive' or subversive tactics.

It wasn't till many years later that this pupil came to realize that the Lion had a slew of drugs injected into his system, leading to his bad behavior. His erratic and terrible deeds were the latent effects of drug abuse - his freedom to acquire a drug addiction impugned upon the pupils ability to develop, in good health. Should the Lion be judged?

Story 2:

Two boys enter into the woods, and come out bruised. One boy cries and cries and cries, the other boy goes back to work on the farm. Weeks go by, and while the other boy worked, the other worked on creating a campaign of pity, for it was well known that the farm boy was proud and quiet.

And as the sad boy went on retelling stories, creating illustrations, and adding to his rhetoric, he had gone so far as to say that this was not the case of two boys fighting in the woods, but a habitual problem of proud, quiet boys meeting and plotting - and engaging in racists behavior toward the lazy boys of the town.

And the quiet boy stayed quiet, until his home was burned.

Story 3:

People gathered around and a woman lied in the middle. ""Adulter, charlateen... naive!"" they cried, and worse, and killed her on the spot.

But then there was no bread, for she had made the bread, and her orphaned child was caught stealing a carrot - and slain. But then too, another townsperson, who relied upon the child for work missed his deadline, and he too was slain. His replacement was even less apt than the prior, the house he built fell - and he too was slain.

And around the circle it went until extinction, each one thinking themself better than those gone before.

Story 4:

Mother raises her child; she was a bad child, but she never abandoned her. In all times of strife, the mother showed only love and compassion - the traits we all hold dear.

Being of wealthy birth, the child went on to flaunt her destructive ways, abusing the servants and abusing herself. For her life was one of great ease, no challenge or accomplishment necessary whatsoever - all she had to do is live with the great wealth in which she was entrusted. However, a great wind blew and one day the world was reset - all houses were destroyed and all historic nobelity was lost.

But the servants, they showed her kindness. The people, they held no grudges. Still, as fortune would have it, she could not survive - for her mother had never taught her independence, and when it came time to suffer the long toil of work - she took her own life instead, with an expensive cocktail and bitterness upon her every breath, cursing her negligent mother.

---

For those of you who who have exhibited the stamina to avoid being wrangled into a racist tirade of bigotry: kudos. For your friends, you have a lot of work to accomplish, in so much as you have labored to earn their love.

Clear the body, and the head will follow. Good luck to the community as we seek to avoid destruction.

However, you (more so in the past, your posts/comments are much more reasonable now), Hudson, and Nick, keep fore-fronting the Internet mob narrative. I believe that is a deflection and not the issue here. There has not been offered a single piece of evidence that a major tokenholder has expressed any form of violent threats. And even in the event such evidence existed, the community at large has gone beyond themselves as a whole to thank Afri for his work and glorified his contribution, for the most part. That is what you should focus on, not on potential punks that exist everywhere. The evidence is therefore solid that up until now this argument has functioned as a strawman that serves to limit discussion of the real issues. This may be because some, not all, in the EF want to keep plugging along in their bubble and do not want change, and some perhaps  also fear scrutiny of their own roles in this. The main issue here is the structure and executional capability of the EF foundation, which world renowned venture capitalist and Ethereum investor Fred Wilson called ""lackadaisical."" If you care about your friend Afri, and want to understand what happened, you should consider that if the EF had been better structured and more responsible as well as responsive, Afri would still be part of the lead developers working for Ethereum. Afri is not the prime cause of the problems, his poor choice of actions at times are mostly just symptoms of the problems within the EF that were allowed to permeate the culture and express themselves in such unacceptable manners.

As it should be. Its an open source tech project. Could it use someone more business oriented in a role or two, maybe. Token holders IMO don't belong at the table though, because ETH isn't a security so you're not entitled to anything for holding it. And I say this as someone who's a programmer and holds ETH, but hasn't contributed to core code at all. If I want a say in the project, its my responsibility to contribute to it and then I can have my say, because that's how open source software works. If I don't bother contributing, then it would be ridiculous of me to bitch about not having a say, because why would l get one when I've added no value to the development of the project? 

The only thing stopping token holders from being heard (other than the fact they just hang out on Reddit and Twitter... which aren't the appropriate forums to get the attention of the team) is that they don't bother contributing, and if you can't contribute then put frankly, you get what you get. Not to mention if you're not contributing, your information is second hand at best and your opinion is 100% guaranteed to be missing critical details about the inner-workings of the project. You can't know what you don't know, and if you're not a dev there's a whole world of shit you don't know, since even as a programmer I know there's world of shit _I_ don't know, which is why its important that the devs who do know dictate direction. Mobs are irrational, uninformed, and will always end up creating a bloated, broken project in the end if you give their opinion more weight than it deserves. Opening the project up to [design by committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee) is a sure fire way to put it on the fast track to self destruction. 

I get that token holders want a say, and token holders feel like they're super smart and understand everything perfectly. But even if you're one of the few non-contributing token holders who does actually understand the inner workings of the project in incredibly granular detail, keep in mind there's 100 other morons who would also be entitled to an opinion just because they bought a token... it's a bad move and if the EF entertains the idea I'm switching to a competing chain because the writing will be on the wall.

Well, here we are. 2 years later. 

The moment arrived that he needed the community's support. But there were not enough supporters left.

That's what happens when you kick people left and right in an arrogant, shortsighted, disrespectful manner.

Someone here reminded me of the Taylor situation, where she was also getting attacked, and how that time was different. Because of her friendly and respectful behavior in the weeks, months, years before, she got the community support she needed in those hard times, and she survived it.

Afri learned the hard way that, in the end, human decency is a fundamental skill as well: the people you kicked today, might have been the ones who would've defended you tomorrow.

I just had a discussion today with one of the Ethereum moderators who defended his behavior 2 years ago, and it's sad to see that this message is still not coming across. 

Moderating a community, keeping the group together and keeping everyone happy, requires different skills than programming. 

Today we've paid the price for this as a community, by losing a skillful developer like Afri who's work I highly respect.

Let us be reminded, that a vocal minority has attacked Afri and it's effectively the lack of a defending majority that has taken perception out of balance.  But I do believe that this silent supportive majority is out there.

It's a mistake to believe this incident would be a fair representation of the relation between the devs and the community.

My recommendation would be for the members of the Ethereum foundation (who are active on Reddit), to increase their community staff here to more acceptable levels to relieve the workload of the main crew, an additional staff that can help to try creating a more positive open community as we grow.

It makes some references to r/ethtrader, and some of the discussion which occurred here.

What I am more concerned about is where do we go from here.

I understand the difficult position the devs feel they are in.  I also hope they realize that much of the damage here was hopefully a somewhat isolated incident (given some of the ""colorful"" forms of engagement which Afri chose which I have not seen any other prominent dev engage in).  That is not an excuse for those who took up arms against him, but it is an observation that I doubt we will see similar issues of equal severity in the near future.  Still, it doesn't mean it couldn't happen, hence the possible applicability this concerned letter.  As someone who has been attacked here personally, I can sympathize to a degree.

I'm happy to hear the devs express their concerns, and work productively with them as **one community** to address intolerance.  Not as two communities, with one thinking of the other in a consistently pejorative manner, questioning their value to the ecosystem.  But honestly, moving on from today, I'd prefer not to blow that ""intolerance"" out of proportion any further.

To those devs, I'd only say this: know that there are forces that operate in this r/ethtrader that none of us can control at times.  They include paid actors, and others who would seek to sow division in our community. Come down on us hard, tell us we're all terrible people over and over again, malign an entire sub of 200K people of guilt and culpability, and you're only playing into their hands by radicalizing fringe elements of this community, or providing a narrative for those malicious actors who seek that radicalization.  Work with us, and participate as community members, and they won't have a leg to stand upon in the future.

Some perspective: while Lane Rettig proposed to increase diversity in this Medium post: https://medium.com/@lrettig/how-open-is-too-open-bfc412cf0d24, his vision of ""diversity"" is a head count of the melanin on display. More black? Good, regardless if it's upper class from Manhattan. More white? Bad, regardless if it's lower class from Poland.


These racialized views of individuals, with the frankly disgusting ""person of color"" moniker, might be (unfortunately) valid in the ivory tower subconscious of the American upper middle class. But Ethereum claims to be a world project, and amongst a worldwide community, you are bound to find reactions rejecting American imperialism, in ideology as in everything else.


As for Taylor Monahan, her original move to launch MyCrypto was rather... unconventional: she took the MyEtherWallet twitter account and its thousands of followers, and changed it overnight, on the basis she felt a personal connection to this account. The entitlement didn't play well with the community, who felt the other half of MyEtherWallet, Kosala Hemachandra, was unfairly treated (and indeed, is ""nonpersoned"" in this document). Later, lawsuits dating back months between the two, involving money, more money and VC money, led to more inflammatory responses to the public front of innocence.


(Taylor has since apologized to the community, and the Twitter account was given back. Lane has made no comments.)


Let's consider the so-called campaign of hate. One moment the dissenting voices are ""a vocal minority""; the next second, the community must not fall prey to ""mob rule"".

Yes there needs to be a healthy and open exchange of ideas for you to see success, but core players/devs can no longer be careless in what they say or how they say it because Ethereum is now a massive ecosystem with billions of dollars attached to it. You have more responsibility to uphold this principle than random internet commentators, you should be held to a higher standard.

I begged them to reconsider alienating the community and still ask them to reconsider their stance, some of the comments before the document was sanitised were quite disturbing in terms of the group think and dev vs pleb narrative (there was also members questioning the use of this document). This was written before the productive discussions today and I really don't want that to be derailed. The current version has been softened which I'm glad.

I still hope they reconsider this stance and realise this isn't actually addressing the core issues. I ask everyone to please keep a level head around this, be respectful in the discussions to come.

For all the references to 'free speech' and allowance for dissenting opinions, it sure seems like only 'approved speech' and dissenting opinions *by certain parties* should be permitted, going forward.

I legitimately wonder how I'm supposed to raise a concern in the future, if I want to question the content of any public communication made by a core dev.  What if my 'honest' and 'well-thought out' question triggers a mob response?  Should I just not ask it then?  Should I ignore potential conflicts of interest and hope everything works out for the best? What are the appropriate avenues for raising an issue?  Are certain contributors beyond reproach, and just not responsible for their words and actions in any capacity?  Does the threat of 'verbal violence' necessitate stifling the potential for valid discourse?  These are not meant as rhetorical questions, they're ones I'd honestly like to hear answers to.

I first learned about Ethereum due to a random news article about the DAO.  I spent a month and a half doing research and watching how that drama played out.  When all was said and done, I was impressed -- convinced enough by what I saw, I took a huge risk and invested much more than I could afford to lose in the protocol (I got lucky with the bull run, and have since diversified my holdings much more sanely).  I liked the way that things were handled, and I saw the promise and potential of Ethereum, both the software and the community.  Despite the delays in getting proof-of-stake and sharding released, I remained a steadfast proponent of Ethereum, convinced that there were complex engineering problems which were taking longer to solve.

These days, I'm not so convinced the main issues are technical, and for the first time since then, I'm actually really worried about Ethereum's future.

To be perfectly blunt, Ethereum is going to be superseded if it doesn't get its shit together soon.  All the hard work the devs have done and will continue to do won't matter in the least if we can't all pull together and find a better form of governance, and a stronger management structure.  Dfinity or whoever else is going release a functional product, far superior to Ethereum, with an engaged group of high-level executives who are able to properly communicate with the masses, and navigate the sometimes-uncomfortable world of being a public figure.  Seemingly, this will be a day to celebrate for many of the devs, who aren't concerned about foolishness like 'maximalism' and apparently they will cheer on the success of their peers, while the code into which they've put their blood, sweat, and tears lies fallow and unused.

# Rage Against the (Ethereum Virtual) Machine

## Disclaimer: as in our usual provocative style, the title of the article intends to explain the byproduct of the events unfolded this weekend, in a light-hearted manner. 

The Department of Decentralization was created to push open source development, the people behind it, and to grow awareness by educating the community. These past days, one of our collaborators, friends, and the catalyzer of the Görli Testnet, Afri, has been in the eye of the storm of an uncontrollable angry mob, that, triggered by a couple of tweets, turned menacing, dark and most importantly, reflected everything that as a community, we should avoid.

DoD categorically rejects these actions. Even though we understand the nature of Afri’s tweets have been a bit triggering, these opinions were personal and any threats against a person’s well-being shall never be justified. The stream of reactions, ranging from personal threats to demands, unrealistic conspiracy theories, etc.. We believe Ethereum community is a progressive community, that values freedom, free speech, privacy but humanity and better systems above all.  

DoD does not have a significant investment on ETH, or any coin. We help developers build better tools. It is then, our responsibility, to protect our own and to preserve the existence of the Görli testnet. 

Now to how this might affect Ethereum. The network is built, maintained and scaled by HUMANS. These humans are not on 24/7 call, they are entitled to their opinions, and any means they want to express them in. This hate campaign has upset some of the minds behind the project, and hurt a lot of contributors, whether developers or not. 

Now to the angry mob: how do you expect us to move past this, as humans? Don’t you realize how much this intimidates us? The voices behind Ethereum have voiced their thoughts. We still need more, of course.

But people mass downvote them on Reddit and refuse to accept that we reject this mob mentality.",19-02-20-13-14,0,47,terrific_terry,asilyv,839,0.13,0.0,0.87,-0.34,96

I would want to, but the problem is that the main case that I was personally involved in, was played out mainly in a private moderation conversations with the Ethereum moderation team. ( https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/79dqxt the team can access it though) 

That is the problem with these cases, they all play out in private conversations:

* first it starts with a ban or censor, these events are hidden from view, nobody gets to see them except the ones personally involved (the ones who received a ban)

* and secondly, ""how things are treated furtherly"", also happens in private conversations, which we also don't have access to.

And it's not the banning (the first part) that makes the difference. It's the second part. How a person gets treated after a ban: 

*Does he get a chance to defend himself? Does he get threatened with a longer ban? Or does he get ignored entirely?* **Overall, does he get respected as a conscious human adult?**

This latter part, is where Afri absolutely failed. Probably also on the first part, but most definitely on the second part.

I can confirm this from personal experience, and judging by testimonies I've read in the past over a period of 2 years.

I mean,

I personally probably would have defended him instead of abstaining. If there was a positive memory. 

When Taylor was attacked, I jumped on it to cover for her because I was reminded of my positive encounters with here and you want to give something back for that.

When Afri was attacked however, I had a ""I don't care"" attitude and I didn't participate in the conversation (nor in an attack nor in his defense). It's because I was not reminded of any positive encounters with him. 

This applies to everyone.

I've been on a dozen different development teams and the one consistent thing of them all is that no matter how ready you think you are, no matter how well you bug test everything, no matter how seasoned the team is, there are always, without fail, unexpected bugs that pop up that no one considered when we launched the product.

So, shouldn't there be some kind of safety precautions? Shouldn't there be some kind of warnings, preventative measures? Maybe a cap that is determined by the going market value at the time that can be queried?

I just feel like this is a recipe for disaster and as a developer myself, not knowing enough about how these things works, kills any motivation I have to develop myself. This is a ticking time bomb, imo. Seems too risky.

EDIT: I am only saying this as a bit of an *outsider* looking in, and I am just trying to say that this is the type of negative media that hurts growth potential, imo. I think that even though it is likely fool-proof, to an extent, the fact that it is even possible just sounds worrisome. I am here because of all the crap out there, Ethereum seems to be one of the most legit in what it is trying to accomplish rather than just be another hype coin for the speculators.",19-02-20-09-42,1,15331,GeneticsGuy,asgh0t,921,0.0,0.574,0.426,0.4019,136

In the example you gave, the goal would be for a transaction to use the _maximum_ gas if mined by the intended miner, or else use the _minimum_ gas.

In order to execute the code you included, a contract would need to be deployed, which has a minimum gas cost of 32,000. The current block gas limit is about 8,000,000 gas, so that would be the maximum gas used.

Brave Browser/BAT is getting a lot of attention, but I am very picky in my Browser environment and customize a lot, and don't see any reason to use it. If it was a Firefox extension and provided any value, then maybe. 

I do love the concept of dApps though. Instead of embedding annoying Advertisement in websites, they can get paid directly and instantly for anything. That's a good solution.

SAN DIEGO--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[**XYO**](https://xyo.network/in-the-news/?utm_source=MOBI&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_campaign=MOBI&utm_term=News&utm_content=MOBI&utm_admix=LS&utm_mediatype=Earned&utm_reality=Virtual&utm_sense=Sight), the technology that bridges blockchain to the physical world, is proud to announce it has won the MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) Grand Challenge “People’s Choice” award. XYO is a member of MOBI, and a peer alongside global leaders including BMW, IBM, General Motors and Ford. The award was presented to the XYO team on February 15th, at the culmination of the first MOBI Grand Challenge Hackathon at the headquarters of MOBI community member BMW Group in Munich, Germany.

The MOBI award for XYO specifically commends the company’s contributions to the creation of a viable, decentralized, mobile ad-hoc network of blockchain / distributed ledger technology (DLT) connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that can reliably share data, coordinate behavior, and ultimately improve human mobility and quality of life.

Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder and Head of Operations commented on the win: “We are ‘over the moon’ at winning this award, and also by the strong showing of support the community has shown for our project and technology. With blockchain we can significantly improve the interconnectivity and usefulness of data between today’s smart devices and vehicles, and we’ll use this award to push the boundaries of what’s possible as we build out the ‘Internet-of-All-Things’ and a more connected world.”",19-02-21-07-40,2,395,frankie_mastro,astf7t,1051,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1

- has its precise lat,lng saved on its SDCARD and *nowhere else*

Exodus of several developers has been seen before in Bitcoin but for the better, surprisingly.

However, the main problem as I see it is a holdover from the OSS movement of the 90s and early naughts:  how does one monetize Open Source Software?  There's two fundamental ways:  have it run on specialized locked-down hardware, such as Google did with Android.  This for-profit company then hires developers as needed.  The blockchain route is to ""tokenize"" development.  In other words, developers sell a white paper using magic internet money as the receipt for investors.  The problem with the latter is there's no sense of urgency to development let alone actual deployment, so you have deployment being put on hiatus for months at a time for holidays.  I'm still skeptical that Constantinople will actually be deployed this February 28, being National Pokemon Day and all....

Afri Schoedon, and many of the others are stated followers of Chaos philosophy and this has shone through the project, unfortunately.

> The psychological impact of waking up every day to multiple people commenting about your shortcomings can't be overstated.

It most certainly can be overstated, and is overstated, by anyone who does not understand that external criticism has no inherent impact on our inner peace. Any negative internal impact of external criticism is simply the result of not being a resilient individual, at least in the context of receiving criticism.

""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" - Aristotle

We allow things to bother us. We permit ourselves to be affected or offended by the mere words of others. This happens due to our own insecurities regarding what it means to live a good life. According to Stoicism, one only needs to ensure that we pursue virtue, so as to not betray our own internal probity, in order to live a good life. Stoicism is arguably the most tangible and useful philosophy for those in positions such as global leaders and anyone who is in a position that exposes their being to a myriad of public criticism. This has been proven by the likes of Marcus Aurelius, who was the closest embodiment in history to Plato's ""Philosopher King"", this man received criticism and endured hardship to a degree that makes Afri's twitter critisim appear to be a form of flattery, relatively speaking. Yet Marcus Aurelius was able to endure such experiences without betraying himself or his people, due to his philosophical foundation. I understand that I am likely to receive downvotes for saying this, but I feel that the decentralisation movement as a whole has made a mistake by making the technical side of the movement the cornerstone/foundation of the movement itself (it is literally why we have core members unable to handle some internet flak). I believe that philosophy is the only viable paradigm that can form the foundation of any movement hoping to reach its full potential.

If you have not read [The Enchiridion by Epictetus](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), or [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf), I highly recommend doing so.

""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful,
arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil.

And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural.

An open source project handles a lot of stuff quite different than a megacorp or the US military. Everything happens out in the open and everyone can see everything. Discussions that normally would happen behind closed doors in companies (like what the competitors do better than we do) are put out into the public eye. This has the advantage that you can accumulate many different viewpoints from insiders, users, developers and outsiders. At the same time you loose the ability to hold many secrets.  


One important part of why open source works is because everyone that does not agree with something can criticize  a project, send a patch and if after some time there is no consensus a fork happens.

1319,"I don't see the harm in having a slew of people from the community, frankly. The group-think is the issue here.

The other issue is resistance to documentation, and argument in the written form. It's *very* telling that no votes are recorded, members aren't listed, and qualification of membership isn't stated. These 'Dev Calls' are the EU of leadership - and naturally their authoritarian nature creates resentment.

How is it possible to have anyone referred to as a 'core dev' that is not also 'the community'? How is it possible that the selection process routinely lands on the same small group of people, who generically begin the 'open discussion' in total agreement?

I have a process for Open Governance that I believe will scale extremely well. However, it, by nature, requires the removal of entrenched bureaucracy and dictators.

It is quite simple:

8 persons meet. 2 groups of 3 are chosen, from which 2 people are nominated as representatives.

These 2 reps meet with 6 others... forming a new group of 8.

This can scale quite well, but for the purposes of Ethereum, all one would need is 32 willing participants. That is not a big ask. I suspect you'd find 128 willing participants after just one month.

It is the governmental process I hope to see for an Open and inclusive world. If you want to know more, just ask and I'd be happy to share, as I've consistently demonstrated.

Accordingly, proper discipline of your cognitive responses should lead rather directly to your emotional state; and therefore your peace of mind is, in a deeper sense, a personal choice.

""If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad."" For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy. Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine stolen? Say to yourself, ""This is the price paid for equanimity, for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing."" When you call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power to give you any disturbance."" - The Enchiridion, Epictetus

""If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don't wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity neglect the other."" - The Enchiridion, Epictetus

""If you have an earnest desire of attaining to philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to be laughed at, to be sneered by the multitude, to hear them say,."" He is returned to us a philosopher all at once,"" and "" Whence this supercilious look?"" Now, for your part, don't have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you as one appointed by God to this station. For remember that, if you adhere to the same point, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule."" - The Enchiridion, Epictetus

""Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself."" - The Enchiridion, Epictetus

""People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony."" - Meditations, Marcus Aurelius

If I was to summarize for this purpose it would be this:

People gather in groups of 8, elect 2 representatives (as mentioned), forming new groups of 8.

A 'final table' of 8 is created, which we can call 'the leaders'. Their objective is to Criticize and Direct, not to execute. In effect, they have no power, beyond the power of media attention.

These 8 join with 24 others from prior elections, forming a group of 32... 8 rotated in / out per cycle. The responsibility of these 32 is to ensure the wishes of the masses are enforced (signing checks, primarily).

Checks are issued in a 'direct democracy' system, for 2 purposes: to reward individuals and to reward groups. Tables vote on select individuals to reward (such as developers) and select groups (such as Parity, et al). In the full system, 32 individuals would win per cycle (paid equally) and 8 groups.

In addition to the 'direct democracy' aspects, there is also representative democracy in which the Representatives are awarded - however generally the Table from which Reps were selected are rewarded, rather than the individual, to foster community support.

Lastly, the leaders write 8 anonymous criticisms, and payouts are issued to the paper, not the individual (such as to an ETH address), and the 32 'prior leaders' plus some others issue a document of guidance toward the future - which you can think of as a 'road map'.

After the election process, everything disbands until next round.

A big difference in this system vs others is that 1) in order to vote, you must commit to a 1 hour discussion, and 2) you are essentially paid to vote vs losing time for nothing.

This is the end goal, but I'm still working on implementing it in it's entirety. I'm still researching how to host mutable content using IPFS.

I've been thinking about the best way to handle this. To me, this seems like a problem with supply and demand, but using non-fungible tokens, it is possible to have multiple copies of the same book that can be checkout to separate people. Although this won't solve the problem, I'm hoping it will be ok in the early stage, to have enough copies to adequately supply a small initial amount of users.

1711,"They are really similar in some ways. In my mind they are like retail chains where each shard/parachain is an individual store. 

Ethereum Serenity is more like a chain where every store needs to have the same interior, menu and staff guide lines. Everyone is aligned with the same company share value. Creating a new store here is almost as simple as one click.

Polkadot is more like a membership where you can get shared benefits and insurance, but each store is free to follow their own rules. They do however provide a bootstrap mechanism ('Substrate') to create your own store. 

- The beacon chain finality is Casper FFG with LMD Ghost which most people here know by now. 
- The Polkadot chain finality seems like a [TheDAO style](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/polkadot-governance-8d81e91ea975) proposal/voting round with possibility to veto.

Ethereum keeps it simple by keeping the design of all shards similar. Polkadot keeps it simple by not trying to micromanage each 'shard'... It would even allow the Ethereum beacon chain as a member.

This whole thing was an ugly mess, I wish it didn't happen but it did. However I do feel there was some legitimate concerns during this event. I have touched on a bit here with this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arr7c6/leadership_should_be_held_accountable_to_the/egpzi9s) in response to [mariapaulafn](https://www.reddit.com/user/mariapaulafn) request for input around integrity (which I have replied in the form). It incited the worst of the community and I don't think many devs response was exactly professional in many cases calling out the ethereum community as a whole as being the problem (this was partially self inflicted on Afri's behalf - not excusing the rubbish hurled at him), rather deciding to focus on the fringe nut cases is not useful discourse (this however is!).

I feel there has been a schism for some time forming between parts of the community and devs particularly since EIP 999 etc and lack of real statement from Parity around it's intentions of recovering those funds regardless of what the community thinks (community has to be on the lookout for hidden changes snuck in) is a sore point and I think is mostly the origin for the question of conflict of interest.

That being many in the community saw it as a bail out for people who were close to core devs, where is the line in the sand drawn? Countless people have lost ETH over the years for countless reasons why does Parity get special treatment? This has festered for some time and it seems the tweet was the catalyst for this to blow up (and some of the more insane theories to surface).

A quick reminder just playing devils advocate here on what I've observed.

I believe that Ethereum contributors deserve the right to work in a non hostile environment, not sure how we can provide that online because internet.

I believe providing some COI statements would help eliminate some ""social attack vectors"". When there is doubt that is where the actual trolls get ammunition from.

Basically how do you see that the community could move on from this very ugly chapter? Is there a need for some sort of professional conduct in regards to social media eg. how does the average community member feel about this? how can I present this in a non-inflammatory way? Discussing ideas is fine but tact is required. How to deal with fallout? This AMA is a good step.

Whether Afri is a bad player or not, this has highlighted an area that we need to work on as a community.

People might find it funny that I mention this, but an added problem is the artificial over-civilization of internet communities nowadays. I'll try to explain that one.

What types of dicussion? These friendly but passive-aggressive requests and talking about ""accountability"" and bringing up conspiracy theories and shit like that, basically stuff you can't get banned for.

Because everyone is voicing their anger with kind words, these sentences read as very intelligent criticism regardless of its content, and people start upvoting just because it sounds good.

**Result:** The development team reads this stuff and the upvotes it has received, and they'll **get the feeling** the entire community is against them causing an escalation of the situation to be not too far off ( ea. Afri going offline).


So I'd say: Stop it guys. Stop this nonsense. 

# Accountability

Let's not over-complicate things and let's not get into this trap of over-governance and provable accountability and all of that bs.

Ethereum developers really shouldn't have to devote so much of their time to deal with all of this bullshit.

This is what you get with this whole over-civilization of the internet, and the concern-trolling that forms as a result.


# Democratization

**Please let's not fall into this trap of democratizing the entire code development process.** Sometimes technical decisions have to be made that are hard to understand for the general public, but necessary to progress and to complete the bigger picture.

We should not expect from the developers having to explain every single line of code or coding decisions to the entire internet. Internally is enough. 

**Or more worringly, developers could get concerned that an idea they have could be perceived as controversial by the community leading to self-censorship.**

Developers, and Ethereum, need the freedom of thought which is required in these kind of projects.

We should be able to put our trust on the Ethereum development team to do the right thing. 

# Trust

And the Ethereum development team should be wise enough (**without** enforced artificial boundaries, limits, administration) to not misuse our trust.

**Please**, let's not start nor support a whole governance or administration machine that in the end will only slow down progress, and harm innovation.

I support the Ethereum team fully and I trust in them doing the right thing at all times.

1792,"Hey everyone. 

Firstly I'd just like to thank the Devs for all you do. Public figures get so much BS in this field that I have a lot of respect for the thick skin required to be in this position. 

Secondly, I would like to echo several posts here by people like DCinvestor who disagree with the behaviour displayed over the past few days. I had made several posts calling people to chill out and take a deep breath over this issue and I know I was not alone. 

Lastly, I want to apologize to Afri and talk about what I believe led to the issues we've been having the past couple days. 

I believe the biggest problem we have is the lack of good faith and respect we have for those deeply involved in Ethereum. The reality is that Afri has been a longstanding member of the community, and for those who actually know him, have full faith that he is not a bad actor acting out of malice.

Those that were so quick to condemn him for sneaking in EIPs to recover the Parity multi-sig, intentionally delaying the HF, working as a 'double-agent' etc. offered 0 benefit of the doubt to a member of the community who has worked hard and who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

Part of this is ascribed to ignorance. If you only see the bad things, are detached and removed from the on the ground reality (which the internet makes very easy) then you are far less likely to have compassion and understand the critical nuance and context of the situation.

If people had brought up concerns about Afri's conflict of interest without immediately ascribing blame and getting the pitch forks out right away that would have gone a long way to diffusing the situation and having a much healthier outcome. Instead, people rushed to presume guilt and malice and that doesn't leave room for a healthy discussion of any possible issues.

We absolutely cannot be so quick to condemn, based on a partial understanding of facts. This is something we cannot tolerate and is a problem in the greater internet culture in general with echo chambers that can leave us feeling emboldened in our positions. 

I hope that in the future, we are able to call a quorum in the community to discuss the issues in a calm manner without resorting to hasty judgments and possibly even worse behaviour.

Thank you to everyone in the Ethereum community that makes it such a reasonable, warm, and kind place.

1796,"Thanks for doing this. I may be late, and this is more a suggestion than a question, but here you go. I think that the sort of ethical considerations like issues of conflict of interest are thorny enough in well-defined and established genres of human action and production like science, business or politics - how to best deal with them within a high-stakes decentralized innovative crypto-economic open source IT-infrastructure project is a question that nobody has answered yet. Nobody has come even close. So in my book this follows:

\- Let us not forget what this project is not: it is not a business or an established constitutional representative democracy. Expectations and intuitions about what is acceptable and desirable will vary. Screw-ups are to be expected even with the best intentions.

\- Let us try to stay civil. 

\- Let us try to work this out as we go along. 

In the spirit of the last item, I suggest the following: in the next round of grant calls, EF should allocate some money (and, what costs way more, donate some of the top devs time for in-depth interviews) to hire teams of outside ethicists+IT&complience experts (preferably from academia  and preferably already with an understanding of the crypto scene) to do an audit of the accountability of the key participants of the Ethereum project (this could involve all sorts of people, even sub-reddit cheerleaders :-)) and make recommendations.

L.E: Other important things concern me, from which some I already speak out in other posts:

1. What is the ""official"" way to get information about Ethereum? All communications channels used till now are hard to track (especially twitter) and/or full of trolls spreading misinformation either on purpose or lack of understanding
2. Should Ethereum have a PR/communication agency so we don't rely on crypto twitter?
3. [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) as well as [https://ethereum.org/foundation](https://ethereum.org/foundation) don't provide enough information, there are 3 members listed and no way to get in touch with them. (I remember during ETH 2.0 AMA I wanted to shout out to ETH Foundation security lead and couldn't find him...I don't know who the members and their responsibilities are)
4. Regarding ETH Core Dev's and Constantinople, how was ChainSecurity supposed to get in touch with Ethereum? I remember they discovered that earlier. Is it by twitter? If so, to whom? A tweet can be easily ignored. Shouldn't [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) provide the information to report a bug or any other idea?
5. On behalf of Afri who has become the target of some trolls, [why did he needed to be the one to dispel the Ethereum chain size reaching 1TB all alone](https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a)? If it wasn't for him and I wouldn't have run a node myself, how can you dispel the constant FUD against Ethereum, if you have nobody to officially be in charge of such things? Quote from his text: "" *I have been running Parity in 36 different configurations over six weeks to gather the numbers.* ""  (<- Is this what somebody who is against ETH will do with his free time?)
6. Reg the nodes prepared for Constantinople fork, remember all the misinformation again? [Here it is](https://coinrivet.com/latest-under-half-of-ethereum-nodes-are-ready-for-the-constantinople-upgrade/), but also all over reddit, all over crypto media and crypto twitter. Wondering if maybe ETH Fundation should have an official and public way to track it and show the status to everybody? (note: the scrappers on [https://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview](https://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview) were gathering data from nodes which were not running ETH mainnet, so they didn't need to upgrade.

By the way, that's what the recent EIP process had been.

Put out EIP B, present it at conferences, hold coin-votes, fail. Gauge the community on an appropriate path, try route C, defend selves on twitter, fail...

I think that this point is subtle and more accurate than people could know.  When there aren't mechanisms for productive engagement with key community members on Reddit, the discussion will head in the direction it heads.  Even people like me, who post on Reddit often, are powerless to stop harmful narratives- even if I make post after post discouraging them.

The only counter to them are the voices of prominent community members, many of whom have now eschewed Reddit as a toxic cess pool, and speak often on Twitter of their revulsion towards it.

What we must all understand is that a conversation will happen here whether you like it or not- is it better to be a part of that conversation?  Or to watch it play out and speak disparagingly of entire communities on Twitter?

1821,"Speaking as myself (heyo), this is one that feels cut and dry but sometimes just isn't. We work in a new space where things are about openness and sharing ideas. To that end, the amount of overlap between friendly projects, ideas, staff, devs research and implementations is both expected and incredible.

&#x200B;

This includes well known examples of major dApp teams sharing advisors with ETH Core-Devs, side projects like how [Slock.it](https://Slock.it)'s early work shifted into the DAO or endless later examples of staff or devs spanning projects with similar ideas/researchers that contribute in multiple areas. Even many ops staffers all know each other and might've worked for a few groups.

&#x200B;

Vitalik tweeted a few weeks back hoping that ETH community members wouldn't treat new/legitimate projects like some BTCers treated the Ethereum space.

&#x200B;

So where is the line? For example -- let's look at two types of ""competing projects"".

&#x200B;

1. The friendly group: While they're working on a non-ETH project, a dApp, OR even one that could bridge ETH or have dApp teams try L1 solutions, they're part of this community. A group like Cosmos had OmiseGO and others ready to try out Tendermint at launch, wanted to bridge ETH, AND sponsors Devcon! They bring their whole staff and work to exchange ideas. THAT is what this community was, is, and should be about. When I was at Web3 Summit this year, many of us learned that a prominent member of their community was advising Web3/Polkadot. We can't excommunicate every good dApp, dev, or anyone else that wants to collaborate or that isn't religiously in one camp when dealing with good actors who want to experiment in new ways. Let's just be better tech. So is this the line?
2. The unfriendly group: If a group is hostile to the greater crypto community, or known for trying to buy dev teams or sign exclusivity deals.

A.) I think they would hopefully be pressured by the community to explain themselves.
B.) There's a balance that needs to be struck when dealing with communication from core devs and the community. Over communication slows development and can send unnecessary controversy when things are taken out of context from those who aren't use to speaking to wider audiences. I prefer that there be more communication from liasons to the core devs who can properly translate their highly technical.work into something the wider community can digest (this happens already with some of the newsletters and blog posts that get produced).

1834,"Thanks for the question. My perspective is that the difficulty bomb forces both devs to upgrade the software and for miners to go along with the forks or risk. Whether or not that is a perfect solution I'm not sure.

They believe (rightly so) that many would choose not to ""upgrade"" if not forced to do so. In other words its like a disease that only a hard fork can cure.

Even though it is a powerful tool to force miners and other stakeholders to act against their own interest (at least in the short term), it creates a lot of pressure to get those upgrades out before everything falls apart. Right now Ethereum is slowing down considerably, and god forbid there is another show stopping last minute bug in the fork its only going to get worse and worse. Despite the power it gives them to enforce their vision, the downsides of this gun to the head of Ethereum is starting to become more and more apparent to developers, stakeholders and community members.

Personally I think it's borderline ridiculous to build such fragility into a decentralized system, when the entire point of decentralization is to reduce failure points. But removing it would be accepting a world where miners would play a much larger role and given that ETH 2.0 is a system where miners basically don't exist, it's a guaranteed stalemate and/or schism along those lines.

1837,"I think both issuance reduction and ProgPoW are very political as well as technical. Both of them are nuanced in different ways. In each case it appears that the core devs are forced to make a final call on these things because there are not other structures set up to decide on controversial decisions that are not purely technical. Additionally the core devs make the code and have to make judgements on what's best for the ecosystem and what the community wants.

For issuance reduction it came down to this: efforts were made to reach out to different stakeholders in the community including small miners, mining pools, investors, and developers so everyone could be heard. I individually reached out to dozens of individuals and held a core dev call with about 30 people from across the different viewpoints to give their views. You can view the meeting video and read the notes to see which stakeholders were present - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2045.md
After hearing all of the viewpoints and waiting around a month to aggregate signals from the community the core devs came to a decision based on what they thought the community wanted. See video of core dev call where the decision was made - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/55

For ProgPoW it is more difficult. This is arguably a bigger change that takes a longer time to gather data, research, develop a spec, code, engage the community, gather signals, and make a decision. The reason it is taking longer is due to higher complexity and being very safe in making sure it won't break things. ProgPoW is much more than just technical because it relies on the assumption that ASICs should be kicked off the network due to risk of centralization.

I know that the devs have the hardest job.  I recognize you're the ones doing the ACTUAL work and putting in the time to build the protocol into what it is and what it will become.  I have in the past (and will continue in the future) to defend the devs against the ethtrader hoards who seem to endlessly complain that other people aren't doing enough work to make them money faster.

I think it's great that the devs meet frequently, collaborate with other projects, go out for drinks and get to know each other personally -- it sounds like a great way to deepen trust and build community.  But the larger Ethereum community is much more than this.  There are plenty of people who are equally (if not more) invested in the outcome of the protocol who simply can't attend all the conferences, and therefore miss the ability to make these networking connections, and get to know other contributors on a personal level.  However, your words make it sound like these people are second-class citizens.  We get stuffed in coach while the devs all mingle up in first class/hang out at a ski retreat.

Obviously, there needs to be some form of meritocracy -- people who can't write code shouldn't insist on contributing code.  And code is obviously what fuels this whole endeavour.

I will give you one simple example of a small detail that caught my attention. Months ago, it was decided in the lead developers meeting that Progpow  should not be discussed there, because it was not the right forum (perfectly understandable and a smart decision). Still, in the second to last developers meeting, Progpow was not only brought up, but it was the only issue discussed (and no conclusion was reached, it was decided to deal with it later). Is this good project management? (the issue I'm raising is project management, not Progpow. Progpow may just detract from progress on the Ethereum roadmap, I don't know, I have no opinion).

I suggest that someone in charge puts out a letter that the leadership appreciate the feedback from the community as of late, that it's taken seriously, and that you think the debate has benefited Ethereum and the community. The letter could contain a short description of the most important issues raised the last week and a statement saying that leadership will come to an understanding of these issues and comment on them in a few/days weeks (however long it takes to get organized and come to rudimentary agreements).

1881,"I've appreciated your comments in this thread, and hope you'll lurk less and post more here on Reddit.

I appreciate that all these folks are human, and to some extent, that is what worries me most.  Humans get power hungry, and are swayed by economic incentives- especially when they are given a common interest and an organization with substantial followership. I'm looking beyond today, to a future in 5 or 10 years, when things may look very different.  That is why I prefer to focus more on articulated power structures, rather than relationships (especially when billions of dollars may be at stake).  And if you want proof, just look at those who have self-ostracized and gone off and started their own competitors.  To my eyes, I'm not sure the evolution of Polkadot is different than these examples, aside from more amicable rhetoric around the split, and continued development support of Ethereum alongside their own project goals.

So how would you classify EOS, for example.  Are they reviled simply because Dan Larimer is not friends with Eth people?  Many in this community had no issue with taking up arms against them.  But simultaneously, many openly support Polkadot (a chain with planned on-chain governance and concentrated token distribution, and also a very lucrative ICO- although as we know, funds were lost).

Is EOS hostile to the greater crypto community?  Or do we just not like Dan Larimer?  What makes EOS bad and Polkadot good?  Is it the fact that Ethereum and Polkadot share a cofounder?  Or that it is developed by Parity- who has supported Ethereum in the past and still does?  Or is that many prominent in the Ethereum community hold DOTs?

I ask these questions because frankly, I'm not sure I can trust any heavily VC-funded chain.  I realize the people at Parity are probably all great people, but that doesn't obviate some of the points I made that they would profit if Ethereum stalled (even for a time).  And this suggestion was perhaps given credibility by the comments of some who chose to directly compare Ethereum to Polkadot as competitors (and it's not just Afri saying that, it's others).

So I don't know what to do about any of this.  I don't think the folks at Polkadot / Parity are bad people, but the level of possible conflict of interest (or even just perceived) makes me very uneasy.

The difficulty is we have an open network, with many different actors that all need each other, but who’s interests are not always aligned. 

There should be effort pointed towards innovation regarding an inclusive platform that facilitates creating insights, an overview of who has which interests and how to weigh those in a decision making process. 

Right now it’s a mess! And people get damaged! And when we accept that as ‘that’s just how it is’, the community starts to crumble. We all need each other, we need to find a way to make this work, otherwise we will not succeed. For real. The ideal will die and the people with the loudest mouths and the most money will once again win and take everything. 

Besides a tech solution that creates insight and an overview, it’s also about introspection. How can you yourself, get to understand the views of other actors? And how can you show some compassion?

We can draw at least one conclusion: our current platforms of communication (Twitter and Reddit) are not good enough. 

I’ve been here since November 2015, where everything was just love and hope. Now that we’ve moved into big bucks territory, the tone has changed and people less well capable of combining an investor perspective with a tech perspective have come in. That’s ok. That happens when you grow. But we as old school gang, (JT, Souptacular, Nooku, insomniasexxx, DC, Cutsnek, pipebomb and quite a few more) We need to set the tone of this debate. We need to voice that the way this situation developed and derailed, is not what we are here for. 

We need open discussion and we need to be vulnerable in that discussion. Open about our fears, like DC does when he talks about how he sees polkadot as competing with ETH serenity. And how Afri fuels that fear when he directly states that polkadot is better suited than Serenity, especially from the position he (Afri) is in. 

I don’t want this to be a ‘why can’t we all just get along?’ post. We have to take this seriously and make sure we do better next time. Because otherwise Afri was right about one thing: polkadot is better suited to facilitate a multi chain future, they have that built in from the get go. And ethereum will lose momentum and become a memory of people the were there at the start.

1926,"**Conflict of interest**

A conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another.  Typically, this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to make decisions for the benefit of a third party.

The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of impropriety. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any corruption occurs.

Im surprised you would say it doesnt matter, it most definitely does matter. Either way its a subjective opinion whether you are correct or not. The best way is to let any such information be out in the open and let the community be the judge of that. Having a COI does not imply that people can't work or be involved.

From work with several non-profit consensus-based organisations and alliances, I now think that declaration and management of interests is a positive part of effective decision making, not just something negative to be managed (particularly for groups wanting public legitimacy and/or accountability).

(Eg, An alliance of people with overlapping and therefore partly diverging interests can often achieve more than a narrow group of people with perfectly aligned interests).

There are lots of frameworks out there used to declare/manage interests among non profit style collaborations (eg given previous reference in his AMA to academic approaches, see [here](https://theeducationalliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Declaration_and_Conflicts_of_Interest_Policy_2.0_Jan_2017.pdf) .).

Part of the problem is that trust is this fashion is not scalable, and it alone is not sufficient to ensure positive outcomes. While positive outcomes are never assured, understanding people's economic COIs can be informative.  Would you trust Dan Larimer if he offered his assistance to Ethereum in a position of leadership?  Unfortunately, it is inevitable that at least some people inevitably betray others' trust- especially in large complex organizations.  Did you trust Charles Hoskinson at one point?  Would you trust him now?

Even though many of you are great friends, people's situations change.  Trust between you and others is important to do your work.  But people also need to have the trust of the community to serve in positions of fiduciary responsibility.  And even though many will say that Ethereum is just software, it isn't- it's a very important economic network.  Perhaps the most important economic network that will ever been created.

I don't know what the answer is, but having some COI disclosure for folks in positions of decision-making is probably appropriate.

I know that the devs have the hardest job. I recognize you're the ones doing the ACTUAL work and putting in the time to build the protocol into what it is and what it will become. I have in the past (and will continue to in the future) defend the devs against the ethtrader hoards who seem to endlessly complain that other people aren't doing enough work to make them money faster. The devs have a really tough job in not only releasing a functional product, but also trying to make everybody happy with this product (which we all know is an impossible goal). You have taken up a challenge which is far greater than most people will ever attempt.

And so with that said, I write the following with the upmost respect for all of the devs, who tirelessly contribute code, both with and without compensation:

This makes it sound like you're in a high school clique, and you don't know and/or don't care about anybody else at your school.

Ethereum isn't a plucky start-up with just a handful participants any more. In fact, at this very moment the market estimates that it's worth $15,247,070,122. There are people who have built entire businesses based on the protocol.

I think it's great that the devs meet frequently, collaborate with other projects, go out for drinks and get to know each other personally -- it sounds like a great way to deepen trust and build community. But the larger Ethereum community is much more than this. There are plenty of people who are equally (if not more) invested in the outcome of the protocol who simply can't attend all the conferences, and therefore miss the ability to make these networking connections, and get to know other contributors on a personal level. However, your words make it sound like these people are second-class citizens. We get stuffed in coach while the devs all mingle up in first class/hang out at a ski retreat.

Obviously, there needs to be some form of meritocracy -- people who can't write code shouldn't insist on contributing code. And code is obviously what fuels this whole endeavour. But -- and I say this as a stern and loving father -- it sounds to me like Ethereum needs to 'grow up,' and realize that the world is a big place, and that the Ethereum community consists of far more than the handful of people who have the time and the ability to attend ETHDenver.

I believe its high time for you guys to analyse why did this happen and if it could have been avoided? If you decide to be stubborn and blame everything on trolls and community it will happen again. You guys gave yourself a very ambitious goal, you are constantly growing in value and reputation, it would be naive to think that you will not get more attention in the future. You should consider creating a safer space/environment to buidl and focus on your goals.

Its natural to blame yourself and keep saying that you should have done more to defend him, while I think its better to think - I should have done more not to let it go this far. u/mariapaulafn mentioned that this has been going on basically since the parity bug, maybe I dont remember the whole situation, but I have a feeling that the case wasn't addressed so much from ef/parity and created this whole environment for crazy conspiracy theories...maybe the sensible thing would have been after that to let Afri work as contractor...I know hindsight 20-20 but you guys should sit down and analyse what went so horribly wrong for a person to leave because he felt threatened (this is not just for Afri sake) and how to avoid this in the future. Maybe considering creating a PR department who could handle this kind of situations before they escalate or ask Consensys for help...just dont ignore problems and hope they will go away...look at the ama you did recently, 90+% of people there  can be reasoned with, that is your community who stands behind you, but you need to interact with them...not everyone of the thousands out there can go to conferences and meetups to get to know you. Heck I even believe that there were people in the ama that would be happy to buy Afri a beer or 5 and talk about the whole thing to better understand his pov and in some slight drunkennes realise that he is something like a long lost cousin or whatever :).

Another advice, you should look for ways how to remove pressure from you guys...yes you are super smart, talented, strongly opinionated and/or slightly on the introvert side but you are not super heroes!!!...this is just my opinion and I enjoy to listen to your dev calls but do you guys really need public streams? I believe it was Peter S. who brought up a totally valid point that you are under so much scrutiny that you need to triple check everything you want to say so that it won't be interpreted the wrong way, but the thing is if someone wants to stir up controversy he/she will twist your statements anyway, dont give more ammo to your haters...run your usual calls, maybe add every time 1-2 random community members as witness to avoid bilderberger conspiracies (besides the usual introduction chit chat and bla blas, the visitors would be of course muted not to hijack the call with potential bs), post meeting minutes on reddit or wherever, community will talk about it, someone from the devs participating on the call would answer or clarify possible questions in the thread, rotate the devs so its not always the same person answering...I know it might be controversial to drop your public calls but it might be good for your mental health, you would have a safer space to discuss things, joke around, people participating might see you as human beings and maybe feel more involved...not saying that this is perfect approach, it has its flaws...

2023,"The difficulty is we have an open network, with many different actors that all need each other, but who’s interests are not always aligned. 

There should be effort pointed towards innovation regarding an inclusive platform that facilitates creating insights, an overview of who has which interests and how to weigh those in a decision making process. 

Right now it’s a mess! And people get damaged! And when we accept that as ‘that’s just how it is’, the community starts to crumble. We all need each other, we need to find a way to make this work, otherwise we will not succeed. For real. The ideal will die and the people with the loudest mouths and the most money will once again win and take everything. 

Besides a tech solution that creates insight and an overview, it’s also about introspection. How can you yourself, get to understand the views of other actors? And how can you show some compassion?

We can draw at least one conclusion: our current platforms of communication (Twitter and Reddit) are not good enough. 

I’ve been here since November 2017, where everything was just love and hope. Now that we’ve moved into big bucks territory, the tone has changed and people less well capable of combining an investor perspective with a tech perspective have come in. That’s ok. That happens when you grow. But we as old school gang, (JT, Souptacular, Nooku, insomniasexxx, DC, Cutsnek, pipebomb and quite a few more) We need to set the tone of this debate. We need to voice that the way this situation developed and derailed, is not what we are here for. 

We need open discussion and we need to be vulnerable in that discussion. Open about our fears, like DC does when he talks about how he sees polkadot as competing with ETH serenity. And how Afri fuels that fear when he directly states that polkadot is better suited than Serenity, especially from the position he (Afri) is in. 

I don’t want this to be a ‘why can’t we all just get along?’ post. We have to take this seriously and make sure we do better next time. Because otherwise Afri was right about one thing: polkadot is better suited to facilitate a multi chain future, they have that built in from the get go. And ethereum will lose momentum and become a memory of people the were there at the start. 

So this is a call to action.

2280,"> An open community isn't one that launches a scorched earth campaign against people that dare say something negative about ethereum.

I absolutely agree that people should feel free to point out flaws and shortcomings with Ethereum, as well as question its future.  However, I think there are constructive and destructive ways to do this.  As 2 examples off the top of my head, both Vitalik and Vlad have previously publicly raised concerns about Ethereum in a way that was truthful, honest, and helpful. 

I think it's unfair and hyperbolic to characterize what has happened here as a 'scorched earth campaign.'  Afri publicly tweeted a meme suggesting that the product being made by his employer was going to surpass the product for which he was currently the release manager.  Yes, some reactions were emotional and over-the-top, but I don't feel it's unreasonable for stakeholders to suddenly question his motives, and ask for clarification when such a brazen statement was made publicly.  In my mind, that's mostly what these last few threads have contained.

If it really wasn't a big deal, it could have been cleared up with a simple clarification, and we could continue debating conflicts of interest rationally and without all this added baggage of emotion.  Instead, he effectively 'took his ball and went home.'  I wouldn't hold it against anybody to take some time to themselves and process all of these events to consider their options, but please understand that going dark does the opposite of inspiring confidence to many who are already out-of-the-loop.

Frankly, without leaning too heavily into the part of 'the grumpy old man,'  I think a lot of prominent folks in the Ethereum community have some lessons to learn about growing up, public relations, and the value of professionalism (the same could be said for a lot those calling for Afri's head on a stick, as well).",19-02-19-04-43,9,2236,ethacct,arzrwv,2280,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,344

I don’t think the answer is removal from the community, and I also don’t think the community is the only group to “blame,” if we’re talking about blame (although I don’t think we should think in those terms). 

I also think all of this drama is a distraction for why everyone is here: to give Ethereum to the world. Part of me thinks this could still be avoided by Afri just coming forward and step by step explaining why he said what he said—what I mean is, to reconcile. He could begin with an apology (even if some people don’t think one is needed) for any misunderstanding his tweet caused, and for him to give detailed explanations about why he made his claim (and I don’t mean him saying that he owns equal dots and eth. Instead it should be something constructive about why he got into and still believes in Ethereum, and X and Y reasons are why Polkadot is currently better than Serenity). Because I don’t think that the backlash was caused by Afri per se. It was more of a response out of confusion by the community. For example, confused questions like why is he the Ethereum upgrade manager if he believes this? Why is he even working on Ethereum if so? Those kinds of questions left unanswered results in people looking at only the things they know (Afri’s tweets, his past, where he currently works, etc.). 

I still think there’s a redemption story here for both camps and in the end if Afri cares about Ethereum and it’s mission, a few extreme comments that resulted from his unorthodox approach to engage in discussion shouldn’t keep him from still working with his friends in Ethereum and on the project he believes in. He should clear up the misunderstanding, if there is one, by addressing his critics and everyone hopefully can carry on after understanding things a bit better.

This is a problem /r/ethtrader faces every day (As well as /r/ethereum). This is why there is an initiative in place of developing sub based tokens for governance (been an interesting mess so far, not so good for governance imo) very tricky trying to prevent this type of behaviour. These other communities will use any situation to try and divide, they are not the ETH community that has been accused of malfeasance in the last day or so.   

There needs to be some acceptance that this was poorly handled in many ways (including Afri's decision to make that tweet). What we can do to prevent this kind of behaviour going forward that isn't in a dev vs eth community division. theDAO was truly ugly, things have also changed a lot since then. ETH has grown a lot in a small period of time, it needs strategies to deal with this to match it's growth.

It was some mining algorithm change created to ""kill off the evil asics"" and ""bring power back to GPU miners"".

It doesn't change in a way that lets more people in. In that people need money to buy GPUs, knowledge to operate them, skill to operate in a profitable way. It doesn't stop advantages in someone getting a bunch of GPUs from source before the average joe can get them on Newegg, doesn't stop GPU mfgs from mining on their hardware before selling to consumers, doesn't stop the network affect of ppl with more hash rate getting more mining rewards then using those mining rewards to expand their mining business and gain a larger network share, etc. 

ASIC mfgs will never be able to compete with GPU mfgs on a ProgPoW network. I know people like to make the argument that ProgPoW doesn't kill ASICs, but it does... GPU mfgs can operate at a loss for much longer... do the Xbox play. Sell machines at a loss for so many years and make it up after they gain market share. No one will buy ASICs if they are more expensive than GPUs. So no more ASICs on the network. Then capitalism and competition is going to take play in the GPU only network, and the people that can run their GPU mines the most efficiently will get ahead. Then we're in the same situation we're currently arguing.

That. It's the assumption that Nvidia's performance in progpow makes it the dominant manufacture for it which isn't true by my benchmarks. AMD keeps well up with Nvidia in hashrate numbers.

According to IFdefelse team, they reach out to both Nvidia and AMD GPU engineer teams for comments and to overlook to algorithm. Changes were made that brought improvements to [AMD without any loss to Nvidia.](https://medium.com/@ifdefelse/progpow-progress-da5bb31a651b)

Fortunately for most of us, we have the opportunity to learn this lesson outside of the glare of the public eye, and without being tasked with deploying updates for software worth billions of dollars.  It makes the embarrassment easier to stomach (or it did for me anyways) but the lesson remains the same: words actually DO mean things, and actions have consequences. 

I saw Hudson's tweet that he was angry at the Ethereum community, but I think perhaps that anger is misplaced.  In my mind, the community reacted quite rationally to the information that was presented.  Analogy time:

Let's say that the person who was in charge of launching rockets at SpaceX had been tweeting about how he was unsure about the upcoming changes to future SpaceX rockets, speculating that perhaps they would be unsafe or unstable when it was time for the upgrade to happen.  Then one day, he makes the public declaration that Blue Origin was going to be everything that SpaceX aspired to.  You really don't think that the SpaceX stakeholders would question keeping this person in charge of launching rockets at SpaceX, regardless of what a great rocket scientist he was, or the numerous contributions he has made to the company in the past?   I don't feel like the stakeholders are the people to blame in this scenario -- that lies entirely with the employee who made the completely avoidable decision to publicly state his contrary objectives.

Assuming something positive comes from this, I'll actually be glad for this drama and the way it has played out.  It's certainly shone a light on some of the short-comings and inefficiencies of the Ethereum development and governance processes.  I don't think there's a 'silver-bullet' answer to all of it, but more accountability, transparency, and representation clearly would not hurt.

2372,"Afri stepped down and I'm here to convince you this is a positive result and a worthy first step on the path to clearing some of the corruption we've seen in the Ethereum ecosystem. The sappy part of the ""dev community"" and the various others who have been compromised by their real world relationships with Parity, and/or financial investments in Polkadot, will bemoan the crazy mob and try to make everyone feel guilty for this ""great tragedy"". I think we should ignore them... They're naive and haven't been paying attention to what has been happening beneath the surface.

It's all very simple to understand. Rather than start everything from scratch by forking the protocol, Parity has been poaching talent (see Chainsafe, Aragon, and others) and stealing network effects from the Ethereum base in order to create and drive new converts into an alternate privatized version of the Ethereum ecosystem (Web3 Foundation, Polkadot/Substrate). They've tried to make us dependent on their tech and community services because it makes it easier for them to stage a coup against the Foundation. Their plan, visible in all their actions, has been to divide and conquer us all along; to take as many devs and users away from the Ethereum ecosystem as possible, so that they might one day start afresh as the new defacto leadership.

Afri is merely a symptom (or casualty) of this underlying reactionary movement. There have been red flags and misaligned incentives from day one, and that's certainly cause for concern, but I also think it goes quite a bit deeper than all that. What we have here is a bad actor trying to covertly undermine us from within because of a fundamental misunderstanding of what Ethereum is trying to accomplish. Basically, this bad actor doesn't understand (or, more likely, finds it to be in their financial interest not to understand) that the fundamental protocol (layer 1) must be under public control (or elite control acting in the public interest) whereas the various dapps built on top (layer 2) can have any arbitrary kind of control. Parity wants tyranny, which is private control at the base layer. They can't be allowed to have that. To compare Ethereum 2.0 to this imitation is a mere superficial insult over a glacier of misunderstanding.

I should add that I do think key players in the Foundation realize all this and that their grant to Parity was a feeble attempt to pacify a visible traitor into cooperation. Their leadership style has become more covert since late 2017 so I can only speculate, but I don't think they're as blind as they're letting on. Whatever the case might be, they seem to believe they're above public accountability and can just rule from the shadows or from their ivory tower; as if they can do no wrong; or as if the mob will only get in their way. This approach saddens me greatly. It's a losing strategy, in the end, as this will only weaken the Foundation's credibility and legitimacy. The right approach would be to open the channels of communication and facilitate the voice of as many people as possible. With radical transparency from the Foundation and broad support from grassroots interests we could easily handle these delicate controversial issues.

I find it eminently reasonable to think Parity is aiming for a hostile takeover. They should be treated with the utmost suspicion and carefully excised of influence wherever appropriate. If that means we have to replace a few egos in the process and cause other irritating delays, so be it. We should all gladly accept that as a fair price for creating high integrity software.",19-02-18-11-42,9,85,lntrospectre,arr7c6,2372,0.128,0.16399999999999998,0.708,0.1933,155

2383,"I am not going go into each and every instance of management abuse, where either Management has targeted individuals, creating a hostile work environment, or where management invents new variations of yoga to justify ""how they are perfectly decentralized and representative"".

But I will cite the abuse shown toward Kosala, by Management, and Yoichi, by Management. Both of these individuals were hard working, low profile persons of ethical character. Both got harassed extensively by management. It is a true shame when being a technology developer also requires having a strong grasp of subversive politics.

I strongly, strongly object to rEthereum being about things that are *not* Ethereum. In particular, Parity, MyCrypto, or anything of this nature. These things cloud the discussion, and shift the focus on Ethereum away to side projects, which have differing objectives.

I want rEthereum to be accountable to Ethereum. I don't want the buck to be passed to MyCrypto, and pretend as if ""well, we couldn't stop them from flaring everyone and their mother to promote their products""! Nope. It is YOUR (Vitalik, literally, as he is head dev of this forum) responsibility.

I don't want to have a negative view toward Parity and MyCrypto, which I STRONGLY do, and have that affect my enjoyment of Ethereum.

---

Moderation of these forums is insanely biased. The ""automod"" is fairly ridiculous. For almost a year, discussion of the subsidy was banned topic due to the extreme amount of keywords banned. If it involved Ethereum, it should be allowed. How is discussion of Eth Subsidy banned but Parity, MyCrypto, and everything under the sun someone has to sell next isn't?

Sure, the aggressive mods will tell you it's for this and that - but each removal should require individual, mod ownership of the removal. The use of blacklisting accounts or blacklisting huge swarms of keywords for topics mods don't want discussed is being used to silent dissent.

Mods need to take individual ownership of content removal, and not use a 3rd party bot.

The brigading is getting quite nuts, in particular with Parity and MyCrypto. Comments that effectively amount to ""shut the heck up, let Vitalik do what he wants"" get instant +10 AND Gold with regularity, while commenters criticizing management get individually threatened. This is truly absurd. Vitalik sees this, but does nothing.

And Vitalik should be held to a higher standard, because his words and his statements do not agree with the actions of Ethereum - nor does he criticize Eth managers that go against his statements. It's one thing for Vit to criticize BTC, BCH, and Iota... that's weird political sniping, but whatever... it's completely something different when he sells ETH as 'deflationary' or 'decentralized' and the management he installs does everything but this.

That's avoidance - and something unacceptable of management. When he talks, and talks, and talks, about Ethereum but stays silent while the community gets f'd in the a, it speaks. Silence - speaks.

Ethereum Foundation, official, is throwing ETH around all the time, often to projects in which the receivers of the funds either sit on the board or are close personal contacts to ETH members.

They keep having something called ""Core Devs"" but often these people decide things WAY beyond the scope of standard development, or bulk community wishes. Why did a 75% vote for 1 ETH get denied? Because of made up reasons decided that day.

Why do certain powerful people get invited, or only select members of the community? Why can the community not elect the people whom it chooses to represent them? Why do the Core Devs always approach meetings with all ""questions"" pre arranged and decided?

I recall watching Casey get shot down hard for merely suggesting the ""Core Devs"" respect the 75% vote for 1 ETH. Why??? How is it acceptable to personally attack only *some* people during meetings? How???

Why does it always tend to be those that favor the will of the community, instead of the inner circle who decided everything before hand?

We need full scale reform of the decision making process in Ethereum. We need ACTIVE community inclusion. We need to remove the brigades and third party promoters from management, in particular of these forums.

We need to be able to criticize ETH without experiencing years of blacklisting for doing so. EVERYONE in the communities knows that if they criticize MyCrypto or Parity, you will be f'd out of any chance of getting a slice of the multi-million dollar pie, which they are just splitting between themselves anyway.

How is this just? How can Vitalik be so vocal on things that have no importance to Eth, but so silent when it comes to people he knows personally are screwing it up? How can he say one thing, while he knows the managers which he had a hand in installing, or maintaining their positions, will go against all of his verbal statements?

How can Vitalik stand aside while select individuals destroy this community?

I would never, ever, ever buy Afri bucks. But Ethereum *was* Vitalik bucks. What was sold was the personality, intellect, and commitments of Vitalik.

I mean .... Vitalik himself is barely out of school .... and it's hard to expect professional standards from volunteers working for free like Afri apparently is/was doing .... so his childlike handling of the situation I guess shouldn't be a huge surprise.

Perhaps the bigger question is why professional managers and engineers were never hired to do such co-ordination and work, in order to move things forward at a far faster rate (as was certainly possible over the past year or two or three), or at least in a more professional manner. It seemed like at least at one point they had a good amount of money they could have put towards this, but rather all they really seemed to do was offer the occasional ""grants"" .... I don't know now how healthy their financials still are ....

I also have personal experience indicating a lack of professionalism in the people involved .... and that they're really not interested in hiring/building anything like a competent team of professionals to move this stuff forward better ....

Back when I had much more hope for Ethereum, I offered to help on some crucial work which appeared to be lacking the resources you'd assume would be allocated to such an essential part of such a project, and the Ethereum foundation dealt with me with what I'd probably have to label as dishonesty - I would've been totally understanding if they simply weren't interested in my help, but rather, they basically tried to trick me into working for little to nothing, rather than being honest upfront that they simply weren't really looking to pay anything close to market rates, even though I made very clear all along what my expectations were in that regard .... the most charitable reading I could make of their behaviour was ""extremely unprofessional"".

Since then my cynicism regarding Ethereum's future has just grown and grown and grown ... while they don't appear to be the complete clown-show that has been BTC-core for some time now, from what I can tell they're still nowhere close to the professional level that you'd get at any competent tech company / start-up, while I imagine some of the newer coins with much more funding actually being spent on professionally managed teams of paid professionals like EOS etc *are* running at such a professional level.

2404,"I feel very sorry for Afri as an individual, but yes there is a much bigger picture at stake here and this unfortunate incident has brought to focus some things that need urgent attention. Here is my suggestion:

1. EF radical Transparency, use the tools eth enables if possible. A) Let everyone see as much as possible of the accounts and where funds are going/managed B) regular updates, say Quarterly about what EF is doing, who works at EF, hirings (and firings), grants, funds management, plans (not tech, the EFs non tech plans) for the year/s ahead (updated every quarter).
2. Institute some sensible guidelines for anyone taking a somewhat formal role in Ethereum efforts. The first being anyone working for EF, the second anyone considered a core dev. These would not be something to be ""enforced"", they would be guidelines that would actually help individuals better understand how to best deal with being in such vaunted positions and is for their benefit first and foremost. At the same time it gives more clarity to them about what the public expectations might be. 
3. Any such guidelines should include that people in such positions would best make a simple clear transparent statement about any possible conflicts of interest
4. Greater communication from entities that people currently look to in times of confusion. Currently EF, but that may change. Maybe ethmagician's will fill some of the void, maybe Molloch related will do something who knows, but today EF's silence is deafening. To be clear I do not mean that we stretch the already stretched shoulders of researchers and dev's, this should no longer be something that Vitalik has to once again step in to help. His voice is hugely valuable/respected. But a simple paid role for someone under EF to on a day to day basis manage communications will be very useful. That role may well require them to hear from the most influential and respected voices to understand the issues better but also needs balanced review of the broader ecosystems stakeholders and to constantly gauge sentiment
5. Support Afri in getting through this personally (even if he leaves the ethereum project), but lets not simply blame ""mobs"", this is ignoring the underlying reasons for such an outpouring of anger (no denying some was  distasteful), instead look to address the underlying problems. A) Hold an AMA about parity/ethereum potential conflicts with senior and respected figures from the 2 teams. B) Don't simply avoid the issue, the big question may well be: Should there be a friendly and effective parting of ways now to avoid a much more painful and difficult splitting of the 2 groups later. 
6. Overall there is a growing perception (eg Fred Wilsons post) and more generally that the Ethereum project is rudderless. its hard to be decentralised and yet give everyone the sense of a strong focused team and clear direction and the balance will always appear to be off, but until today Ethereum has done this better than any other project Im aware of. Today my senses tell me its gone a little too much on the loose side. But surely there are ways to address the shortcomings without having to be more centralised. The suggestions above are done in that light. Greater transparency and communications from EF, voluntary guidelines offered to participants to both help them handle being in such a position as well as set better the expectations on them, voluntary disclosure / statement of any conflict of interests and squaring up to a real serious issue surrounding Parity's relationship to Ethereum and how best to deal with it.

The only thing I remember is thinly veiled statement that ""We will keep 'working' with the community until our funds are unlocked."" Rather than stating that they would accept that the community did not want this.

There is a reason a part of the community is wary of Parity's intentions. The situation with Afri and following radio silence on all fronts doesn't help resolve this at all. Also calling anyone criticizing the status quo an angry bag holder, troll, bully and dismissing the community at large with general smugness and or contempt is **really** not helpful. A lot of people are invested in ethereum now, they want it to succeed be it for financial or ideological reasons or both.

When they see someone who has done questionable things in the past, raised concerns that were brushed to the side as nothing, acting that way again whilst in a position that people perceive to have a large sway on the direction of ethereum, they will lash out.

Twitter is not the place for this kind of discussion, especially not through a poorly thought out meme.

When you are in a position such as this there is a certain level of professionalism required, it has been lacking for some time. ETH is in the process of moving from a start up type culture to a global platform, the leadership needs to reflect that as well.

There is definitely conflicts of interest at play here and it seems no one really wants to tackle the elephant in the room because it's easier to pretend everything is fine.

2436,"I'm not sure I get it. Are people complaining because Afri tweeted polkadot is better than Ethereum 2.0, or because they worry there are ""infiltrated"" EF members working to undermine Ethereum? 

Edit: it is 2am and I really, really need to sleep.  I've now read the whole thread and will share my opinions because I'm worried about some things I've read. Keep in mind those are my personal opinions. I don't speak in behalf of the EF and much less Vitalik, and I have no idea what others think. Also, I'm not sure I understood the issue completely, so, pardon me if I didn't.

First of all, the EF (and in special Vitalik) aren't Ethereum's leaders, the community is. We are your workers. Put yourself in your position of power.

About Afri or ""Ethereum insiders"" secretly plotting to destroy it. I don't know him nor am aware of his intents. But I'm an EF member *openly* plotting to destroy it. Literally, if you read my [ongoing work on Moonad](https://github.com/moonad/moonad), you'll notice my mission is to destroy all things Ethereum does wrong; in special, Solidity. So, perhaps you should redirect all your hate to me instead? I could see myself tweeting ""Formality delivers what Solidity ought to be, change my mind"". I mean, the EF has been supporting opposing ideas since the beginning, and that's one of the things I loved about it. Haven't we even given a grant for Ethereum Classic, of all things? So, I applaud Afri's hypothetical desires to destroy us. If he thinks he has better tech, please, go ahead and do it!

The only reason I'm working for Ethereum is I want to see code being written and problems being solved. We have a collapsing world that needs real solutions to real problems, fast. When you believe you are saving lives in the long run (and I do), you can't afford fighting over team uniforms. That's why I signed up for it: back then, it was sold to me as an alternative to Bitcoin's failure to advance. It used to be the one community that was focused in making progress, not money, above anything else. Did I get that wrong?

Now, if you're an investor worried about Ether's value as a token, then, that's a different (and valid) concern. Keep in mind, though, that Ethereum is a Turing-complete blockchain. That means whatever solution I or Afri comes up to ""destroy it"" can and will be quickly incorporated as a series of smart-contracts. For that reason, I find it very unlikely that anyone will ever ""destroy"" it anytime soon, in the sense of a major MySpace/Digg-like migration event. Its stablished network effect, combined with the fact it is such a perfect sponge of innovation, makes that scenario very unlikely. At least, that's how I see it, but I could be wrong.

Anyway, those are the reasons I'm personally not worried about, and will keep endorsing, anyone trying to ""destroy"" us, well-intentioned or not.

2501,"Thanks, interesting reading that document. Though I find the wording interesting:

""After the events unfolded during this past weekend that resulted on a massive outburst of accusations, conspiracy theories, demands, and verbal violence triggered by **mob mentality**, it is time, as a community, that we take a look at other tech communities and develop our own protocols (in case of abuse of power, harassment), talk about what is tolerable and what we should condemn and in which form, and work on our own procedures to behave as a unified, however decentralized community that has mature protocols and processes to deal with event that might jeopardize people’s integrity, and therefore, Ethereum’s development (eth is developed by humans!) "".

I think the discussion here has been for the most part been pretty respectful. Yes there has been unacceptable behavior in terms of threats or attacks against Afri in this case. However this was self inflicted to a degree, (this does not excuse the attacks and such on Afri) this was entirely avoidable if Afri has taken a minute to look at it from a different point of view, the view of your average community member.

I think this discussion needs to also entail professional standards and expectations on social media platforms for key contributors, yeah it sucks but it would prevent these types of events in the future and thus reduce the chance of verbal abuse. As others have said I think the Ethereum community is open to discussions of current limitations of ETH 2.0 design if presented in a respectful way, Afri did not do this.

I've seen many robust discussions on here about a myriad of different competitors to ETH and the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to design, strategy and implementation. It's all about having basic tact when approaching it. It's one of the reasons I love reading this sub, but have not really contributed much until this point.

2569,"I believe so. The problem is that the centralized stablecoins have stolen the spotlight. 2-3 years ago the word ""decentralized"" actually meant something. Now we see multiple projects and platforms centralizing at an alarming rate.

The real winners will be the decentralized stablecoins. As far as I know there are less than a handful that can even fall in the category of 'decentralized' Of that handful, even less are 'truly' decentralized.I like DAI, and am impressed that it actually weathered through the extremely bearish ethereum market. However the sooner it can diversify its collateral, the better.

I am really interested in another project. [BitBay.Market](https://BitBay.Market)BitBay is almost finished with it's unique ""Dynamic Peg"" Protocol. It is not a hard peg. It doesn't require collateral. It simply allows investors to adjust supply in order to accommodate ever-changing demand. This can be achieved through a democratic voting consensus. Coin holders can attach votes to stake rewards and vote to either increase, decrease, or hold steady the current total coin supply. You have to stake to vote, so market mover manipulators that are trying to juggle the price on the exchanges have no voting power if they are stacking all their coins in the order books!Paul Donovan said it best back in Nov. 2018, "" *Every economist knows the store of value is about balancing supply and demand and with crypto currencies you cannot control the supply in response to a drop in demand.* ""

BitBay will be able to do just what he thinks will be the end of Bitcoin.

The system basically works like this...Every 3.5 hours a voting session ends. Coin holders can either vote manually or let default algorithm decide for them. In the near future, there will also be customizable TA indicator algo's for  coin holders to use (RSI, STOCH, SMA, etc.)If price begins to drop, the majority consensus can vote to freeze 1-3% of the total coins supply (depends on vote count) per voting session. So in one day there is roughly 7 voting sessions. So coin holders could essentially vote to freeze upwards of 21% of the total coin supply in one day.This can go for as long as it takes. When price stabilizes or begins to recover, voters can begin voting to unfreeze the total coins supply.So basically a bear trend can only last a few days before it reaches a flat trade range accumulation zone or turns bullish again. We are talking days compared to bitcoin's ability to take 1-2 years!Bears can still sell if they wish, but any frozen coins they have will only be able to be sold on a secondary market ""futures market"". Any frozen coin input sold on an exchange will have a 1 month time lock before it can be transferred. This way bears can still sell but they have a very limited power against a coin that can always adapt to their next move, hence, ""Dynamic Peg"".The coin is not hard pegged so it can't 'break'. It can change and hold new value. This opens the doors to create an extremely lucrative hedging mechanism to bitcoin.BitBay has completed private testnet phase.

First of all, I dislike Polkadot as much as the next Etherean, however *Parity* did NOT receive $5mn for Polkadot. It was for ETH 2.0  development. There are milestones they must complete associated with the purpose of the grant.

Next, anyone that thinks Afri had unilateral control over the timeline of ETH 2.0 or any other release (e.g. Constantinople) is an idiot. Plain and simple. That isnt how Ethereum works. The release manager simply is charged with tracking progress of the client releases through testing and proposing a block height at which the fork will go live in production.

His tweet was provocative, and ill worded for the mass of reddit trolls who don’t know Afri and how he communicates. He’s blunt and provocative, and he was passionate about Ethereum development. His entire point was to stir the pot to get people off their asses... because there’s no time to be resting on laurels with the next competitor always right around the corner.

Let’s address COIs... this isn’t enterprise software development. People have many holdings, work for companies and teams developing and researching for multiple blockchains.

For transparency... what more do you want? Do you want the EF to publish their reviews of grants applications? I’m sure they’d do so.

Look at Alexey (Ledgerwatch) and the backlash and threats he got for opening advocating more research into ProgPoW.  Like a bunch of spoiled children demanding something and then abusing it... ruining a perfectly good thing.

I know this sounds incredible, but it's true and amazingly powerful.

2628,"You could deposit your Eth into trade.io and exchange it for TIOX. With the TIOX you can contribute it to the exchange's Liquidity Pool and earn interest on it. Trade.IO is a new exchange which had their ICO in Nov 2017 and has been up and running paying out for most of 2018. 50% of the exchanges profit goes to the liquidity pool participants of which they've paid out $188k since going live. You can also trade crypto on their FX market and buy crypto with a credit card. Trade.io are aiming to become THE crypto investment bank which will not just have crypto, but also FX and commodities. It does not seem Ponzi like in any way, especially since they don't promise ""huge returns"".
They are transparent, continuously building and onboarding new coins and have reliably paid out daily. At this point their volumes are still low so profit is low but at the numbers we already have you can expect between 1% and 10% yearly profit depending on the tier you fall in based on the amount you deposit. This can go much higher with more volume on the exchange.

One issue though, US citizens may not participate in the Liquidity Pool yet, but it is in the works.

2629,"I'm not sure why people are so quick at dismissing P3D. I'm into it (in fact, it's like 90% of my portfolio) and to be quite honnest it's the ONLY reason why I haven't been annihilated by the crypto winter. In fact I'm still up like 4x in *USD value* compared to when I got in a year ago. I also sold about as much last August on top of that.  
Now I understand it's easy to be scared bt the ""pyramid aspect"". But here are some technical facts:

-It's decentralized. No person is handling your money at any time ever.

-It's open source, which means anyone can look at the code and see *exactly* what it's doing, what the functions do, etc. If you can't read code, you can watch some videos of people explaining it line by line.

-You don't only get dividends from buys, but also from *sells*. Which unqualifies it as a Ponzi and is one of the main reasons it's still active.

-It can't be taken down and is going to run for as long as the Ethereum network lives.

-It has been copied dozens and dozens of times, and *every single one of them* turned out to be a scam : pre-mines, skewed dividends ratios, or just litterally `giveEverythingToOwner()` functions in the contract, you name it. But the original is still going strong and zero failure point has been found.

Now, don't get me wrong I was lucky to find it pretty early on and percentage wise I've made a killing, so I could be a little biased. And it's still a zero-sum game so for someone to gain, someone else has to lose. But I think that honnestly, if you want to get ROI from your Ether like you'd do with a rental property or dividends from shares, and you're feeling a bit lucky (it's still a game and was never advertised as an investment platform), this is pretty much one of the only options available.",19-02-18-04-25,1,281745,OlivierDeCarglass,armnwp,2629,0.0,0.068,0.932,0.6222,99
2630,"Hey, I don't know if you've heard of P3D? It's a token you buy with ETH. As a P3D holder you receive dividends (in ETH) every time someone else buys, sells or transfers their P3D.

So rather than just holding your ETH, you can be earning dividends on your ETH/P3D.

It's all done using a open source code smart contract.

New ETH isn’t being magically created from nowhere by any dapp, P3D isn’t an exception. This project is designed as an hourglass model in a particular way where all participants benefit as others buy, trade or sell tokens. This is all covered in detail on the wiki: https://powh3d.hostedwiki.co/pages/FAQ#wait-surely-someone-has-to-be-losing-money-for-this-to-work-right. At no point are promises made or do the devs pretend that new ETH is being magically created.

My sense is that this may require risk taking from aggregators’ part.

Let’s say zk-snark can wrap 500 transactions in one big transaction costing the aggregator $10 under normal gas price. So aggregators can pocket $40 ideally per such operation.

High speed data over radio has quite the limited range, usually requires licensing (or dealing with super high noise floor in unlicensed bands), and would really benefit from efficient/directional antennas at high altitude.

But urban environments are the only place this makes sense, as you point out.

It would be instructional to speak with the people who run Wireless ISPs in your city to see what kind of range they get and the challenges they face. If you have trouble finding a wireless isp in your city, it's because they are only practical in a few high density cities. Not that many people want it, they'll just get Comcast cable internet. 

And you'll run into that too, in any city dense enough for this to work, people techy enough to know what ETH is already have internet, so this is unnecessary.

I really wish something like this existed, I'd run a repeater node or internet gateway from an antenna on the roof of my house. I hate relying on Comcast.

My vision is a really cheap ETH wallet. Like $20 cheap. Very minimal functionality. Sending and receiving transactions with or without an internet connection. With optional privacy features.

2748,"Your cost model vastly overstates the attack cost at equilibrium. The reason is that the cost to perpetrate a 51% attack is at least partially subsidized by the rewards available to the 51% attacker while mounting the attack.  

At equilibrium, there is attack advantage because you the attacker are unknown and willing to pay to perpetrate your attack, whereas honest miners will come and go with the economics.  This can be exploited stealthily.

Let's say equilibrium hashpower is K GH/h and rewards are P/day.

If you bring on dK hashpower, gently, the hashpower will increase to K+dK and the rewards to miners will shrink to K/(K+dK).   Over some number of days dT this will cause some miners to be unprofitable and they will leave.  As long as you do not leave, but wait, sufficient unprofitable honest miners -dK will leave and the total will be K again.  You will now hold fraction dK/K of miners.  You will have earned between dK/(K+dK) and dK/K of the rewards dt P.  

Since this was equilibrium, your costs would be dT * P dK/K

So your net costs are less than (dT * P * dK) (dK/K(K+dK)) by about half. 

For small dK that works out to about 1/2 * dT * P * (dK/K)^2 

Bottom line, at equilibrium, a dishonest but patient attacker can take over the network gradually, and be repaid almost all of their costs to do so.

The main problem with ETH's gas price is it can spike very quickly so predicting that in a timely manner is very difficult. A good example of how to combat this would be using IDEX's approach where they're constantly using at least a few gwei higher than the recommended ""Fast"" to lessen the impact any spikes may have.

Then you can enter the secret words and bid amount and proceed on with the reveal.

2867,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this topic and continuing the discussion.  I don't have a suitable answer for ""what we should do"" to address these issues, but I do know that if we can't openly discuss them and what they might mean, then Ethereum faces a higher likelihood of being captured by corporate (or other) interests at some point down the line- perhaps being rendered compromised or irrelevant as a result.

As a community-driven, open source software development effort, community voices matter.  As we have seen from fervent ""shilling"" rife on crypto Reddit and Twitter in many communities, there is incredible power in economic incentives in driving individuals' behavior.  But sometimes, those voices may be speaking from a place of conflicting economic incentives (a condition which I agree is difficult to ameliorate satisfactorily)- and this does not just include folks from Parity.  Indeed, I suspect (and know for a fact) that many of the influential Ethereum community members invested in the Polkadot ICO.  It's hard to state what affect this might have on the conversation around Polkadot as a possible competitor (or ""partner"") to Ethereum, but I can assure you that it does have at least *some* effect.

I am in no way advocating for a ""Salem Witch Trial,"" but should core developers or those in positions of influence over Ethereum openly disclose their holdings and potential conflicts of interest to a Foundation Compliance Officer as a starting point (for private review, not public disclosure)?  I don't know, but maybe.  This would frankly be in line what leaders in organizations who make financial decisions are often required to do.  I realize some may see this as invasive, but the community is putting trust in these leaders.  Should there be some degree of controlled transparency to ensure that they are not subject to possibly conflicting economic incentives which might hurt that community?  Should someone with conflicting, overwhelming financial interests in a competing project be allowed to hold leadership roles on it?  If they are, might there be other ways to ensure that they are independent or have appropriate oversight?

I don't know the answers to any of these difficult questions.  But I do know that if this network ever comes to be valued in the trillions of dollars, the scrutiny behind these types of situations will only get stronger.  We would do well to get in front of some of this discussion, and think about how Ethereum, the Foundation, and the community could be most ready for such a discussion.",19-02-17-06-09,25,16074,DCinvestor,arbww3,2867,0.0,0.33299999999999996,0.667,0.3612,109

2869,"Thanks for the level-headed approach.

As one of the guys that voiced a more critical opinion on Afri on r/ethtrader I would like to clarify that... 

I have no problem whatsoever with Afri (or any other dev) working on several projects at the same time. Most interesting ideas lie at the crossroads of different projects/fields and devs that work in multiple projects will be there to pick them up and bring our attention to them. 

I have no problem with Polkadot or Parity. I like the job they have done with Parity client and find the approach to scaling taken by Polkadot interesting. I wish them success for the benefit of the ecosystem.

I have no problem with anyone raising criticism on Ethereum and bringing attention to its shortcomings, in fact I welcome it and promote such discussions. 

I do not have a problem with other coins. Economy is not a zerosum game. Multiple projects can be successful and their strength contributes positively to the ecosystem.

I do have a problem with Afri attempting to push in a very surreptitious way changes to the Ethereum protocol that had been amply criticized by community and experts. Looking only for their self-interest after they lost their funds.

I do have a problem with Afri promoting a change that will result in a schism of Ethereum during its transition to PoS. PoS being a fundamental part of the Ethereum roadmap since the very early days.

And I do have a problem (albeit smaller) with low effort trolling and FUD. If you think Polkadot is better than Ethereum 2.0, write a medium/reddit post detailing why. Sending a twit saying Polkadot is everything Ethereum 2.0 was set out to be but better, as the technical guy working on Ethereum for Parity... is just low, provides no constructive value and serves to seed FUD.

2899,"Upvoted you. You and I have less to disagree about than you might think. I'm completely for using this current situation to revisit our stances and question certain parties about theirs. Let's use the example of Afri as our example. As we know, Afri has come out in opposition against the current Eth roadmap. It's worrying, yes, for a dev working on core parts of Ethereum, but it's very far from criminal.

A research project thrives from being tolerant of divergent opinions that inspire new paths forward. It's not a problem in itself that Afri disagrees. It's a problem if he continues to disagree and repeatedly holds up development due to his disagreements. In my opinion, we haven't seen enough of this behavior yet. All we've seen is him disagreeing.

If I were Afri and I found that I had serious disagreements with the roadmap, I believe that the first steps of ethical behavior is exactly what he did: state publicly his opinion. This puts the disagreement out into the open and prevents exactly the kind of conspiracy that people are worried about. It's because Afri was so transparent that we're having this discussion. If he really wanted to screw us (the community), he would have kept it to himself and continued sabotaging Ethereum from the shadows.

Continuing this hypothetical, if I were Afri, I would have open dialogue with other members of the community, including core devs, possibly posting a couple Medium articles tracking the change of his thought process. Meanwhile, I would continue my work while agreeing to disagree when possible while abstaining from work that goes against my beliefs. After a period of deliberation and well-intentioned efforts of outreach, I would make a decision about whether to continue in the community.

Afri wouldn't be the first person to leave. Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, and many others moved on from working on the core team because of differences in opinion. Yoichi Hirai, for example, stepped down as EIP editor for ethical disagreements. Good for him and Afri as well if he chooses to leave. It's within the spirit of the blockchain community, a community which has built in mechanisms to fork.

I use Afri as an example because there's more reason to be skeptical about his continued participation than with Parity as a whole. Again, Parity runs the second biggest node software and has real people working their full-time job to keep the lights on at Ethereum. Saying that Parity has been screwing things up to secretly favor Polkadot over Ethereum is a serious accusation, and the burden of proof falls on the accusers, who all don't nearly have the same track record for giving to Ethereum. It's one thing for Vitalik to come out and doubt them. It's entirely something else for a random group of strangers online to do so.

I get that we all care about Ethereum a lot, and it's easy to come up with these theories when things go bad. However, we shouldn't throw out centuries of history and experience in due process just because we're swayed by the passions of the moment.

Probably no useful contract will break in practice. But they decided to redo the risk assessment 36 hours before the fork.”

3007,"I don't know what the reasoning that the original designers had was, but IMO there are two main positions I subscribe to in this debate:

1. The primary goal of Ethereum has never been to boost the price of Ether. It's a *secondary* goal, sure, but only because it will be helpful toward Ethereum's primary goal - being a secure, distributed, trustless smart contract platform. Higher Ether price boosts Ethereum's security, that's the only real reason to be concerned about it.

2. Quibbling about little details of issuance has very little impact on the price of Ether at this point anyway. It really doesn't matter much. If you look at the price charts over time you'll see that Ether rocketed to its all-time high and plummeted back down again with no change to its issuance model in that period. And that when an issuance change did happen it had no discernible effect on the price.

I'm not an analyst, but it seems pretty clear to me based on how Ethereum's price rises and falls in lockstep with the cryptocurrency market as a whole that it's really changes in *demand* that lead to significant changes in price. So if you really want to work toward boosting Ether's price for whatever reason, the best way to do that is to work toward increasing the demand for Ether. Boosting its utility is a good way to do that, getting it used for new applications so that people need Ether in order to get stuff done.

I think the exponential decreasing curve is too steep, and BTC is a special case in itself as it 'led the way'. It's a victim of it's own success in that sense. There was no possible way to know but it just seems massively disproportionate now given that early block rewards were 50 BTC when it was worth nothing and now it's changed ridiculously. It is a good store of value I agree with that, but as 'cash' I'm not sure. For example personally I want to have a bitcoin that I can just 'store in my basement' in the digital sense.

I guess this is where, in my (not comprehensive) understanding, the impossible balancing act comes.  As you said, it needs to have the store of value aspect, but people also need to want to spend it. If someone owned gold today they would just be holding it, that's how I would personally view any BTC holdings I had.

Part of it is just psychological too, 21m is really not a lot given the number of people in the world! All I was getting at was that I think that some inflation isn't bad as there will be 'growth of user base'. Perhaps I'm looking at it in a simplified way, but the best way I can explain it is using an example of 'consumable commodities' - foods and fuels etc we generally hope/expect will always be within the 'affordable' range for your average person, because there will be an increase in supply as well as demand (something I've just thought now writing this, this could be compared to eth's 'flexibility' in adjusting issuance). So in theory following this the value will grow as it's being used more widely but not so much that people won't want to use it.

Off the back of that is then the question of what might be better in terms of 'investment value' if it's considered that - holding something for scarcity or holding something because you feel there is going to be enough adoption to increase it's value despite some inflation!

1. Developing cures is much harder and more costly than symptom treatments.
2. There is far more money to be made by ignoring cures and prolonging disease as you say.

To be blunt, the latter being the core problem and society just letting it happen would be extremely fucked up, Hitler 2.0 level shit, but I think the former is the core problem.  There is probably a lot of the latter though, but I hope lack of tools/resources and ineptness is more the issue as opposed to calculated evil.

I've grappled with understanding this myself based on direct experience (see Disclaimer below).

Another reality is that until disease starts to affect more people instead of less (perhaps climate change dynamics and over-population downstream effects will cause this in the coming decades), the average person just simply doesn't care about this horrid issue :( as you can see evidenced by the low comment interest on this post thus far.  By the time most people have diseases, they're old enough to not care so much anymore anyway, ""I've lived my life and now I'm tired.""  So the remaining people are just unlucky ones and that's it.

Disclaimer: I was diagnosed with ICD-10-CM G90.59 at age 25, 4.5 years after symptoms began, deep into advanced ""suicide disease"" as its often called.  There were a lot of reasons why it took so long, but this is pretty typical from what I've discovered.  Part of the delay was my fault in not considering my full lifetime injury history as opposed to strictly events around the time the chronic pain began, but it's obvious in retrospect things like getting blasted with CT and x-rays a few too many times in a short timespan contributed to advancing the problem.  There's a lot more to my story but that's the most critical general aspect of my perspective on the world.  The MDs are almost completely lost beyond the most basic or common diseases at this time.

These points are dismal, but I'm hopeful in the back of my mind that ideas like you put forth will help fix the broken system for future generations.

EDIT to add something more constructive to cjdew's topic scope:

It all seems to be a massive quagmire regardless of how the funds for fruit-bearing research are raised/paid, but I think optimizing the incentive mechanisms definitely wouldn't hurt.

A big problem is the unknown unknowns.  A research study (even a sound one) can only do so much to understand what's actually going on because of the cost and limited tech.

For instance, sure I'm a case where whenever I pop even a low dose of Neurontin after letting the pain rein free for a while, it has a ridiculously helpful effect within two hours, when usually the benefits don't happen so fast at such a small dose for the average patient.  That's great except for the problem that the body adapts quickly in difficult to quantify ways and it basically becomes the whole progressive tolerance into ineffectiveness bs and you have to just stop taking the drug for a while, and then you get to have fun with optimizing the withdrawal.  There are cases of treatments that help in some ways but then screw up a bunch of other stuff, and sadly this is much more the norm than the exception with all the wall of text side effect warnings.

If MD culture can shift toward quantifying, appreciating, and preferring natural algorithms as the first line, that will help weed out the more easily solvable issues and reduce the burden they have to focus on the harder problems.  When you read about all sorts of ""natural deficiencies"" like more than 50% of First World people are deficient in critical things like magnesium, this is basic step one stuff.  The problem is natural algorithms that heal/cure are easily open sourced and can't realistically be sold for massive marginal profits, so the incentive isn't there for researching what natural algorithms work except for the patient experimenting themselves out of desperation or simply getting no long-term effective help otherwise.  And then you get all the people who do try to peddle natural algorithms, some of which work, some don't, some dangerous, and it's just a huge mess of trying to dig for signal in the noise.

The cost of synthetic treatment research compared to the lack of safe cures for much of anything as a result is really lame.  The biggest problem is there are so many variables and the MDs have only a few tools to measure a small set of them at this time.

The basic goal as I see it is we need more tools to *safely* and much more frequently monitor the parameters of the human body and the parameters of the external world state that affect the human body over long periods, not just short periods.  These noisy data streams can be analyzed with data science to find what objectively measurable patterns matter and correlate with subjective sign/symptom patterns.  Then we can more efficiently try to tweak and develop treatments/cures.  But clearly the key word *safely* is non-trivial (or in the least not cheap) or we would see this happening more quickly.

Perhaps the hardest part is that the human body has a set of common traits, but then a lot of traits that vary vastly from person to person.  Having tools to monitor everybody's ""parameter sets"" frequently overtime is really the only thing that makes any sense.

The future of medicine is going to be prevention by knowing what is going on inside and outside the human body sufficiently, and thus saying oh, just avoid the carcinogen X that is in environment Y instead of slowly developing cancer by unknowingly being silently exposed to carcinogen X over time.  Reality will be more complex than simple answers like that most likely, but it would be nice if God or the rules of the universe would give us a break and show that a lot of complex issues are simpler than they seem.

In the worst case we're hitting ""impossibility"" limits, but I doubt that.  I think we're just starting to scratch the surface on effectively monitoring what's going on.

""Curation markets allow us to harvest the best ideas in an open market — an innovation that pharma desperately needs. This is why we are building Molecule, a software platform to accelerate innovation. At its core, it allows participants to distribute and crowdsource chemical intellectual property, ranging from drugs to delivery methods, to combinations of chemicals. IP owners can relinquish partial ownership of their innovation in exchange for access to liquidity, research and funding in an open market. This creates new markets for research and development, as anyone — academics, corporations, investors, patients — can signal support and allocate resources by purchasing shares in the development of a specific drug.   


Owning a share of a compound has two distinct effects: first, it provides an incentive for researchers to create and publish both positive and negative data about compounds out in the open, accelerating innovation. Second, it provides legal rights for anyone to do so.   


In our vision, innovation can become self-enabling and sustaining as the original creator distributes ownership of the IP. The IP is owned by an autonomous market maker that distributes ownership based on demand and supply, using a token bonding curve.""

3048,"The following is overly nebulous/general and preaching to the wise choir, but as a principle competition is good in the long run.  What works will be discovered, what doesn't will fail.  There is room for multiple ""successful"" solutions, but historically the complicated nature of balancing centralization vs. decentralization often ends up with power law distributions of competing solutions (power law distributions are a hallmark sign of centralization).  This just means that there are a few solutions at the top used by everyone while every other competing solution ends up ""sharply failing to be in the majority"".  Whether solution centralization or solution decentralization is preferred is a matter of what our objective function is in a given ""solution seeking space's"" scope.  Decentralization of solutions is hard in a capitalistic system because of the ""fuck everybody but myself"" modus operandi of the average person.

The key for efficient invention/discovery is for those who fail to relentlessly get back up and keep tinkering.  More important is to adapt and support what works and leave behind what fails---to not get overly attached based on political bullshit.  It may suck to the average person's wishy-washy mindset, but humans have an incredibly difficult time building solutions in an optimal manner working as a group because of difficulty communicating what's really going on (there are reasons for this that won't be quantified for centuries to millennia, so it's semi-pointless to even bother trying to think about why at this time, let alone how to fix/reduce that problem).  That process is what really defines ""work"" in modern times.  This is why every data stream you measure on human group endeavors looks like perpetually drunken chaos.  The ""work"" process of finding the sufficiently optimal solution(s) is chaotic and fraught with risk everywhere since humans are extremely fallible and fuck up all the time because of Murphy's Law.  No matter how smart you or your group is relative to others, Murphy is always a step ahead of you.

Issues like you raise here are just par for the course to anyone who is anti-wishy-washy and understands human nature, but that being said, what you're doing with this post is providing significant value by helping push competing solutions to talk about something useful, economic incentives that ideally transcend any single competing solution to help all the solutions as a whole, regardless of who ends up on top.

3075,"Please know that my post does not question Parity's intentions (as I cannot know what those are).  Nor does it question the value of Parity's contributions to Ethereum development (which historically have been substantial).

*But it does question Parity's incentives,* as a firm who is actively (and perhaps primarily) now developing a blockchain other than Ethereum.  I stand by my analysis that Polkadot would benefit from Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0 ceding potential market share through delays.  Delays would not necessarily cause Ethereum to fail, but it could cause it to lose network effect and developer mind share.  Such delays would not require obvious sabotage, and could instead manifest in very insidious ways if key actors were intentionally malicious (or even subconsciously, perhaps unknowingly affected by their own financial incentives).

The entire Polkadot product is designed to enable the creation of other chains, and its primary value proposition may ultimately be that those other chains can connect to Ethereum.  That is more of a value proposition for those other chains and for Polkadot than it is for Ethereum.

*I don't mind Polkadot competing with Ethereum, but I do mind when it is competing with Ethereum and acts like it is not, and possible conflicts of interest go ignored, or worse, hidden.*

And saying that much of the work that Parity does for Eth 2.0 can also be reused for Polkadot isn't adequate incentive to ensure that Parity does best job possible for Ethereum.  It's only adequate incentive to do enough in order to support shared Polkadot development goals, while also maintaining in-roads into the Ethereum community (in case Polkadot fails, or in order to recruit developer interest).  Again, I'm not evaluating intent, I'm just evaluating incentives.

Finally, the $5 million grant (paid in phases) is inadequate incentive to counter such a conflict of interest, especially considering that there are likely individuals within Parity who control much more than $5 million worth of DOTs.",19-02-16-10-54,26,16074,DCinvestor,ar2xxh,63,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,124
3076,"> Serenity is solving ""Ethereum is really cool, but PoW is wasteful and we need it to scale"".

Yes, and that ""we need it to scale"" part is so that Ethereum can go on to do a lot of cool things, and be useful for many, many different use cases.  This statement almost trivializes its importance.

> Polkadot is solving ""There are all these different chains that have cool properties, but it's hard to secure them all, and they can't talk to each other"".

Please point to some of these different chains (at present) with cool properties which could not eventually connect to Ethereum via an L2 solution, and explain why Polkadot should be an L1.

> They are competitors in the same sense that C and Python are competitors because they are both programming languages

Except in this case, economic activity that is likely to occur on Polkadot or other chains (especially early on) is activity which might have otherwise occurred on Ethereum.  There is a chance that Polkadot productively increases the size of the pie for everyone with incredible and unique capability which makes the whole blockchain space more useful in ways that Ethereum alone could not have, but right now, I'm not seeing it.  If you have concrete examples of what this may look like, I'd be interested to hear them (especially use cases which could not be delivered as Ethereum L2 or under Eth 2.0).

> Healthy Ethereum means that dapps that decide that EVM or eWasm and gas prices for normal operations are too much of a constraint, and would rather have their own chain with their own runtime logic can build a Polkadot parachain, while still being able to interact with existing and future dapps built on Ethereum.

Why not just use Ethereum L2 then?  Or even build a product on top of an Ethereum L2, like many of the dapps launching on Loom's PlasmaChain?  Some of these L2 projects are launching with their own consensus mechanisms (like DPoS).

> Polkadot is not going to replace Ethereum, it's whole mission is to connect the ecosystem, not fragment it.

By creating conditions which encourage development on other chains (you don't know in what ways they will do so) before Eth 2.0 launches, Polkadot will be doing exactly that (i.e., fragmenting it).  Whether that is Polkadot's intent is not something I can evaluate, or even care about.

*Finally, I can't evaluate the intent of any project or person in this space.*  Those things can change over time in ways which I cannot discern or predict.

Then all these chains would have access to the Ethereum chain so you could have cross chain smart contract dependencies for a chain that doesn't natively support smart contracts.

The day that Metamask finally released hardware wallet support was huge, because you could finally interact with dapps from your Ledger/Trezor wallets without trying to sync out a full node and run an Ethereum-specific browser.

&nbsp;

Think about that. Metamask (as far as I know) is literally the only solution here, and they're not even a part of the core Ethereum project. There's no alternatives. It took them a very long time to add hardware wallet support, and these features are critical for making the dapps usable.

**Do you think it's a mistake that Maker DAO has exploded in use and visibility recently?** Or do you think perhaps it's because a while ago it went from a software-browser-wallet being the only way to use Maker DAO changed to the situation where you could finally use your Ledger to interact and store your CDPs?

3136,"I am ""hung up"" on Ethereum being the winner because I understand the value of a network effect.  Fragmenting activity among many public chains at this stage doesn't seem particularly wise, even if there is some degree of interoperability.

Polkadot is now labeling itself as the ""foundation of a new internet.""  Ok, well, what does that leave for Ethereum, which effectively had a similar goal of being the ""world's shared computer?""  If Polkadot were to step up and say ""Ethereum will be the world's shared asset ledger and we will provide connectivity to it for private chains,"" for example, then this would reinforce a key value proposition for Ethereum.  So far, I don't see Polkadot reinforcing any of Ethereum's core value proposition.  Rather, their best claim seems to be ""you can interoperate with Ethereum when you need to but ignore it when you don't.""

You act like there is no way to achieve interoperability between private chains and Ethereum, but this is not the case.  EEA was create with the ultimate goal in mind of having private chains connect to the public chain.  Mechanisms like Plasma L2 may provide similar functionality.  And they are already creating bridges to other networks (like Loom has to Cosmos) without needed to operate as a separate L1 solution.

Total Resource Consumption = 70+(30/2)= 85 unitsTotal Resources Ready = 75/85= 82.2%Maximum Resources Not Ready = 30/85 = 17.8%This analysis is based on the fact that in a PoW network (believe it or not Ethereum is PoW) it is not the hashrate that secures the network but the resources that are being consumed do this.So, the hard decision would be about losing 17.8% of network security instead of 30%, a much easier decision to make.Obviously, it won't be that easy because this community is regularly targeted by Bitmain shill and trolls and prominent figures like Vitalik do not weigh on ProgPoW because they are busy with their ""roadmap""  and don't want any ""distraction"".

Found and patched may not *always* lead to the best outcome. There are often plenty of reasons to do a closed release for critical software in businesses that highly depend on there not to be issues (e.g. exchanges).

Fixing your issue and announcing for an upgrade is one thing, but consider the possibility that people may not be able to upgrade or miss your announcement. You mean well, I’m sure.

3556,"The easiest one is the current fact that if a contract is selfdestructed the address will never have code again. I can create a ""ERC20 burn address"" where you can send your tokens to ""burn"" them. However, I actually created them with CREATE2 which means that I can create a new contract at this address with different code - e.g. code which transfers all the tokens in the contract to my address!!

Heads up - more detailed explanation ahead.

I want to stress that creating a contract with different code is expensive. CREATE2 allows you to create a contract at an address which is /not/ dependent on the nonce of the contract as is with CREATE. In CREATE every time you construct a new contract the nonce of the contract which creates a new one is updated. Since the deployed address is hashed it is hence not possible in the future to deploy at the same address using CREATE. However, with CREATE2, this is possible. The hashing of CREATE2 takes 4 items:

0xff (a constant, reason for this is to prevent collissions between CREATE / CREATE2 contracts which would overrule ""you cannot redeploy a contract at the address which was created by CREATE) 
address(this) (the contract which is invokes this operation)
seed (this is provided by the user)
keccak256(init_code) (the hash of the code to be deployed)

From this we can see that if you deploy a CREATE2 contract with the same `init_code` and the same `seed` at the same address we get the same output of the hash (because the input is the same!). But this might look confusing - how can you actually deploy an address with different code at the same address if you have to be sure that the `init_code` is the same?

Don't forget that we can also alter storage here! What if you deploy a contract which, for example, stores the current time (now) in the storage AT the constructor? Then if we redeploy the contract we suddenly have a different initial value at this storage slot! And to deploy actual different runtime bytecode we have to know how code is actually deposited at an address. If you CALL to a contract you can read the return value. In CREATE, the ""return value"" of this CALL-like operation is deposited at this address. But since ""return value"" is read from memory this means that we can alter the memory and then return that instead! A simple example to actually deploy different runtime bytecode (which is expensive) is to store the `bytes public runtimeBytecode` at a different contract. Then in the constructor of the CREATE2 contract we call into this contract to retrieve `runtimeBytecode` and actually put this on the returnvalue of the CREATE2 call which means different code is deposited!

However, you can check the runtime bytecode from other contracts via (currently) `extcodecopy` (which copies specific runtime code (or all) from the target contract) or `extcodehash` (which returns the hash of the runtime bytecode). It is obvious that via `extcodehash` we can always verify that runtime bytecode is correct. However, there is no way to verify that nothing fancy happened in the constructor code. Another good example of an attack is a multisig wallet which gets deployed. We can check the runtime bytecode and see that this is indeed a normal multisigwallet. However, in the constructor we can do a fancy trick where we change the owners of the multisigwallet - e.g. where we first had 3 owners and 2 confirmations we now have only one owner! There is hence no way to check this externally.

I don't think you can slice storage quite that finely. Pretty sure you need the contract's entire state, or at least a significant chunk of it.

Yes you can. A full node can provide the merkle proof of a single storage slot to a light client trivially. If a light client had to fetch a contract's entire state every time it requested a slot, erc20 tokens alone would require fetching 10s of thousands of storage slots.

Main reason is as implementors we jumped the gun, the specification is not finished and thus it seems like progress is moving slowly.

In PoW to even play the game you have to spend money up front, and if you are honest then you a get reward that may exceed the upfront cost - if you play by your own rules, you can't realise the reward. There's a whole bunch of different ways that a protocol running PoW or PoS could be set up - but PoW variants come down to different mathematical equations and the cost of hardware to run them. PoS variants have a lot more room to move - the reason that ETH 2.0 PoS has taken so long, is that your friendly ETH researchers and developers know that all of the PoS flavours to date make compromises and assumptions - and the ask is to have something new/more rigorously designed.

3739,"I think you are confusing a few different consensus mechanisms with DPoS. 

Delegated Proof of Stake reaches consensus through voting and reaching quorum. If you are not online or informed to vote, you can delegate your vote to someone else to vote for you. EOS, Lisk, Ark, and Nano use this. In Nano’s case, representitives only have very limited power to vote on double-spent, and receive no monetary incentives (just like Bitcoin nodes). Therefore it doesn’t have the cartel problems that other DPoS coins have. You can see that DPoS is not inherently centralized. It depends on the cryptoeconomic design.

Dash uses masternodes and miners. There are no votes involved in the consensus process from non-masternode participants and therefore is not DPoS. Neo uses federated BFT. Correct me if I’m wrong, I think Stellar also uses some version of BFT. Again, no votes from regular users involved.

the public DFinity sale was done at an effective pro rata share of tokens (and keeps 25% of all DFNs), and the vc sale they did at a higher valuation of DFNs so the public probably own more tokens than the vc's, so far at least.

as for the question of which is more advanced, DFinity started out originally as a fork of Ethereum as its base layer, and then spent a few years upgrading it to be more powerful and higher performant, so it seems likely that at the moment DFinity eventually ships, it will be an upgrade over ethereum as it stands today.   Hopefully Ethereum will catch up and surpass with Serenity, though that isnt certain how long it'll take.

Therefore, I think it would be unfair to extrapolate observations from politics to the limited role that Nano reps play. Your point about anti-sybil is valid but there are ways to prevent that off-chain. I agree with Vitalik that not everything needs to be solved on-chain.

EOS is limited to 21 block producers, baking in Tezos is limited only by the necessity to own 1 roll (currently 10,000 Tez). There’s already a vote being debated on whether to reduce the minimum roll size from 10,000 to 8,000 Tezos per roll. And, it should come down over time. 

Currently I believe that the network can support a theoretical 80,000 individual solo bakers (1 roll per baker). 

Tez also does not have a capped token supply as each block rewards 16 XTZ and 2 Tez per Endorser. If bakers or delegator choose to sell their rewards, these coins will enter the hands of new owners whom can solo-bake / validate once they get enough for a roll. 

So really, it’s not exactly correct to call Tezos DPOS the same way you would EOS, Cardano, Cosmos, etcetera.

You see, if you transfer an ERC20 token you (the user) has to send a transaction directly to the ERC20 token contract. Now let's say you want to trade this token on a DEX (another contract). To let both the transfer and the trade happen in the same transaction this means that the ERC20 transfer has to call into the DEX in order to transfer tokens AND trade at the same time. It is not possible to pack two of these operations in the same transaction (where transaction is when metamask pops up and wants you to confirm a transaction).

ERC20 token contract do not, by specification, call into other contracts. However, [ERC223 tokens](https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard) do! If you transfer tokens to a contract (the DEX, for example), then it calls `function tokenFallback(address _from, uint _value, bytes _data)` where `_from` is the person sending the tokens (you). To include data like the price you want to sell your tokens for and the type of token you want to trade for can be put into `_data`. Of course, `_value` is the amount of tokens transferred. This calls into the DEX and will create an order for you / fill an order!

3882,"I would take a look at how Ampleforth (formerly known as Fragments) does stability with their token. From my understanding, most token contracts are just a record of what addresses have how many tokens, and that value is defined as a variable in the contract. I think what they did is added an extra multiplier as a variable and the final product from how many tokens you have and/or total supply and the multiplier is what you are able to transact with. i.e. if the multiplier was 1 when you first created and distributed your token, and you increase it to 1.5, every wallet would have 1.5 times as many tokens in their wallets. You would do the same to deflate the value - decrease the multiplier. You could control that multiplier via a price feed of your token from other exchanges so that you wouldnt need to change it manually.

I wish you would have written this article differently, Jason. First, people should have a much better idea of the specific *way* that the init code has to work for this to happen. The whole point of CREATE2 is that the contract can be authenticated against the address, which requires *looking at the init code*. In other words, the init code is the real source code the address is committed to. If anything it is *easier* for websites, users, etc. to verify an init code against a CREATE2 address than it is to verify source code against deployed bytecode under CREATE, for exactly the same reason as the issue you point out here: possible indeterminacy in init code.

It’s not just you, but I am very concerned with this larger trend of thinking that low level technical specifications are always the best way to address security issues. To me the answer to this (and several  related problems) is much simpler: users/websites/etc. need to be verifying *init* code, not just bytecode. I also really wish you would have included the note that virtually all L2 solutions using CREATE2 will in fact be doing just this. When we look at the overall scenarios CREATE2 enables, such as offline multisig, etc. we in fact find that verification of init code in a non-state-dependent way is critical to *all of them* already. So given that the whole point of this EIP is to allow init codes to be verified noninteractively, I actually see CREATE2 as a substantial **improvement** in code accountability, not a threat to it. No matter how you design CREATE2 you will have to teach users and developers that init code is part of source code *anyways*.  Seems to me a very good argument for using the same way of tackling  “wild magic” contracts from a security perspective. Indeterminacy in init code needs to be viewed the same way as indeterminacy in normal code, via DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE. And if you think that indeterminacy is important to have readers know, assert an invariant about it or something.",19-02-14-07-43,17,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg,3887,0.066,0.0,0.934,-0.228,21

3894,"Mostly, yes.  Sorry I missed this; like I said, too many platforms going on.  After further examination I would also add that there are plenty of ways to audit even CREATE'd contracts in state-accessible contexts post-CREATE2.  You can statically check if contracts contain a selfdestruct or a DELEGATECALL/CALLCODE (the latter should probably mean a warning in general as it presents the same attack surface).  And even if it does all you need is one ancestor without a selfdestruct (including via DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE) to be fully assured, and most contracts do not have a self-destruct (all of which is statically checkable). Alternatively a single create2 ancestor with a verified-deterministic init code is also sufficient, or creation directly from an EOA (as most contracts are). Lots of websites, tools etc. can check this in state-accessible contexts. This isn't going to be some kind of apocalypse of bugs.  This is a really niche issue.

I didn't say it explicitly earlier, but I am strongly opposed to removing CREATE2 from Constantinople. It's definitely a design goal of lower level changes to help reduce the risk of people getting taken advantage of, but crippling a whole architecture over something that can be solved at a higher level is very wrong.  Ethereum is still very clearly in open beta. I can trivially write weird contracts that will break if *anything* in the network changes.  If an empirical estimate actually showed significant levels of contracts vulnerable to this it would be one thing.  But there's no such thing as an architecture that prevents user confusion.  Every single breaking change is an opportunity for assumptions to be wrong.  But unless that raises the risk significantly above the background rate the increased *benefits* of CREATE2 for verification are much stronger than the risks in my opinion.  I'd also be very curious to hear how you would solve the CREATE under CREATE2 issue without seriously bloating the trie.  Because if there isn't a good solution anyways (and CREATE actually makes this issue quite thorny with its stupid statefulness assumptions) then delaying the introduction is pointless.  The sooner people can switch away from CREATE2 the less risk users will be exposed to.  As it is I have definitely seen attacks in the wild that rely on the non-determinism of CREATE, so I wouldn't say at all that holding off on CREATE2 is risk free for users either.",19-02-14-07-43,5,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg,3894,0.21600000000000003,0.158,0.627,-0.5106,21
3895,"I'm not expecting normal users to understand this.  I assume people talking about whether this is worth pulling from Constantinople are devs deep in this, and that even most devs don't need to worry about this *at all*.  For context almost none of this will come up at all in a normal dev pipeline, where people aren't writing weird custom init code themselves.  You have to be really deep for this to affect you, and even then the risk is very similar to any contract having DELEGATECALL in it, which is very common today.  The only impact on end users is how certain ""contract verification"" tools will work under the hood. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect someone writing a contract verification tool to be aware of these edge cases.  There are actually already several similar edge cases around how factories work with CREATE, for example, that such tools need to handle today.

And the Parity thing just has no legs at all.  For context I have been a vocal opponent of any Parity restoration scheme ever since it happened, and I really shouldn't even need to say that because it would take so many steps to connect this topic to that. But for those who care, although I haven't examined the specific Parity wallet init chain I am highly doubtful that any combination of these changes would allow a redeployment of the Parity wallet to the same address.  All these new schemes create new addresses, all locked to specific init codes. They don't let you change old contracts unless there was some weird DELEGATECALL backdoor in an earlier contract which you can still repoint to new redeploying functionality,PLUS having all intermediate children being selfdestructible so you can remove them before redeploying them.  I'll happily go on record estimating that I don't presently think even the weird future 2.0 stuff combined with this would allow the re-initialization of the Parity contract at the same address. Specifically I highly doubt that the parent contract which initially deployed the Parity contract is itself destructible, or that any sequence of destructible parents leads to something with a re-keyable DELEGATECALL just sitting in it.

Yup, I believe all of these are covered in the original post. The biggest problem is when people don't even know that re-deploying is a possibility.

Come on, this is a solved problem in upgradeable distributed systems design. You require that upgradeable routines (contracts in this case) are called with a version parameter passed by the user, and which matches the version in execution.  That way there is an interlock where the caller explicitly has to agree to invoke the upgraded function in order to be served the upgraded functionality.    

You can, if you want, create an ""any version"" parameter (e.g. version 0 = all versions) that can be passed for full forwards-compatibility, but this requires *TRUST*.

You have to choose whether you are developing a system in which there is trust - in which case unconstrained upgrades are easy and seamless - or lack of trust - in which case upgrades need to be explicit and agreed.   

But you can't say you are developing a platform that does not require trust, and then embed capabilities that assume trust.  That's just a haven for exploits.

Plasma group has a beta release public testnet version in two to three months. It doesn't have a mechanism like a watcher which OMG is working towards. But it supports atomic swaps which are needed to build a DEX.

Why is it that OMG is taking so much time for a public testnet?

Check out @kelvinfichter’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1091761057142517760?s=09

It’s not production quality yet, but we wanted to give people the tools to start playing with it. That way we can already have people using it once it moves into production. There’s a lot of open work for people to help out on and more issues will pop up in the next few days :-)

So, the recent testnet release by Plasma group is not a production version. 

Likewise the LeapDAO testnet release is also an early release and not a production release.

It is just that OmiseGO kept early releases internal and is choosing to do a production version for the external testnet release. This surely has it's advantages. In this context it would help to again read OmiseGO's reply given below

We extend our congratulations to the LeapDAO team, who were incubated by our partner Status, for bringing a public testnet online. This isn’t a race; everyone who is working on plasma brings something different to the table and everyone takes a different approach. LeapDAO chose to deploy a public testnet at a relatively early phase of development; OmiseGO have thus far chosen to keep our OMG testnet internal in order to publicly deploy something more polished and stable. We have also been running our release candidates against Rinkeby since December. The means of deploying the testnet are available in the form of the child chain server and watcher, which anyone can deploy - and which we have deployed in multiple iterations, but we have so far not opened those iterations to the public. We won’t argue that either approach is correct or incorrect; just different.

As for whether LeapDAO has appropriated the work of the OmiseGO team in some way, here’s how we understand it: although LeapDAO started from the MoreVP design proposed by Kelvin Fichter and Ben Jones with help from a motley crew of Ethereum community members, they did not fork OmiseGO’s code.

There have already been some good analyses of the differences between LeapDAO’s plasma and OMG plasma in this sub. We’re going to refrain from commenting in further technical detail until we have a better understanding of LeapDAO’s work thus far; we look forward to seeing more thorough documentation as it becomes available.

With this product release, the company realizes a major technological achievement which represents the industry’s first decentralized blockchain application powered by geospatial technology.

The COIN app will allow users in proximity of any activated Geomining Kit to collect digital assets in exchange for providing location-based data to the XYO network. These digital assets can then be withdrawn as XYO once a minimum amount is reached.

“Today is a huge day for our geomining community, and we couldn’t wait to roll out the first release of our app to our global family of Geominers,” said Scott Scheper, XYO Co-Founder and CMO. “COIN is the official app to earn XYO by geomining. Geominers explore the world around them, ‘mine’ real-world locations on a map, and collect a real bounty – XYO tokens.

4044,"Sorry, I think you're missing the point. Hopefully I can try to explain. There is one single person who voted no who has a massive amount of ETH (a whale). They voted no because the concept of this sort of vote is actually really questionable. All anyone needs is another single whale to vote yes. In essence, anyone with a lot of coin can influence the vote, but that doesn't mean the technology isn't sound or needed. It is really a shame this vote was created at all. It effectively serves no real purpose other than to split the community down a line that is arbitrary.

&#x200B;

The fact is that ethash (the current PoW) has worked well for 4+ years, but chip technology has caught up and the threat of ASICs are real. If ETH wants to stay GPU centric, then something will need to change in order to ensure that. Having ASICs control the network is something that the ETH community has been fighting against since day one.

&#x200B;

There is a major issue on the network right now. The amount of hashrate going to ETH is dropping. So much so that it lower than 51% of its all time high. This means that there is potentially enough hashrate out there to attack the network. It is an edge case, but stranger things have happened in the crypto world. With the lowered price of ETH, there is also lower profitability. When Constantinople hits, it will magnify this issue because profitability will be cut by 1/3. Unless the price goes up, there is a real risk of enough GPUs leaving the network that ASICs will be the only thing left.

&#x200B;

PoS isn't coming to mainnet for years. It is just taking an extra ordinate amount of time to complete because it is extremely complicated and nobody wants to risk the billions of $'s of value on the network today. PoW isn't going away for years after that as they will both run in parallel. PoS is not going to magically fix everything over night, so it isn't really even part of the discussion at this point.  


Holders of coin should really be voting to protect their investment, not influence the vote because they feel the vote itself is invalid. ProgPoW, is the best hope at doing that right now. Assuming it passes all the technical analysis. Remember that unless someone spends another year coming up with something else, there isn't much else out there to solve the issue. Not to be dire, because we probably have 6-12 months, but time is running out and that can't be ignored. It would be irresponsible to not try to do something.

1. Gap <= 1.5x , hence progpow adoption guarantees that GPUs remain viable until the switch to PoS.
2. Gap >= 3x, hence replacing ethash by progpow is mostly futile.

Nvidia and AMD have both publicly stated, they don't care about cryptocurrency and the goings on. They both reaped the rewards in 2017/2018, however Nvidia suffered from overproduction of 1000 series and releasing the 2000 series which hurt them far more than AMD who, still is limping on the RX 500 series for midrange.

>**written guarantee from Nvidia to not favor selected miners with secret optimizations or special chip deals, and only sell to all miners on an egalitarian basis through distributors**.

&#x200B;

There extremely small teams I'm sure on both sides involved with blockchains, none care about making any one crypto GPU-mineable. Your asking for the impossible and improbable. Nvidia isn't going to release some statement on ProgPoW.

&#x200B;

Nvidia does well in ProgPoW so we should be careful about Ohgodagirl and IfdefElse ""back-door deals""

That's a totally a Ad Hominem Fallacy. So can we get the same thing for X16R? Zhash? GRIN? Their teams have back-door deals with massive nvidia mining farms? Nvidia dominates many algorithms already because of there much more efficient architecture and CUDA implementation in low-level software rather than using OPENCL.

&#x200B;

There's thousands of AMD farms, far more than Nvidia's. Going off ETHOS own page RX470's are top cards used, then RX480s, and lower on the rung is the P106/104/P102 cards.  I would say AMD OEMs were giving the special treatment to many larger farms rather than individual miners during the low-stock period. Nvidia was extremely late to that game and barely reaped any rewards. Changing the algorithm to ProgPoW isn't magically going to make Nvidia billions of dollars because of sales of GPUs. All it's going to do right now is make GPU-mining for Ethereum viable for another year or two... at best.

&#x200B;

IMHO GRIN would be a better focus for your attention to create and ASIC for. GRIN is stated to become an ASIC-Algorithm and throwing off GPU miners. It's ironically an Nvidia dominated Algorithm right now btw.

&#x200B;

I do have an honest question.

Theoretically, because Ethereum is built in an Difficulty bomb/iceage and say we don't move to ProgPoW. what then? How are ASIC farms going to stay profitable in that time-period? When the difficulty ticks slowly upwards. How could you sell ASICs then? Who would buy? There's no chances of quick ROIs on Ethereum. It's not built like other cryptos.

ASICs then would flood other Eth-hash networks until the profitability of them is barely anything. Most would be sold for nil or dumped in land-fills because they are not useful for anything else. The idea that you're going to walk graciously away is stupid. You're investing millions into manufacture and engineering these ASICs. You can recoup maybe your initial investment selling/selfish mining, but in one or two years its going to be basically be nothing.

So far, there are no facts that ""asics are bad' as an a-priori statement.  Just bad if they represent a centralizing function... but if that's bad, then PoS sucks... so... not bad, a-priori.   There are also no facts that suggest ASICs are prevalent.  In fact, everything triangulates to the fact that they are an irrelevant contributor to current hashpower, and subject to being overtaken by tweaking of commodity GPUs (which are also ASICs).  Finally, the stated intention of Ethereum is to move to PoS, in which all mining is irrelevant, and nobody's having the discussion to ditch PoS. 

Thus, all this fuss about an ASIC resistant algorithm is about something that nobody can prove is bad, against something nobody can prove exists, for a purpose everyone agrees is ultimately irrelevant.

4094,">Protecting a multi-million dollar investment is not tribalism. 

It's actually the whole point of a tribe:  protecting what is inside whatever binds the tribe together, against the forces outside the tribe.    You may not see it as such, but there is very clearly a ""GPU"" tribe doing its best to diss the ASIC tribe, and vice versa.  It may not be evident from inside one of the tribes, but it sure as heck is evident from the sidelines.

As far as my point about inevitability of hardware obsolescence:  

>I actually attempted to make the point contrary to this.  

And then you go on to describe which parts of hardware obsolescence you have no objection against, while mounting an argument that is entirely against hardware (GPU) obsolescence. 

>New hardware with new tech such as GDDR6 or HBM3 will, and should, outperform older inferior hardware, this comes with a price tag. What will not happen is that GDDR5 will outperform GDDR5 or $500 hardware will not outperform $1000 hardware. It will not matter what kind of boards and enclosures you package this silicon in. 

It's selective at best and specious logic.  Why are you OK with $1000 hardware outperforming $500 hardware without being OK that maybe the $500 difference in hardware cost could in fact be an ASIC??

Your argument is not standing on firm principles here, because you are being selective in your position. 

Special purpose technology is often beneficial, although it almost always hurts the incumbent ecosystem.    Automobiles are very custom engines, with the sole purpose of taking people from point A to point B.  Back in the days of horses, we also had engines, and we also had the entire carriage industry up in arms against these horseless carriages, because their investment in horses and barns was about to be made obsolete.  The result of active lobbying by horse-cart industry includes laws to have people walk in front of cars. This had the intended consequence of making cars more expensive and less practical, versus the espoused consequence of being safer.  But it's patently ludicrous, in hindsight.

I'm not just picking one example.  Personal computers were attacked by the mainframe industry. ATMs really messed up the lives and occupations of millions of tellers. The Internet destroyed ""long distance minutes"" as a business. There are millions of miles of perfectly good copper wire in the ground to every house in the US... rotting.... because we have wireless phones instead...  

Innovation happens and special purpose devices - whether ASIC or not - intervene and render trillions of dollars of capital obsolete.  GPUs occupy no special pedestal in technical Darwinism, and it is absurd to treat them as some sacrosanct technology.  Regardless of how loud the priests of the GPU tribe are shouting.   

Cryptocurrency itself is disrupting banks, and it's deliciously ironic that a faction within a disruptive technology movement is up in arms against an internal disruption of its own technology!

You talk smart, surely you understand that the W in Proof of Work is measured by the energy spent on it.  If you're spending less energy, you're working less.  Each time energy is saved, more devices are added, difficulty goes up and no extra security or energy savings was accomplished.

But you are pro-ProgPOW.  The only purpose of ProgPOW is to be anti-asic.  It has no other value.  I assumed your stance pro-ProgPOW was aligned with its only purpose.   Apologies if i got that wrong, but if you aren't pro-GPU then what the heck is the point of being pro-progPOW?  Make-work?

>I would like to see other PoW algorithms adopt ProgPoW 

Why?  It's just an algorithm.  How about if they use ETHHash? Personally, I would prefer if ETHHash becomes as prevalent as 802.11, which only occurred when there were chips for that. Why not have chips for ETHHash and drive it into everything?   Why should everything come with a GPU and only a GPU and never evolve past that?  Unless of course one is a member of tribe-GPU, in which case totally understandable. 

I want the same thing.  I am arguing from the basis of history which suggests that the fastest path to ubiquity is to embed functionality in cheap silicon, and not entrench it in expensive $500-a-pop GPUs. 

Proprietary advantage is not how the endgame emerges.   Otherwise, Texas Instruments would own the entire PC market.  And they don't. 

>I care about making the hash as decentralized as it can be or crypto assets have no value to me.

Me too.  But let's take that apart.

First, I detect ZERO evidence that ASICs are a cause of centralization.  In fact, although they are widely assumed to exist, all evidence requires that they are remarkably broadly distributed, and therefore just as benignly centralizing as GPUs.  Mining farms are *far* more of a centralizing force than ""ASICs"", and we don't seem to have anyone railing against these.

Second, ""*making the hash as decentralized as it can be*"" - that doesn't have to be anti-ASIC on an a-priori basis.  Bitcoin seems to be surviving (in fact dominating) and it's algorithm is completely dominated by ASIC.  So you are arguing a non-sequitor in the face of the only evidence that exists. Diverting ETH Devs to implement ProgPOW is taking away resources from usable applications, from PoS, and from all kinds of things.  It's a side-show to the main event.

>surely you understand that the W in Proof of Work is measured by the energy spent on it. 

No, I do not understand this, because it is wrong.  The ""W"" in proof of work is measured in hashes per unit time.   That happens to correlate to the energy spent, but is only 1:1 between devices that have the same energy cost per hashes-per-second.  A device that generates the same number of hashes-per-second at 1/10 the energy generates the same WORK (the W), but 1/10 the energy cost.  It isn't accidental that we don't call it PoE.  

Sorry, but I am not so easily fooled.  

> Each time energy is saved, more devices are added, difficulty goes up and no extra security or energy savings was accomplished.

Again, not true.

Mining is a tournament business:  adding more miners does not increase the number of ETH that are mined, because difficulty algorithm adjusts.  It does change who gets the ETH that is mined.  When we are at equilibrium, and there is a distribution of energy-cost per unit hash-per-second, what it means is that less efficient (and costly) devices become less profitable and drop out, and more energy efficient devices take their place, and the hashpower remains constant, if the devices coming in cost the same as the devices going out.

If there is a cost advantage to the energy efficient devices, and energy is the *only* cost, then yes, the total hashpower would go up by a factor of 10 and then the ETH reward per unit energy would not change.  But since there is a capital cost of hardware that needs to also be considered, and this is non-trivial compared to the energy cost, and needs to be compensated by the ETH that is earned, the net energy cost of the same  amount of hashpower is lower.  

>Before you go on and paint me as Tribe GPU again.  

Apologies.  I wasn't talking about you per-se, but as a voice of the pro-progPOW constituency, which is dominated whether knowingly or unknowningly by the priests of the GPU tribe.  I can't tell whether you are a priest in disguise, or one of the brainwashed flock, or just someone advancing an argument that doesn't rest on the reasons they think it does.  But ""you"" is meant collectively.

4097,"The only argument to say that ProgPoW is anti-asic is that in order for an asic to be financially viable it must be able to monopolize the network hash.  If this is true, then yes, I'm anti-asic.  I do not believe this to be true (even if it is slightly true today).

ProgPoW is not a complete PoW algorithm, its a design philosophy that can be applied to any memory hard PoW algorithm.  Instead of leaving space for an inefficient arms race, it it forces the hardware to work hard.

One algo for all chains is dangerous for all but the dominant chain.  See every single 51% attack.

A measurement in hashes is meaningless, the energy consumed to solve a hash is what matters.  Go back to the principles behind Proof of Work, even before Blockchain.  Work comes at a cost, that is why we value it.  If few parties can hash the same while expending less energy their signals (hashes) are not as trustworthy because they are not expending as much energy to perform the work as the rest of the network.  If all of the network can hash more for less energy, they will keep buying devices.   Hardware is an asset, energy spent is a liability.  Hardware costs are recouped in a relatively short period of time.  See https://medium.com/@OhGodAGirl/the-problem-with-proof-of-work-da9f0512dad9

With regards to the short period of PoW left on ethereum, I am anti-asic and maybe this is where I look and sound like a duck.  The change from PoW to PoS is my reason for this.  New eth asic's are coming, it is in the interest of the companies making those asics and the purchases of them to make a fork to PoS a contentious one, whether or not they are successful will not matter for all the bad press it will cause further sullying the name of crypto.

4098,"> The only argument to say that ProgPoW is anti-asic is that in order for an asic to be financially viable it must be able to monopolize the network hash.

Wrong. In order for an ASIC to be viable it has to give miners a marginally better return on investment than mining with a GPU.  Period.  The same can be said about the next generation of GPU.  If either ultimately displace less capital-efficient mining rigs, previous generations of GPUs, whatever, that's a consequence of economic Darwninism, not an a-priori requirement for an ""ASIC"", or a ""GPU"".  

Also, ProgPOW is ""anti ASIC"" merely and precisely because it is pro ""only GPU"".  This is by design and no amount of fancy language footwork changes this fact.   If you are a member of the ""Only GPU"" tribe, then you clearly not a member of the ""something-that-isn't-a-GPU"" tribe.  Whether you admit it or not.

>Instead of leaving space for an inefficient arms race, it it forces the hardware to work hard. 

Come on, now you are just coloring inside the lines.  ProgPOW forces **GPU** hardware to work hard, and it forces anything that isn't a GPU to be exactly like a GPU if it wants to work at all.    Which is to say, it forces only GPUs.   

>The change from PoW to PoS is my reason for this. New eth asic's are coming, it is in the interest of the companies making those asics and the purchases of them to make a fork to PoS a contentious one, whether or not they are successful will not matter for all the bad press it will cause further sullying the name of crypto. 

Oh dear, it appears you haven't been paying attention.  

First, a ""fork"" to PoS isn't happening.   There is no fork, which is the elegant finesse of Shasper.   Once Constantinople goes through, everything necessary to shift to PoS can happen *WITH NO FORK*.  this is why it was so important to delay Constantinople until the miners are up against a wall.  

Second, even without ProgPOW, when ETH shifts to PoS, what precisely do you think 150 Terahash worth of GPUs are going to do?  Roll over and play dead?   We saw what 10 TH of GPUs heading over to ETH Classic did.  There already isn't enough alt-coin hashing to absorb all the GPUs on Ethereum, let alone ASICs.  That problem is already yours to navigate.  Multiplying the participants by two isn't going to make it twice as bad.

Sort of yes, and sort of no.

It is an exponential.  The effect increase by a factor of two every 100,000 blocks.  When the effect is small, say, 1/1000'th of a tick, nobody cares when it doubles to 1/500'th of a tick.   But when it gets big, from 1/4 of a tick to 1/2 of a tick, it becomes noticeable.

It's to force hard-fork upgrades, not just to PoS.

> it will make mining a block more and more difficult even without more miners joining the network to equilizate the time it takes to find a block which is supposed to be around 12 seconds.

It increases the difficulty regardless of how many miners are joining/leaving.  The point is to increase block times to infinity, making the blockchain unusable without forking it.

> The proof of stake stage is titled ""casper"" or also some people have tagged it Ethereum 2.0 and will mean at least in part, mining will take place in wallets holding over 30 or so ethereum instead of gpu and asic mining specific hardware.

""Casper"" is a protocol, or classification of protocols, not the development stage in which Ethereum implements PoS.  ETH 2.0 involves sharding, not just PoS.  Mining doesn't take place in wallets..  Wallets don't even exist to the blockchain at all.  The 30+ number is a placeholder, it may or may not be what the minimum stake is.

World's Fair is an effort to make the notion of piracy obsolete by substituting ether for ""views"" (or some other attention based metric).

After all, why should a creator ever have an incentive to restrict access to their work? Doesn't that seem inelegant?

You're not paying for access, you're paying for ownership. The fact that paying for access is the de facto source of revenue is the root problem that World's Fair is attempting to address. It's hard to wrap your mind around because [the attention economy has been around for a very long time](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/whitepaper#application-bypassing-attention-economy)",19-02-11-14-17,1,695,lovvtide,apbx7x,4545,0.358,0.225,0.41700000000000004,-0.3818,53

4547,"Yes, that's the trouble isn't it? During development I was surprised there there didn't seem to be a good source of data for vetted beneficiaries, so I started creating one. It's not just for World's Fair—any app can use this list. We're trying to be as transparent as possible so it can serve as a resource for the community and other developers. So far there's 13 beneficiaries, and is available [from the API](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/docs#web-beneficiary-list), as well as [on Github](https://github.com/lovvtide/worldsfair/blob/master/BENEFICIARIES.json).

World's Fair contract allows assets to name any address they want as beneficiary, or even to not name a beneficiary at all. Having a fake/scammy beneficiary address is a bad look for an asset, and so there does exist some incentive on the author's part to pick a legitimate one, if only to avoid dissuading investment (the same goes for supporters who are hoping to resell their shares at some point).

Since there's no practical way to enforce a whitelist at the contract level, for the time being we're taking this centralized approach of curating the whitelist. [From the whitepaper](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/whitepaper#implementation-beneficiary-whitelist):

> Admittedly, this is a centralized solution—although it's not as bad as it seems. Each entry on the whitelist includes the name of the charitable organization, their main website, and the url of the specific page where the donation address is listed. Even so, World's Fair allows authors to name other addresses too, which, if not included in the whitelist, show up as ""Unknown Beneficiary"" on the official front end. Users are free to search that address for themselves to decide if it's legitimate. Only in cases where a beneficiary is clearly not a real charity will we take the step of blacklisting that address. In time, we'd like to move towards a more decentralized solution by involving the community in the effort to compile and curate a large crowd-sourced list of known charities that are capable of accepting Ethereum donations. Finally, you don't have to trust the World's Fair admins: this is a completely open source project, so anyone could in principle create their own frontend and their own beneficiary whitelist/blacklist if they were unsatisfied with the editorial policy.

By the way, if someone wants to make a crypto version of Charity Navigator, that'd be awesome! It could be like a non-profit org that helps onboard established charities by getting them set up with an Ethereum address. Or something like that.

As far as a long term, scalable, and fully decentralized solution, here's what I'm thinking: You could create ""multi-beneficiary"" contracts that would act as an intermediary to receive donations and then subsequently disburse the funds to multiple donation addresses under some form of democratic governance. I don't know exactly how that would work, it could be as simple as a contract where a majority vote from existing addresses in the beneficiary contract can remove other members. Having a way for bad actors (or even just addresses with lost/compromised keys) to be ""voted off the island"" would be very useful.

This is probably the #1 thing idea I'm excited about and hoping to get the community's help with during the testnet phase of World's Fair, because it's a *real problem*. If decentralized/democratic solution could be successfully implemented, it would be an incredible demonstration of Ethereum's capabilities.

4613,"Garoththorp, ERC-1155 fixes the rigid limitations of both token standards.

ERC-20 and ERC-721 are limited to describing a single token type that's either fungible or non-fungible, and strictly one type per contract. ERC-1155 shifts the token type from being the contract address to the token\_id.

I'm sure you can summon some imagination to realize that multiple token types managed by a single smart contract with common rules and permissions are vastly more flexible than the existing alternatives (Cloning the same program out endlessly, and siloing each individual token type in separate smart contracts)

* Simple and flexible atomic trades between different token types on-chain and off-chain.
* Batch transfers require one transaction instead of 1+(n token approvals)
* ""Programmable Money"" is a lot more powerful if the ""program"" can access multiple token types natively.
* Defining and minting new token types is more logical in ERC-1155, only storing the minimal difference between each unique token.
* No need to do cross-contract calls for basic functionality.

Secondly, you bring out a red herring argument that 20/721 standards are already being used in the ecosystem. Should the existence of some software ever stop the need for improvement? The old two standards are locked and not receiving further updates.

This is conventional wisdom, but it doesn't rest on much.

It assumes too many things to be useful in any reasonable timeframe.  

First, the total ""supply""/""demand"" of ETH that trades in a day is about 100x the amount mined in a day, so the maximum factor by which the ~~ice age~~ issuance reduction can possibly impact a supply/demand equation is about 1/3 of 1%.  ETH is not sufficiently elastic that this represents a significant price-shifting influence.

Second, boats float upon the tide, and the biggest determinant in the price of ETH is the price of BTC, which is entirely decoupled from how many ETH are mined on a daily basis. 

Third, the ETH that circulates is a very small fraction of the ETH that exists.  A huge chunk of ETH hasn't really moved since the original distribution.   These illiquid reservoirs represent several years of 100% of the current mining rewards.

Finally, the utility of ETH is for paying ""gas"".  Since an entire block's worth of transaction uses about 0.03 ETH in gas, the current supply of ETH (about 100M) represents about 3 billion blocks worth of transactions - or enough to power ETH for more than the next ~~century~~ millennium, and that's if all gas is only used once.  Which it isn't.  In other words, there is so much supply of gas that it cannot possibly be consumed by demand in the lifetime of ETH.  If you believe in the law of supply and demand, then it is difficult not to believe in the price of gas going ultimately to zero, and taking the price of ETH with it.  The only saving grace is speculation, which as you can plainly see from the price of ETh, completely dominates the price of ETH.

Speculation has nothing to do with how many ETH are mined in a day, as anyone can plainly see.

But this is trivially solvable with some simple patterns.  I gave an example of one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aosaly/create2_eip_vulnerability_questions/eg9n3xk/?context=3).  You can solve this with the existing set of opcodes, which makes this an insufficient reason to introduce a new one alone.

I don't see why this would ever need to be relevant?  With the same pattern outlined above, you *could* have two people agree on how to treat the address, because they've created a contract that can *only* create the agreed upon contract, and they can each derive its address from the address of said generator.

> With create2, the address is independent of nonce, but tied to the code. That means you can ensure the contract will be deployed at a particular address without concern for nonce, and that it will have a particular behavior because the address depends on the code.

But this instead introduces the edge case wherein different code can be deployed at that same address in opaque ways.  `init_code` might be static, but there's nothing stopping it from doing a dynamic lookup for the code.  So not only does this not solve the problem you're putting forth, it actually makes it worse.

So, again, none of the scenarios put forth are either problems that cannot already be solved with the existing code set.  `create2` doesn't provide a solution to a problem that cannot be solved without it--and it also introduces additional edge cases that can lead to bad behavior.

4766,Yeah #4 not an issue. My view is this doesn't warrant a delay. Not many contracts use selfdestruct anyway and I see this change as making it even rarer (as auditing contracts with selfdestruct will be tricky) but this is balanced by the additional functionality provided by CREATE2 (and not delaying the fork again) which IMO are more important.

4768,"As I understand it, the primary goal is to reduce costs for certain types of state channel implementations.

Right now you can use state channels where you deploy a contract, two parties fund it, and each signs a message describing everyone's balance. They can then move assets around within the state channel by having every member of the state channel sign a message describing everyone's updated balances. If everyone agrees to close out the state channel, everyone can sign one last message, submit it to the contract, and everyone gets paid out. If one or more individuals choose not to cooperate with settling the state channel, any individual can submit the last message signed by the whole group, then after a period of time (if nobody produces a more recent message signed by the whole group) the contract will pay everyone according to the last message.

Right now to create a state channel the contract has to actually be deployed. With create2, the members of a state channel could agree to a specific contract, fund the address it will eventually be deployed to, and run the state channel as though the contract exists. If everyone agrees to settle the state channel, you could deploy the contract and in the same transaction settle it, then have the contract selfdestruct. The contract didn't need to exist for a whole transaction, and since the selfdestruct refunded part of the gas for the creation of the contract the overall cost of the state channel was very low. If you have someone refusing to cooperate, any individual could deploy the contract to handle the state channel settlement process, and gas ends up costing what it would have cost if you had deployed the state channel conventionally. 

You can take this a step further with another layer of abstraction. A larger group of people agrees to a state channel factory contract. All participants fund the state channel factory, and sign messages that designate the creation of specific state channels, indicating how each state channel is to be funded by the state channel factory. Then, the participants in an individual state channel can send funds back and forth to each other as though their state channel contract exists, even though the factory that will eventually create their state channel doesn't exist yet (and within a state channel, signatures are only required by the participants of the state channel, not the state channel factory). Periodically, the state channels that will be generated by the state channel factory can be rebalanced, so if two people have stopped transacting with each other frequently and would rather transact with other people who belong to the state channel factory, so long as they can get signatures from all participants in the state channel factory the state channels can be rebalanced *without any transactions on chain*. The contract for the state channel that got closed never gets created on chain, but it could have been if any member of the state channel factory had ceased participating. If everyone in the state channel factory agrees to close their state channels at the same time, they can sign a message to settle and pay out every account their balances without ever actually creating *any* of the the state channel contracts (just the factory contract). But if anyone refuses to cooperate, you can commit the last message everyone signed to create all the individual state channels it described, then the members of each of those state channels can choose to continue transaction on their state channel, or settle the state channels and reclaim their funds.

I think that's where the real power of create2 lies. You can have multiple layers of contracts that would be created if people cease cooperating, but so long as everyone cooperates you can keep a lot of transactions from ever hitting the chain, and a lot of contracts from ever being created.",19-02-10-00-24,2,2774,AusIV,aosaly,4768,0.16699999999999998,0.0,0.833,-0.7351,82

4808,"UPD:

Based on the comments received let me bring the discussion one level up and argue that:

\- having escrow as a standard protocol let the parties involved create their own net of escrows, which the parties compile at will.   
Escrow1 - swap the actual values between Alis and Bob as per the conditions they have agreed upon.  
Escrow2, 3.... etc,  - services, which would facilitate the swap all the way through. 

You can rent out your bungalow through Escrow1 and have Escrow2 service in it (e.g. security checks) and Escrow2 (cleaning services). Escrow3 (notary services) ... and all the escrow you compile at will as Lego pieces.  

Even further - having the ability to escrow opens totally new way of thinking. 

For example I could now lock my private keys to the conditions i create myself. Say, you go on vacation and worry about your 24 words being left in your house. No problem, because you can now lock the ability to restore it for... say a month, or lock it to your Digi-ID only by using an escrow of a notary service to prove your identity over a short Skype video call, let's call it ""ID CALL"". The beauty of this is that whoever you call to ID yourself would only perform a function that you have setup.  The ID CALL with a notary person will only ID yourself and, say, a secret phrase that you had specified in the conditions of this particular notary escrow. This way the notary won't even know what this particular ID CALL is tied up to - he or she or they would only perform one simple specific task .... nothing more. 

This will decentralize every step of the whole process (escrow1->escrow2->escrow3->..... etc) without compromising the quality of the whole deal. Each party would simply following their conditions of their escrow only, without even knowing what the whole, the general escrow is all about. 

Same with fiat money (while it's still around). I guess in future the role of banks will be reduced and they will only be happy to be providing such a escrow to, say, confirm that the money actually arrived on you account... but then again - it is you now who would be setting the rules, not them.

4859,"The project isn't just about accepting crypto for payments, that could be done with a central portal that converts and pays bills. I linked to a really brief intro the project I wrote up above [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GridPlus/comments/ad5yyz/welcome_to_rgridplus_introduction_overview_links/) but [their main site](https://gridplus.io/) is probably the best jumping off point.

So, why crypto? Most of the reason is what's going on under the hood which consumers don't have to understand or care about - it lets them circumvent expensive legacy payment systems. Short time interval payments via payment channel means the company isn't accruing liabilities for customer debts and chasing bad debt expense which is a costly part of running a traditional utility. The Lattice1 is linked to customers' smart meters via Zigbee and is actively searching for and selecting the best wholesale rates and applying a fixed markup, which is far cheaper for consumers than traditional fixed rate plans which typically build in as much as 100% markup to cover admin costs and cover their profit margin in case of wholesale rate fluctuations.

So the value proposition is straight forward: what they're doing behind the scenes saves money and that's all a consumer has to care about. A regular customer just needs to plug in the box, link up their phone's payment app, and they're good to go.

And yes, they will be selling cheap traditional plans to customers that don't have internet access, because if they're already a licensed retail electricity provider, why not get that additional revenue if they can beat incumbent firms on pricing?

In terms of energy, The Lattice1 will do a lot more than just pass through cheap wholesale rates - optimizing home power consumption via connected devices and creating passive income streams if the household or business has solar and/or a home battery.

To facilitate all this they built the first next gen hardware wallet from the ground up. Among many other things, it facilitates things like subscriptions and permissioned payments, so, coupled with all of its connectivity the platform will enable crypto based micropayments with all kinds of connected devices.

Grid+ is also a trojan horse for real world crypto usage. Electricity customers who have never heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum will end up with these in their homes just because it saves them money, but crypto nerds end up with a hardware wallet that does far more than an old fashioned devices like a Nano X or Trezor and get a tamper-resistant crypto vault that does out of the box hardware multi-sig and more.

4904,"It's not about which individual metric but the combination and weight placed into scalability, decentralization, and security. 

Ethereum, from the start, has chosen decentralization and security. Its plan has been to backpedal to be scalable from the start.

EOS hasn't done the whole decentralization nor security things well, but has achieved better scalability. Popular opinion is that EOS and Tron are more synonymous with Cloud Computing platforms than actual blockchains for now. 

It's egregiously unfair to compare Ethereum's scalability to something like EOS for now. To put it simply, if I were in the Holocaust, I would never dare touch EOS or Tron for being the mechanisms for storing my data. It would have to be Ethereum, because it's too difficult to shut down (too decentralized, which is good).

So, any app that needs to take advantage of Finance 3.0, should be running on top of Ethereum, in anticipation for scalability changes.

Trustless also means that you don't have to trust some arbitrary institution with the power to revert your transactions at will.  Immutability and trustlessness are related, in that trustlessness is only possible if the system is immutable.

> The Ethereum blockchain, and every other blockchain, depends on the social consensus. That is how it is and will always be, regardless of the DAO fork. 

Which, by definition, means they're not trustless systems :) You have to trust social consensus.  Given the way the DAO fork played out, it's pretty easy to see how manipulable social consensus actually is.  Every democratic political system provides additional ample evidence of this.

> Even the Bitcoin blockchain turned out not to be immutable.

Except the bitcoin blockchain has always been immutable?  Yeah yeah, you'll move the goalposts and pick some bug as reason it's ""not immutable"", but there's a pretty clear difference between a system bug (i.e. an overflow), and a bug in a contract written atop an otherwise unflawed system, and then rewriting part of that system to correct the bug in the contract.

Seriously though the point is to have short term stable prices, you cant do that and appreciate in value since in order to have people take the opposite side of the trade (to short DAI while its going up and buy it back when its going down) you first need an asset that the borrowers will expect will go down relative to the collateral long term. Originally that was going to be the SDR but nobody prices things in the currency index and even though DAI is pegged to the USD there is nothing stopping MKR holders from pegging it to some other currency or index or letting it float in value but in any scenario in order to be stable it must depreciate slightly against collateral or you would not have that plunge protection of short covering.

This is routinely present in all liquid markets and the practice is a regular source of price volatility, not stability.

Another issue is this overcollateralization thing. Overcollateralizatiin in financial deals is almost exclusively reserved for typically illiquid assets which remain in debtor's possession.

Was it not in everybodys best interest to hold gbp when boe hiked the interesr rate to 18%? After all, there was nothing wrong with the uk economy, it was just the gbp that was temporarily under greater inflation pressure than dem. And it wouldn't have made much difference. But, there was this lower bound in gbp exchange rate that if breached gbp was to be forced out of erm. And that event in itself would represent a brief devaluation shock.sounds familiar? The rest was history. It wasn't Soros who pushed the boe down to its knees, it was the certainty of the events that would (and did) materialize should the lower bound of a gbp trading range fail to hold. The market simply forced gbp out of erm when Soros and others placed their bets on what were a known flaw of the peg and the expected reaction by the boe (the fear). Nobody really thought for a second that gbp would collapse into abyss forever (and it didn't), but the promise (effectively, a range peg that was NOT backed by sufficient reserves)  and what was then interpreted as a boe weakness were just too sweet of an opportunity to miss.

1) you have an additional barrier to entry in the sense that the app needs to be coin-oped using cryptocurrencies. Breaking it down further -

a) you need to convince people on the street who don't understand cryptocurrencies to accept these fancy new ""tokens"" (existing payment schemes such as credit cards have deep market penetration and do not suffer from this trust-onboarding problem)

b) you then need to convert whatever currency you have into that particular flavour of a token. Let us then assume for the sake of argument that coinbase will let you convert from and into every token (it doesn't currently, and it's unlikely to do that in the future). So then in addition to participating in the actual platform, you need to onboard (and KYC) yourself onto YET another system (existing payment channels do not have this problem).

c) what should a ride cost? is it completely arbitrary, or should those be predefined? in either case that cost in tokens needs to be translated into whatever currency the user operates in and take into account the token-currency exchange rate at the time of the trade. (Uber doesn't have this problem by design).

2) blockchains are still slow, imagine tx fees go up and you have to wait a few minutes to agree on the terms of a ride - ain't nobody got time for that.

5174,"Uber is not as centralized in the perfect sense. Each market it operates in is subject to that market's laws. In NYC, for Uber to operate they have to operate as a livery/car service and each driver/car has to be insured and licensed as per the city's rules. In markets with no taxi regulatory agency Uber can recruit regular drivers (usually the smaller the market the less rules set forth by the city) and have to worry about any extra insurance needed.


I'm actually working on a driver-owned platform and have my eye on how ethereum could play its part. I believe the individual ""nodes"" (drivers and their respective cars) should not be taken 30-50% commission from a software interface (which is ALL Uber is.) 


In NYC there are 100,000 ""TLC"" cars (commercially plated and insured for car service) all independently owned. The low-average cost of each car is $15,000. Also insurance for this type of car can run between $4-5000/year. That means the drivers paid $1.5 billion in equity and another $500 million/year on insurance premiums for Uber to even be able to operate in that market. It makes no sense that a 'million dollar app' can wedge itself into a bloated position. All these apps are is Google Maps (free) glued with a payment processing function.

5213,"What you're missing is that these services rely on a massive, world-wide collective of people working together to provide rides and any competitor wouldn't have that community in place. Designing a technically decentralized platform would be the easy part.

Uber would be particularly hard to copy because the community around it is geographically distributed so even if you attract random drivers / travellers, if they're not in roughly the same locations their contracts can't be matched. That means logically it has to start out in one place and organically spread to other locations. In the mean time, people in other locations will learn about the service and go to use it but there will be no one there, leaving a bad impression (hmm, lets use this in a contract?)

It's interesting to imagine what a solution to this problem might look like as incentive structure. Something to look to for inspiration might be multi-level marketing. You could imagine people going door-to-door to make sales, and earning a commission on top of anyone else they convince to do it. Imagine that spreading like a virus across a country, only its payload is to convince drivers to sign-up for your app.

If this were designed as a payment protocol (with rules in place to prevent too much competition and overlap so people actually earn money),  it may be possible to solve the difficult chicken-and-egg problem with community building. All of this could be engineered into an initial coin offering to fund a corporation that would automatically pay workers for signing up drivers. The fact that modern cars have so many sensors and the driver + customer would have smart phones on them would also automate auditing / oracles.

Then have everything feeding back into this smart contract corporation:

1. Cars generate revenue from customers which attracts investors
2. Investors buy shares in the corporation to receive dividends
3. These additional funds allow the corporation to hire / fire affiliate workers
4. How to keep this process growing? Is there a better model?  Some magic formula where you spend X automatically to acquire customer that generates more than X for the company with magic token money.
5. Insert other hacks to increase incentive value and mitigate panic + loss of interest.

Basically, just have multiple avenues for explosive growth. Maybe look into what causes multi-level marketing networks to grow or decay and work that into simulations. All part of the smart contract of course. Even use infectious disease simulations to troll /r/ethereum idk. If you're able to balance different people's interests and successfully exploit psychology to keep the momentum going I can't see why this wouldn't work in theory. Not saying it would be easy though.

I came across it a couple weeks ago, and it does seem potentially useful, both for smart contracts and other code, including clients.

And not just for correctness. Lamport talks about some software for a NASA spacecraft that was rewritten using TLA+ in the design process. The original code had been written to be compact, but with TLA+ they ended up with such a cleaner design that the new code was ten times smaller.

You'd need to use events, and you would then get the event (and it's parameters, e.g. `address child`) as part of the transaction data once mined. In practice this is a pretty flexible approach as you can ""return"" data from anywhere in the transaction, and provide context with the event name (and emit multiple events) although there is a gas cost to emitting events (relatively small).

As to why this is, I would guess it is because the return value would need to be a part of the consensus data which carries a cost, so having two separate mechanisms (return data for constant / view functions, or calling a non-constant function off-chain (i.e. call not send) vs. events for data that is included in consensus) makes sense to give developers fine grained control.

5628,"I will try to give you few ideas I think about too, and are bothering me:

1. I think the space misses people like you, who got tired of waiting, tired of reading, tired of writing, tired of expressing their ideas and ideals, tired of missed deadlines, tired of trading (saw trading volumes are super low), tired of changing roadmaps, etc.
2. **You guys need to come from the shadows and start expressing yourself again**
3. I sincerely don't understand why community funding is needed, as long as we have ETH Foundation in charge of grants. And, even if there is no official report on it (or audited like a company...I know ETH is not a company) I understand from the latest ETH 2.0 AMA they have a lot of funding still.
4. I am not sure yet how they decide to allocate those funds. I remember one dev in charge of EVM being pissed because his grant was cut, while eWASM is still far away (I might be wrong). On the same time they give some ETC to ETC development...
5. The fact that Vitalik needs to give from his personal ETH some ""grants"" to those teams you mentioned is fxxx up completely. Why we have ETH Foundation than? What is their focus? Isn't their focus aligned with ETH 2.0 development? Can you imagine you are counting the development of a multi billion dollars network infrastructure that rely on a few teams working after work?
6. How and why [ETH Foundation gives 5 mil grant to Parity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/01/07/announcing-an-ethereum-foundation-grant-to-parity-technologies/) (no offense to them, they really helped ETH, but lately I feel they also kind of lay down and cut some developments, like Parity UI, Windows support \~ I did point out to them these aspects) and why not to other ETH 2.0 teams?
7. Unless you work on ETH as a full time job, it's impossible to keep up with the news, developments, ETH 1.x, ETH 2.0, etc, which is why a lot of people got sick of it
8. I feel lately the space is full of people who don't give a fxxx about anything, all is TL;DR for them, while ETH is a complicated tech, which you need to comprehend
9. **Everybody expects somebody to do something about what is wrong**, but old timers stay hidden (and they are the ones to properly understand the tech probably), new comers are very vocal and oppose or criticize everything, based on false info they saw in different articles (probably...), which gives eth core devs false information about the community
10. From my own point of view, after being in ETH since 2016 also, and have no previous crypto experience, the ETH community is made up of the following: a. Traders b. Investors c. Miners d. Core Devs \~ in charge of layer 1 e. Other devs \~ in charge of layer 2, and/or in charge of different applications of actually using the network to build on
11. **These 5 groups seems totally disconnected from each-other in last 1 year, but probably they all represent the community you are mentioning**
12. These 5 groups used to be more homogeneous because each type was also involved in another type (Core devs also develop as other devs, also mining, traders mining, miners trading, investors investing in mining, etc.)
13. After the ecosystem evolved more and developed more, each one of these groups had to focus on one or maximum 2 things, otherwise I sincerely tell you it's impossible to keep track of. I am saying this as I have days when I try to keep track of all these groups somehow, and I find myself spending 8 hours a day doing it...And have to speed up my main job or come to work during the week-end because of that. And this while my financial exposure to ETH is not worth it frankly, but as you, I believe in this project, and I really liked the ""better BTC"" rhetoric.
14. Lately, I feel I spend too much time on it, I feel that ETH project is not aligned with what used to be at all, I feel in each one of the 5 groups I mentioned are a lot of people who profit of others back and/or have their own agenda against the initial plan, etc.
15. For me personally, I feel disappointing and also that is stupid to discuss if to kick-off ASICs in a project that was from the beginning launched as a reaction to BTC, while one of BTC's problems are ASICs and centralization
16. Some of the groups I mentioned, like for example traders and investors have no idea what ASIC's will do to ETH price, for example. They also have no clue to differentiate between pool centralization and miners centralization for example. They have no clue what nodes need to be upgraded to enable or disable a hard-fork and are critical infrastructure and what is not. Some have no clue that the hard forks we are implementing in ETH are not chain splits, so they keep asking where is their second coin. (on this I agree with Vitalik that we should change the name to upgrades)
17. Decentralization of management and/or software development seems not to work, or ETH has not yet find the proper way to do it.
18. Related to 17, let me show you an example: a. On one side Afri from Parity said this: [“If we don’t stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed.”](https://www.coindesk.com/the-race-is-on-to-replace-ethereums-most-centralized-layer) b. I pointed out to Afri a few problems already, some [mentioned here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aeo44g/know_anyone_who_runs_a_node_tell_them_to_update/edsdrm0), some directly to him, cannot find it now, but I will summarize: Parity UI was a good tool to use while running a full node, which gives you info about the node status, wallets, etc. Parity has discontinued that because they want to focus on something else, which is cool, some others should develop interfaces to connect to it, just that...they didn't yet. Another issue is discontinuing the support for windows users. Based on the fact that nobody at Parity is using windows. c. So by taking out parity UI and by taking out Windows support, you kind of make sure normal users like me and home users will not run full nodes. d. No full nodes means we will rely on other peoples nodes, including Infura. e. Basically it makes no sense, but it is just like I described.
19. Related to 17, what is the ""official"" channel of communication of ETH? Is it Reddit? Is it Twitter? Is ETH blog? What do you need to follow?
20. I am the guy who did [this against Fred Wilson](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/a7jjmh/fred_wilson_ripping_into_the_management_of/ec3nnka), but I also feel that ETH community, all those 5 groups, need to get their shxx together, or this project won't move further fast enough. The world is ready for blockchain, the whole world is watching this experiment, but if all we have to offer is 15 TPS in a decentralized network, the world will find something else, including another better project. If ETH 1.x doesn't evolve further and faster, until ETH 2.0 Phase 2 at least, a lot of people will probably lose interest on it. If ETH 1.x become centralized in the hands of a few who have ASICs, this will become a problem too.

This DAO could actually do much more for Ethereum development and progress, if it is set up properly. There needs better funding for devs, better coordination among various groups, and better understanding of what priorities might be best handled.

1) This only affects validators. Remember: As a user/current miner today/dapp user or developer, no one is ""paying more"" or giving to ""charity"". So yes, it's only to do with validators, and while it's still extremely early based on DM's and stuff it seems there are a lot of future validators who would welcome this change. If you are planning to validate in the future on a timeframe measured in years and don't feel this is a good proposal, I do encourage constructive feedback or a deconstruction on my post for why this is a bad thing. 

With that said, I want to challenge your thoughts on those two words. Here is why it's not a ""tax"" or ""charity"" and this is my actual mindset and why I am trying to push this forward:

As a future validator this is a protection of my underlying investment [ETH I am staking]. I am ensuring the network I am securing stays as competitive as possible in an increasingly competitive space, and thus my stake I am holding as a validator not only preserves its value but grows over time due to increasingly strong fundamentals. So when people say ""charity"" or ""tax"" to me you are missing the forest through the trees and overlooking this strong point.

Let's take this further: I'm not doing this for altruism and I'm not a hero for wanting to do this. I am doing this for my own selfish reasons -- which is preserving and growing the capital I have staked into our network. Lucky for me this also helps the network and its a win/win. There is nothing ""charitable"" about my reasoning at all -- in fact if I didn't even care about anyone but my own bottom line I would still want to do this. Please consider that framework before thinking of this as some selfless act -- it is actually self-serving in nature, but also just so happens to have positive butterfly effects throughout the ecosystem.",19-02-06-12-04,0,442,kazuya1987,anl49j,5648,0.0,0.23800000000000002,0.762,0.2924,100

I won't go into the nitty details here but my own analysis of it is they're not what we should ultimately rely on forever and it's a mistake to not think more long-term about this and align better incentives sooner rather than later. I suggest a DAO or 3rd party development fund, funded solely by % of tx fees from validators -- it is not opt in or out, but it is just there.  I genuinely believe rational/long-term validators would welcome this and understand why this is crucial for a sustainable but blossoming ecosystem. The details the community can come together on, but that is the idea at a high level.

5758,"According to others' and my own interpretation about the issue of articles 11-13, GDPR, etc. Ethereum is akin to internet infrastructure. Asking for an article 13 compliant blockchain would be similar to implement content filters at the internet protocol suite level something that's implausible to ask for. The same happens to GDPR directives, they are not meant to be forced into the internet protocol suite. So neither directive is going to be forced into blockchains directly.

However, applications and companies created in the EU and operating in the EU are subject to said regulations meaning that, if a company or a developer is the one deploying the dapp then they are the ones responsible to implement whatever content filter is required if article 13 were to pass as it currently is redacted. The same goes for GDPR directives, the company or developer is the one responsible for data protection and fines and all that GDPR entails.

It's still concerning, of course, specially some bureaucrats are suggesting that core developers should be also liable for these directives. A completely different issue, but still concerning nonetheless.

Now for what will happen with dapps, probably the same as regular webapps like youtube, a general geo-blocking in the EU for data storage, transfer, etc. and a block to all potential users located in the EU.

But I expect non-compliant websites and dapps still working in the EU; GDPR and the new copyright directive won't be able to block all content online that is not compliant with said directives, it's well established companies and startups who will suffer the most but sketchy websites offering mirrors of unblocked content will probably be found in the future, just like torrents of pirated content are still available right now.

You could theoretically speed up the propagation time by propagating directly to miners (mining pools) instead of through ~10 intermediaries, but this would be the difference of fractions of a second out of 14.5s-18s of time between blocks.

5848,">Zamfir v. Szabo on Governance & Law

It's not Zamfir v. just Szabo.

It's Zamfir versus the CypherPunk movement that gave rise to cryptocurrency. The principle of immutability that shields a blockchain from the interference of any third party is critical to the founding of both Bitcoin:

>>[Lengthy exposition of vulnerability of a systm to use-of-force\* >*monopolies ellided.\]*  
>>*You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.*  
>  
>Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.  Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.    Satoshi

And Ethereum:

[https://ethereum.org/](https://ethereum.org/)

>Build unstoppable applications  
>  
>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

Implying the scope of the constituency opposed to Zamfir's position is limited to Szabo is misleading.

>Here’s one way to read Vlad’s argument. There are basically three *categories* of “Laws” that structure and inform the crypto space: (1) the blockchain protocol; (2) law; (3) immutabilist ideology masquerading as principled law-and-econ and rights-based argumentation, but which is actually hollow politics-as-law (what Zamfir calls “Szabo’s law”).

This creates arbitrary categories of law, that just happens to put the idea of third party non-interference in the protocol's operation into a category of ""immutabilist ideology"" that, the author contends, is ""actually hollow politics-as-law"".

It's a false characterization of the author's Big Brother pro-centralization ideology as a formal and objective analysis of the facts.

>acknowledging that individual and institutional pulls *towards legality* are, pragmatically, the most secure blockchain development pathways available today.

That is not at all established. For one, it is impossible for any global network to be legal in any general sense, because it is multi-jurisdictional, and jurisdictions have many mutually incompatible laws, so even the premise is unsound.

Second, facilitating third party interference opens up a huge legal and security hole in the blockchain's stable operation. It promotes liability for whatever parties are given the task of acting as the human gatekeeper, and thus promotes the subordination of the decentralized blockchain under whichever jurisdiction the gatekeepers choose to subordinate themselves to.

Third, it creates opportunities for rent-seeking, that will bog the blockchain down in the social strife of legacy political systems.

Fourth, it promotes the prohibition of privacy on the blockchain - given privacy nullifies the effect of any social permissioning mechanism - which facilitates extreme centralization through warrantless mass-surveillance. Centralization is socially fragile and creates massive rent-seeking opportunities that reduce the efficiency of the system.

2. Even if it were possible to be subordinate to all states, the very subordination to a state means being controlled by a centralized state. Your mission of ""making blockchain legal"" everywhere would turn the blockchain into nothing more than a multinational corporation run by lawyers, to ensure legal compliance, with the trappings of cryptographic consensus on top.

The point I'm making is that cryptocurrency's original purpose was to protect these rights through technological means, including against government over-reach. What you're advocating would reduce the protection a blockchain offers to whatever is provided by the traditional legal system of some dominant jurisdiction, which would mean the blockchain would provide no benefit in protecting rights over existing systems, and no protection at all against government repression, since being legal implies being in compliance with repressive laws.

The very core of what we’re about & have been advocating publicly & privately is greater involvement in expert & non-expert stakeholder groups into the blockchain governance & law conversation.

On the topic of thesis, if the narrow question is legal control over protocol, that has been explained by Zamfir in a very clear and evidence-based manner in his OP.  And, again, that’s not a “core” thesis nor a “core” assumption of the crypto law argument that Zamfir is making. 

The core argument *seems* to be that continued we-are-ungovernable & super-duper-alegal postures have shown themselves to actually be transparent & unstable anti-legal arguments.  There are better ways of thinking about alegality & legality—without painting regulatory targets on our backs. 

Any attempt to distort the argument to ascribe some “Zamfir governance” vision or “agenda” or “program” are contrary to literally everything he’s written on governance &, now, on law. 

It’s not there, which is why you are grasping for straws to build straw-man arguments. But, really, a much better use of everyone’s energy seems to be continuing to audit the crypto legal conceptual chains to make sure that there are no serious mistakes. And once these mistakes start being documented, swift corrective action is necessary. 

It’s not more complicated than that. No jargon. No monkey business. 

The jargon is key to understanding the “how” and the “why” — but the political message (lower case “p”) is simple: crypto can keep doing the same thing it’s doing, and that’s getting pawned by lawyer-financiers; or crypto crews can invest more in the common-sense & pragmatic position that general-purpose global public blockchains need legal frameworks that allow blockchain stakeholders to do a *maximum* range of general-purpose global public things in the future. 

Optimizing for maximum freedom of action = optimizing for blockchain hyperutility apps = optimizing for scaling = optimizing for maximum opportunity for future economic participants. 

Optimizing for immutability = optimizing for crypto-finance & crypto-monetization = optimizing for maximum wealth & privilege for current crew of crypto whales. 

This is *one of* the socio-economic layers in the crypto law debate. There are many others. More analysis is needed, and welcomed.

This jargon is impenetrable.

I get that it gives you intellectual authority with those who don't have the time to read all of the other articles you've written to understand your references, but it's not conducive to involving as many people as possible in the discussion.

>The very core of what we’re about & have been advocating publicly & privately is greater involvement in expert & non-expert stakeholder groups into the blockchain governance & law conversation.

No, the core of what you're arguing is that the blockchain should strive to be legal everywhere. That's the point of divergence between your view and the cypherpunk movement's. How best to do that? Have it run by lawyers, like a traditional multinational corporation, and obviously make it jurisdictionally biased, to avoid trying to satisfy jurisdictions with laws that are incompatible with those of the dominant jurisdictions.

When you claim that the implication of your proposal to keep blockchain legal is not ""*not* subjugation to a lawyer class"", you're suggesting that law experts are not the best people to help a blockchain maintain compliance with the law,  which doesn't make sense.

In any other enterprise, lawyers are needed to maintain legal compliance. Yet now you're denying that this is what would be needed for the blockchain to do the same.

>It also is a low-cost & potentially high-yield legality maximization strategy, in that the greater the buy-in from prospective users & stakeholders

It would turn the blockchain into a traditional multinational legal entity, with all of the centralization and inefficiency that that entails. That's the only way to pursue a ""legality maximization strategy"". This would lead to fewer competitive advantages for blockchain over existing institutions, and less buy-in.

Also, your proposed strategy ""*would mean the blockchain would provide no benefit in protecting rights over existing systems, and no protection at all against government repression, since being legal implies being in compliance with repressive laws.""*

>it’s basic risk mitigation in a dynamic multi-actor environment.

Your proposed ""risk mitigation in a dynamic multi-actor environment"" is to ensure the blockchain complies with all laws of all jurisdictions. It's right there: ""keep blockchain legal"". Which goes back to the points I made in the previous comment, which you have not addressed.

So you're avoiding debating the specifics. You're making a point, and then when challenged on the implication of it, moving onto a different point you made, and avoiding addressing those implications.

Again with this false characterization of your thesis as an inevitability. Given it's not established as an inevitability, it is misleading to call this hypothetical legislation ""pending"".

You need to stop doing this. It's not the right way to interact with others. You can't just abandon truth in the pursuit of some supposedly higher purpose. The process, in the way you conduct yourself, is more important that the ends you are seeking to achieve.

There is no legal control exerted by any state over the protocol. You claimed there is, but there isn't. Now you're just moving the goalposts, and it's disingenuous.

>There are better ways of thinking about alegality & legality—without painting regulatory targets on our backs.

Another vague proposal that obscures what you're really advocating: social permissioning of the blockchain to ensure that the blockchain is legally compliant like a multinational corporation.
