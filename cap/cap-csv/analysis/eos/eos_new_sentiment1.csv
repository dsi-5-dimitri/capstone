Hosting and serving history for an account should be paid by that account. Accounts that want to keep history should ""setcode"" some standard structure that retains and manages history.

And the capacity of ""RAM"" (persisted database) should be upgraded in some way. Shards, SSDs, split the concept in two (""actual-RAM DB"" vs ""slower DB"" -- charge transactions accordingly) etc.

Event logging should be seen as e-mail. An account gets an ""email"" from the code, and the account can manage it.

If you want to keep a few audit nodes in the network to retain the full chain history, they will be more like archive.org for the blockchain. They don't have to serve full history in real time, and they can even demand payment (in EOS) to dig and serve arbitrary history logs (maybe users interested can pay a $5 subscription to retrieve up to 1 GB of logs per month, etc.)

This reasoning applies both to the event trace thing that's generated for accounts and for the block history itself. The network should snapshot itself regularly and synchronize from periodic snapshots, not replay everything from Day 1 every time. I'm not sure if it's already working like that, but it should. Blocks after a socially verified checkpoint event can be deleted from the live BPs; let EOS archive.org keep ancient block history.

253,"You could do that... I but as someone who likes simple, safe solutions, I did the following.

You already have a nano with a safe new owner/active key. The easiest way to enable usage of it, without having to change your genesis account and risk messing it up (until you are comfortable) is to just change the active key on the nano account. 

All you need to do is log into scatter Desktop, generate a new keypair, and save it wherever you save your PKs. 

By generating it with scatter it should show up as an unlinked account within that interface. Then just inspect (click on) your nano account with scatter and click on the 'change permissions' button, put in you scatter password, and change the ACTIVE KEY to your newly generated key. 

&#x200B;

This way you don't put your new nano owner keys at risk (by changing them yourself unnecessarily) and you avoid changing your genesis and nano account in a tandem/dependent way. If you are not sure, always just try this process on a dummy account using your nano. 

This leaves the originally all 'nano' account with your owner key on nano and your active key in scatter (and your password manager - don't forget), so no more nano confirmations unless you log in as @owner. 

You would still may want to change keys on your genesis account to make it safer, but just start simple and move your coins to a safe wallet in the meantime.

&#x200B;

Note: The Telos updateauth phishing scam could be thwarted (within the 3 day unstaking period) if you have a setup like this with owner key on hardware device and daily use keys in scatter. If your active key in compromised, you can just sign in using  @owner and change the active keys.",19-02-22-06-10,3,1,eoscience,at72ct,253,1.0,0.0,0.0,-0.4404,7

2. Does that mean then I can now use the private key from the newly generated and import that into my mobile wallet (EG: [MEET.ONE](https://MEET.ONE) wallet) and it will reference the nano wallet when i use it?

256,"Np. On a daily basis you would log in with active, the one that used to say '0 linked accounts', but now says '1 linked accounts', because you linked by going into the nano  'x linked accounts' key entry and changing the permissions as above.

Let's assume your nano is currently linked to an imaginary EOS account called 'nanoaccount1'. If you have linked the active and owner keys (even though its in the nano) with scatter, there will be a key entry for each one in scatter (on the left where you can search for your keys). This will allow you to log into any app either as the @active or @owner, usually you specify this when the popup comes up to pick the account you want to log in with, and near the top right click ""show all"". this will allow you to choose between the @active and @owner keys for  'nanoaccount1' when you log in. 

You can do log in and anything you'd expect with this @active key. And while you can log into apps using scatter with the @owner key on that account, if you try to send transactions with it, it will fail on the last step, cause it expects your nano to be plugged in.

Try it with a test account. Once you separate the keys (and have a test amount of eos), log in as @owner and try to send some or vote or something and you'll see you'll need your nano.

258,"After doing some testing last night I was able to get it all to work and I did replicate what you said about the nano requiring a password on @owner transactions. Everything seems good. But now I have another question.

Can you explain the purpose of why separating the owner/active keys into separate accounts is a security enhancement? It seems that if someone steals the private key of this newly generated account. They still have access to my nano account to do transactions which is essentially what I am doing. So I don't see how this is a security enhancement really. I do understand that the owner account has more priviledges than the active account but I don't know what things they are also. Can you provide some insight on this",19-02-22-06-10,2,1,killerjoe1990,at72ct,258,0.391,0.14,0.46799999999999997,-0.7531,7
259,"Sure, the basic idea is that you can have as many keys as you want, each for different purposes. Think if it like keys to a house. The @owner key is the master key, it can  let you in any door and change all the other keys. @active can let you in all the doors, but can't change the @owner. As a security measure, this means that if you have a bunch of coins staked in your nano account, and you fall victim to something like the Telos claim scam (please don't fall for this scam - look it up if not familiar) using your new @active key on your phone, the scammer will perform an 'updathauth' and change your @active keys you used to sign the transaction with, but will not be able to change @owner. They will then unstake your coins. If you set up email or telegram alerts with eosauthority (recommended) you will get an alert that this has happened with your @active keys, and you can just log in with @owner and change the @active keys. if you miss the 3 day unstaking period, the scammer absolutely can just send your newly unstaked eos to themselves. Setting up alerts is very important ATM.

One other note, you can also create arbitrary key permissions like @games or @newdex (this is bit advanced, bit just as doable), that only lets you use a key on a given app or set of apps, just like making a key for only one (or a few) door of your house. This way you don't have to worry about using your @active, which if compromised, can be used to unstake your coins. You could be even safer and use a permissioned key on your phone that does not allow stake/unstake for example. These advanced features will probably be easier for users to set in the near future.

637,"Shorters are too greedy in EOS. EOS dropped 30% in the last 24h and too many traders are still thinking it's an easy trade to short EOS. But they forget to watch EOSUSD SHORTS chart. This chart says that EOS shorts are still builing up, but shorters are not able to push the price lower anymore. That's the same situation that happened to BTC on 12th april 2018. When shorts are accumulating at the same price level, if bulls manage to push the price higher in a green pump, shorters will start to close their positions. And when there are many short positions on the same price level, this results in a massive ""short squeeze"".

Of course don't forget that shorts building up and price not moving down is not a guaranteed indicator that price will go up. Bears can still win and push the price down in the end and close their positions normally. But.. if bulls manage to make a push, it's a very bad situation for the bears, as all of the will start closing their shorts together (= buying).

BTC shorts are also on a rise, with BTC daily RSI touching oversold level, history shows that we always had a rally after that. This is a good time for long EOS position imho .

707,"I'm Scandinavian. We have the ""sweet-spot"" between capitalist and communist influence in some ways. Now, I absolutely abhor certain things about each system and I like to use a game design analogy when explaining my view, which some find extremely radical. This is because I want an entirely new system... surely, one that inherits from all of these.

&#x200B;

A very simplified explanation:

&#x200B;

In America, right next to the White House, you have a bunch of homeless people. Rampant social crises is a mild way of putting it. A person can be sufficiently unlucky, lose his or her job and perhaps this person also doesn't have a sufficient social safety net / money in the bank combination. This means you now live on the street.

&#x200B;

See, I said it was simplified.

&#x200B;

Homeless people in Scandinavian countries do exist, but in many ways they ""shouldn't"" seeing as they can get both free housing and security benefits from the government... even free psychiatric help. Most of the ""homeless"" people in Scandinavia are actually just gypsy scammers and you should not give them anything. The real homeless people (of which I actually grew up with such a person) have a severe mix of alcoholism / drug abuse and underlying psychological disorders. They can can help, but they simply refuse to or cannot mentally handle even the current welfare system... I am still trying to grasp this situation in it's minutiae.  


So, I am not denying that there are problems in Scandinavia as well, but I am saying that the current government sponsored benefit system in Sweden, Norway, Denmark etc. seem to better safeguard against certain societal problems. In America, the homeless problem is humongous in comparison.

&#x200B;

Now... my stupid, perhaps na√Øve game design analogy. Imagine you are playing a game and it is extremely difficult... bordering on insanity. You become frustrated and you throw it away. Now you put on another game. This game is offering you absolutely resistance and therefore no gratification... it is tedious. You also do not enjoy playing this game.   


The game of life, systemically speaking, should be structured to the individuals performance. You need a certain amount competition / challenge, but the level needs to be within range of your capabilities. Every once in awhile, you need some guidance / helpers / a weapon drop like you'd receive from the sky in Worms (old, but decent game).

I simply take the *competitive element* from capitalism / free market thinking and the *safety net* from communism and I see these two as variables. In my opinion, America could adjust it's safety net variable slightly. That's just my opinion.",19-02-19-08-27,3,636,pseudonympholepsy,as2b0l,707,0.039,0.10300000000000001,0.858,0.8694,22

709,"This is an awesome proposition; brilliant idea. I‚Äôm American (of Danish descent, among others, but I definitely have an affinity for Scandinavian design and thinking), and I think your assessment of society and homelessness is accurate. Further, your proposition that people should face society at the difficulty level they can handle (basically gamifying parts of their lives to make it challenging, rewarding, and actually livable...) is a truly fantastic idea, if it‚Äôs done correctly. 

My questions for you come back to your original comments around socialism and the existence of altruism in capitalism. I‚Äôm a citizen of the most capitalist country in the world, and from my view capitalist altruism cannot provide enough resources to make this type of vision a reality. There has to be a regulatory body linked to a different tax structure. There would be capitalist forces involved, but the network itself could not rely on ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù as it currently exists, both ideologically and in practice. 

Are you very familiar with Rudolph Steiner‚Äôs *Threefold Social Order* ? In case you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs basically a vision that addresses society in *economic,* *legal* and *cultural* terms, uniting to make one holistic system. Each domain needs to be carefully and consciously tended to, and safeguarded against controlling influence from the other two. This means that issues of economics need to stay within the real of the economy to a great extent, and that things like healthcare and education (that belong in the *cultural* sphere) should not be commodified or controlled by money. Et cetera for each sphere. 

The underlying idea is that each sphere has a unique presence and value that can be cultivated to its greatest degree, without the major influence of the other spheres. In my view this is a viable model that could be the underlying basis of your gaming model. And actually they would fit really well together. 

So my further question for you is: how can we create any sort of a just and equitable system without the healthy co-involvement of all three of these spheres? And if we do have govt involved in the regulation of this, wouldn‚Äôt that constitute socialism? Lastly, what is your personal reasoning around why you think large scale altruism can exist within a capitalist paradigm? (Or, how can the capitalist paradigm be utilized to help enable this new system you‚Äôre envisioning?) ",19-02-19-08-27,3,23,Cosmohumanist,as2b0l,709,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22

711,"I haven't read anything by Rudolph Steiner, but I know of him and I've added to book to my to-read list. Whilst it's obvious that there is in fact an economic dimension to things we would firstly deem legalistic or cultural, and vice versa a cultural perspective on the formation of law... etc. If I understand you correctly, Steiner is going by a sort of logic that certain things need to be as decoupled from money as possible, as to not interfere with their ""inherent nature"" to avoid impeding their process and hindering their optimal output. This is within proximity of my own reasoning. That might have been what you've picked up on. I generally think it horrible that, should you get hit by a car in certain parts of Asia, the first thing they do is stabilize you... then check your wallet for a passport or any given sign on you that you can afford treatment, only to pull the plug on a life that could've been saved simply because you didn't look wealthy.

This might be a moral issue. I see certain things as priceless -> life.

&#x200B;

Another example is politics. There's millions if not billions directed at swaying popular consensus... there's humongous sums of money being used on lobbying politicians... this is a direct case of *economics* and politically defined *legality* of what *cultural* expression may or may not take hold in society. Which in turn is perfectly exemplified by the current ""Is weed to be legal or not"" debate raging over pretty much the entire world.

My rapid going from subject to subject is likely due my slight inebriation. Wine!

>how can we create any sort of a just and equitable system without the healthy co-involvement of all three of these spheres?

I doubt we can do so without the inclusion of all of them... we need them and even more facets / labels of life. These are dimensions of human life and what it means to gather in what we call a society. But, we need to take into close consideration a variable such as *transparency*. Without transparency, economics and politics crossfire the entire country into an oligarchy. Without transparency in politics... all you have is a regime... how do you know that the held election was actually just?

&#x200B;

Freedom principles to navigate by: Transparency. Another one is *Access*... access to healthcare? To education? Perhaps you can help me with coming up with further principles, variables or ""knobs"" that need to be closely adjusted in a society.

&#x200B;

Altruism is a fascination of mine... really, just the idea of what motivates people. Some say that pure altruism doesn't exist... I actually don't care. I care about us structuring our society in such a way, that it systemically creates incentive for good behaviour and not bad behaviour. If crime pays... if crime and greed is rewarded more than kindness... then you breed crime and greed as a mindset. Theory of Evolution takes over from here... if the game requires cut-throat behaviour to win... then those are the genes that get forwarded. I do not want to live in a world of greed.

933,"Hi. Cool! You have this google document with Airdrops BUT, there arent really that many airdrops, and I think the doc was abandoned in October as the airdrop model turned out to be a bit flawed..it was basically too expensive for the projects to buy enough resources to do the airdrops. Most tokens get listed on newdex and dexeos almost before they exist., and newdex also provide some basic information on each token. You can also check out dappradar for some more info on many projects. These are decentralised exchanges and tokens are traded there at own risk. It's not that the exchange is unsafe or anything - as long as you log in with Scatter you are safe. But they list all kinds of tokens, some even I would say semi-scams or projects that are abandoned almost even before they are started. So do your due diligence on these. Other than that, it is very fun to get in on new projects at super super low prices. Remember - low liquidity, so I would not suggest trading. Buy some tokens and cross your fingers that they will succeed in the future.  Newdex and Dexeos all ready has hundreds of tokens trading. So have fun and be careful!

1036,"So, B1 scrambled to release ""on-time"" a minimum-viable blockchain last June with unfinished governance and hamstrung single-threaded performance, software that nearly 9 months later still lacks a multi-threaded core with IBC for side-chains.

In contrast, the opposite approach is now in vogue at B1.  Not a single release of a minimum-viable wallet, social media, exchange or governance software.  Almost 9 months have transpired without a single major release, just core patches-- not even REX.  Suddenly, dates aren't important, scope can creep, and software must be ""polished"" before it's released.

Can you appreciate the irony?

Who is clamoring for all of these""parallel"" projects from B1?  It's mostly self-inflicted scope.  Instead of a myriad of hamstrung sister chains, the ecosystem needs EOS itself to be a fully threaded base protocol that scales much higher with side chains.  That should have been-- and should be-- the primary task at hand today, not a bunch of ""parallel"" projects to build ""revolutionary"" applications.

That book describes everything I am talking about and my original post describes the gist of the mathematical conclusion. 

But if you would like to know more:

Consider the transition point of water molecules from gas to liquid to ice. We know that arrogate average kinetic energy within the mass increases as temperature rises. In other words the amount of kinetic movement per molecule is increasing and the molecular attraction of the molecules becomes less relevant for holding the  solid, liquid, or gas depending on the amount of kinetic energy on average between the molecules. At a given energy level within the group of molecules at any given moment there is a probability that a water molecule will connect with another given as (p)

A water molecules probability to connect to another water molecule is at p

Now consider a field of molecules bouncing around and the probability that any two molecules are connected is .5

(p = .5) This means that if you pick a water molecule pair half of the time you will actually be dealing with two connected water molecules. Ok so at this hypothetical temperature that produces p = .5 we cannot really think of the water molecules as individuals but as a bunch of individuals mixed in with a bunch of slightly larger groups of 2 and with even so a ( 25% chance) of picking up a group of 3 connected molecules. Do you follow? 

The math keeps on building from here showing the phase change temperature and how the math aligns perfectly ect ect.  all the way up networks of cells and diffusion ect. 

So even getting to this point of explanation causes me to have to write more than I care too. If you are not lazy you will check out that book and learn more about the math related to complex systems.

I think what you're effectively saying is that consensus becomes more difficult the more nodes exist in a network, i.e. the more decentralized something is. There's an equilibrium point at which more decentralization won't give you much more security/trustlessness/censorship resistance, but will degrade performance. If that is what you are trying to say, then I agree with your thesis. 

However, that ideal point of centralization/decentralization is unclear, and will continue to be unclear until enough time has passed that all of these experimental chains are thoroughly tested under adversarial conditions in the real world. I would say EOS thus far has failed that test and would be happy to go into reasons why.

EOS is not decentralized enough because only 15 BPs need to collude to control the entire platform. In fact, there are only 5 (!) full storage BPs nodes that are keeping the history of the chain. Due to EOS' speed, 4 TB is currently required to preserve this information, a number which is rapidly increasing with increasing number of transactions. This will in turn demand more hardware and financial resources from full storage BPs which will result in even more BP consolidation and more centralization.

 In general, DPoS is inherently flawed because BPs need to be voted in via staked coins. This facilitates vote buying, it also means that EOS/Tron hodlers are vulnerable to vigilance fatigue and/or not privy to secretive collusion, or they just won't care enough to vote cartels out. These aren't just theoretical attacks, they have played themselves out both with EOS, Tron, and Lisk multiple times (all DPoS platforms). Once chains start connecting with one another via projects like AION/Polkadot/Ark, different chains will be used for different purposes, but the most of amount of value will settle and accrue on the most secure chains.

1. All of the success of a platform comes from human effort. (agree Y/N?)
2. If you accept (1.) as true then all of platform success comes around how it treats humans in game theory depending on how we arrive a Nash Equilibrium result for human efforts (agree Y/N?)

&#x200B;

If we agree 1. and 2. then we take a look at Lisk and EOS. Lisk had over 100 validators and payment to those validators was 500% more in terms of network costs than EOS. This means that if you vote for the top 100 validators on LISK and they all vote buy then you get 5% return on your vote at a cost of the network having no investment back into itself. 

In EOS you have 21 validators who are paid 1% so vote buying is 80% less productive. 

Both are weak on this I absolutely agree. >>THIS IS A MAJOR WEAKNESS<<

With this in mind its important to make a distinction between collusion and ""working together"". 

Mutual cooperation is a good thing, but when it starts to form exclusivity then it is a bad thing. 

&#x200B;

What makes me confident in EOS is not that it will be success long run but that a derivative of DpOS will be the most successful commercial blockchain. This means money will flow through EOS to this derivative do to compatibility out the gate and long term success of it's Nash equilibrium. 

I see EOS as being like Netscape. Once a few more upgrades are added to compensate for the risk of collusion we will be at a fully commercial grade blockchain. 

One solution that I would propose is that block producers are forced to lock up a percentage of their income as a means of forcing them to have a stronger stake in the system success. 

&#x200B;

Now consider chains that are not DpOS. These chains form things like master nodes which vote for the final version of the chain as well. The reason I see these as being weaker (along with PoW) is that the inflation generated is at a complete waste. Some would say it is to secure the network. Well I don't see a network succeeding if its annual inflation is 3-5% sunk costs to secure the network. These sunk costs completely leave the network adding no additional services or new upgrades. 

We are not in the final stretch, but in my opinion EOS is the closest thing to that. It is very close. I also think it might actually put in place such improvements to it's governance to actually be the long term victor. Only time will tell.

1335,"Market cap can be an abstract way to measure value of a cryptocurrency network. If many financial products and services migrate to a blockchain then that network would be responsible for trillions of value in tokenized assets. Imagine a whole state, or even a country begins to manage it's land ownership on a blockchain, or an entire industry's supply chain becomes tokenized and tracked more securely. The underlying value of the network this all happens on is going to grow exponentially to heights we haven't even imagined. Even a US congressman was quoted in some hearings last year that he believes the crypto currency market could grow to 20 trillion dollars. This is the future of all of money and things will eventually migrate to a more transparent and frictionless system, if one network becomes 1/6th of overall market cap then that is around 3 trillion dollars. This is not to say EOS is worth 3 trillion right now, but it sure has a good leg up against the competition and a 3 trillion marketcap for one crypto seems somewhat reasonable assuming worldwide adoption at some point.",19-02-15-05-45,2,186,stablecoin,aqn27b,1335,0.209,0.21600000000000003,0.5760000000000001,0.0258,33

So maybe you can find an answer here. 

All your keys , are already in nano ledger. and you just pull new keys as you need them (unlimited).  (so two key pairs active and owner  per account)  So 8 keys from ledger. 


Technically speaking  there is no private key Only a public for nano. 


Now I use scatter and in that I can import a key index.  So I could  have 0-7. For 8 key pairs of active and owner.  I then just import the keyed index number into scatter when needed.  (whcih altshift does)

If they use open source software, they don't owe jack to anyone. If anything, the only stretch you can make is that they owe B1 for writing the code (which they might have come to an arrangement with them). But even then... 

Take other examples of open source projects and you'll see that the only reason people are even talking about compensation is that there is an incentive mechanism built into it with which one can compensate. But that doesn't imply an obligation to do so. Take Linux. Does Redhat owe the installed userbase or Linus Torvalds any compensation for taking the GNU/Linux kernel and the underlying distro on top of which they built RHEL?

Private companies can and should use open source software to make profits for themselves. That's because everyone should use open source software, if you ask me.

And as for the Worbli Foundation being non profit, it is still their imperative to promote their chain and make it as profitable as possible. All charities aim to be profitable, otherwise they wouldn't be able to help their cause. What makes them a not-for-profit organization is that the entity's owners do not take dividends. Rather they reinvest the profit they make back into the entity's operations.

I see nothing wrong with the Worbli Foundation (1) using EOSIO software without compensating anyone, and (2) doing so to increase their profits that they plow back into the chain.

Do they suck ass for going back on their word? Yes! But for every promise a good company makes I can find you a promise a good company breaks. It's part of doing business in an unpredictable world. ",19-02-12-08-55,5,143,besthingsinliferfree,aplkhz,1672,0.142,0.0,0.858,-0.7003,12

If you are so upbeat about your investment look at the spread of 25% value between ask and bid and tell me what you think. 

There are certain ways to value a non profit open foundation's tokens vs that of a private enterprise with its own divided interests. Some still have not got this point. As far as I am concerned, any sister chain or fork chain or robber chain/train, that does not equitably reward the original eos investors in same tokenomics as B1 used, 90% to 10% , is purely using other people's money to advance their own interests.

Evolution speed - how quickly can the code of the chain be improved to serve the needs of users. (Bitcoin/ethereum guilty).

Ease of use - can your grandmother use it (all chains guilty/especially EOS)

APP/DAPP value - can the blockchain seamlessly transact with games, apps.

Fungibility - how many individuals/merchants accept the cryptocurrency (all chains guilty)

Privacy - how close to 100% can you remove you identify from transactions on the blockchain. (Ripple you want go to bed with the banking sector)

Unfortunately any voting mechanism can be gamed easily. Imagine a network of accounts that nobody can ban since there is no authority to ban anyone. This network auto-upvote their own posts, defeating most (real) downvote pressure. If you do it the right way, if you are patient and wait until you gain enough accounts to have a huge influence, you can become the (viagra) king of any social network. It's not even hard. Not even captchas or fees (yuck! who would want that when you have free?!) can stop that.

1911,"Your ""Key Expectation Set"" states that the 15/21 BP quorum should *not* be able to decide to revert transactions that are bad for humans but that are neutral to the network.

That is 

(a) bad (just wait for a DAO-like / Parity-like situation...)

and

(b) is human language that is doing a cultural overruling of the already-present possibility of a 15/21 BP quorum doing *anything* to the chain, which is the present intended behavior of the existing deployed system.

It would be better if your EOA approached from the following angle instead:

- By default, <insert your key expectation set here>, because BPs want very strongly to not be liable and to not have to interfere. BPs really don't want to be acting on random mutation requests being pushed by an external entity that they think they are obliged to respond to

- BUT that can be overruled by a BP 15/21 quorum, which is the ultimate authority of the chain on all matters.

The point is that instead of acting as employees of an external ECAF entity that pushes work to you, the BP quorum should act as a sovereign entity with FINAL say on what the system state is, so should the quorum CHOOSE to enact an ECAF or ECAF-like entity, they are subordinate to the BP quorum and act like a helper, and not the other way around.

But by default, there is no ECAF. There is the BP quorum, and that's all there is. That is the actual truth of the code, if you really want a human truth (an user agreement) in human language to match what's in the code and is probably never going to change.

That ""no account recoveries"" statement in your proposed foundational document just makes it poorer. That alone makes the original interim ""constitution"" (blargh) actually better as a starting point.

That's also why there were projects that dropped you 100 tokens and if you sent those 100 tokens, you'd get 1,000 back. All these are ways for the users to pay for the cost of RAM. The airdrop transaction itself only diminishes your CPU, which you get back in 3 days. The ridiculous costs were because at the time RAM costs were spiking and so it's the RAM that made it prohibitively expensive. If users pay for RAM on simple airdrops, that wouldn't have even been an issue.

1976,"EOS is a little more complicated than Bitcoin or even Ethereum, it's best to read the beggining thread pinned at the top of this sub fully. I'll try to explain a little more on your specific questions below, but the more you read about it the more you will understand how this blockchain works.

>Question 1:

Staked means locked up by the EOS blockchain. In EOS every owner has a share of the blockchain resources, the amount of resources you have depends on how many tokens you staked. For example, staked tokens to CPU give you a percentage of all available CPU actions (transfers, contracts, dice rolls, etc). Most things right now take CPU so NET is not really needed to stake a lot. If you look at your account on a block explorer it will show you how much you have staked and how much of that percentage of blockchain resources are used up. Normal users should stake as many tokens as they need for blockchain actions. Unused tokens can also be staked for voting weight and also to protect your account from a hacker if they somehow managed to gain your ACTIVE key. You can unstake at anytime and it takes 3 days for the network to unstake them back into your liquid account.

>Question 2:

Same as above, the bars are the amount of resources you have available to blockchain actions. The more you stake the more actions you have available to you, so your bar will go down if you stake more into each category. To stake more or less you just need interface with your wallet via a tool like MEOW (altshiftdev.com) and connect your ledger. NOTE: RAM is not the same as CPU/NET, in that you are actually purchasing RAM using EOS tokens and RAM doesn't regenerate the same way CPU/NET do. If you have too much RAM you can sell the unused portion, or if you are holding a lot of different tokens you might need to purchase more RAM so your account continues to operate as normal.

>Question 3:

It is spam or even phishing attempts. Best to ignore any small tx at this time and collect the tokens as free money.

>Question 4:

They could be spam but a lot of the EOS dapps are not really big enough for Coinmarketcap to mention. If they get a bigger footprint they could be mentioned on there. A lot of dapps only have telegram set up and you'll need to research each one individually before deciding to keep it or sell.

>Question 5:

You can delegate your own tokens to some other account CPU/NET if you wanted. In the future this is more for a Dapp to be able to give access to their users for blockchain network actions without having to understand all this stuff. Also you can delegate tokens to create a new account. Delegate voting is also a thing though you are just delegating the weight of your tokens (not the actual control of tokens) to some other trusted party.

>Question 6: 

Best to vote for a proxy account such as ""investingwad"" or ""colintcrypto"" to allow them to vote for you if you don't want to take the time to research all the block producers yourself. You do not hand over control of your tokens only the amount of voting weight they carry. If you vote for a proxy account and you have 10 tokens staked, then either of those proxy voting accounts now has 10 more tokens to influence against their votes. Both of those accounts are run by serious EOS holders who spend a lot of time in the community and Youtube making sure that information is out there and people can make informed decisions.

2051,"I'm a little confused as to the specific problem but most times best have separate Owner and Active keys for each account. You didn't say either how you are generating the other keys so hopefully you are doing it from one of the proven safe wallets like greymass and disconnecting your device from the internet when generating. Also I'm assuming you know that each Owner & Active key also has a Public/Private key pair.

Active Key -> Change to Ledger generated public key. Everyday or normal use, never leaves device, only Ledger can access this Active permission. Private key is insulated from anything but the Ledger, not able to recover manually unless you recover a new Ledger from your same seed words. Pretty safe unless you somehow change a permission or send tokens out using a fraudulent contract. Active key cannot change Owner key.


Owner Key ->  Paper Wallet only, private key-pairing never touches electronic device unless you need to take back control of a hacked Active key or do some other advanced permission that a future update might allow. Owner key can change either Owner or Active key.


Even if you don't use a Ledger for all your accounts you would still want to have separate Owner/Active keys as a best practice. Nothing is foolproof, and having non-needed tokens staked away and only using Active keys for most functions insulates you with 3 extra days to take back control of the Active keys and thwart any attempt to steal tokens after they are unstaked. Hopefully this helps with more information. It looks like you staked somewhere too but I'm not clear if you staked to another account or just within the same one and where the issue with transferring tokens is coming from.",19-02-08-11-54,3,186,stablecoin,aoaybm,2051,0.24100000000000002,0.0,0.759,-0.2263,12

2056,"That's a good question and I should have been more specific. You can't roll a dice like with Bitcoin to be completely electronics free (as far as I'm aware), but you can boot up a fresh Linux install on an old device that doesn't ever (or will ever) connect to the internet afterwards. From that secluded device you can use command tools like cleos, or even a trusted graphical wallet interface like greymass or scatter. Write the keys down on paper and wiping or destroying the device afterwards is probably the safest and possibly even a little overkill, but you would be assured that the Owner private key never touch online. 

During the EOS ICO Block One had a key generation tool on their website as part of the process to register your ETH tokens and get your EOS main-net keys. During registration they made you disconnect from the internet as part of the key generation. As far as I'm aware this method proved safe for all genesis token holders unless you unwittingly used a non-B.1 phishing site to generate your keys. Some people have also installed fake wallets afterwards which stole their keys.

Main point is that if your keys are generated from a non-infected PC in an offline mode from trusted tools (cleos, greymass, scatter, etc), and then the Owner key is written on paper or stamped on metal, and remains offline always, then it is going to be pretty darn safe from online hack attempts. The amount of EOS you intend to hold will also determine the amount of precautions you take in key generation. For example my cell phone wallet is a separate account and I just generated keys from my regular PC (disconnected at the time) and printed them through my printer to store offline. Wouldn't recommend that for any significant amount though, my PC probably has something deep in it's memory and I'm sure my cheap printer stores some information too, but for less than the $100 I keep on the wallet I don't lose any sleep over it. The keys for the Block.One wallet with 100 million EOS tokens were probably generated by network security experts on a completely air-gapped computer inside a bunker that will never ever be online and possibly incinerated afterwards, along with said network security experts.",19-02-08-11-54,2,186,stablecoin,aoaybm,2056,0.21,0.259,0.531,0.0258,12
2057,"Ok thanks for clarifying a little. It sounds like maybe you didn't change the keys like you thought if you weren't able to sign into a wallet or send any tokens. Both Owner and Active will let you stake, unstake, send tokens, etc. They basically have equal permission other than ACTIVE key can't change OWNER key. If one isn't working you either didn't change it correctly or mis-typed the key in at some point. If your OWNER is locked out that could be a problem and I would just create a new account entirely, or if a Ledger wipe and restore from a new seed to get a new key pair. (NOTE: DO NOT WIPE IF YOU STILL HAVE TOKENS ON THE ACCOUNT, TRANSFER EVERYTHING TO AN OWNER YOU CONTROL BEFORE TRYING TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS) You can check your account on the block explorer (I like to use bloks.io) to see what keys are assigned to the account, under the permissions tab once you find your account name. (If you can't find keys assigned say account name and I will tell you the keys, you linked a speedtest above or something by mistake). The block explorer will show you which PUBLIC keys are assigned to the Owner and Active permissions. From there you can determine if the permissions were correctly changed to the public keys you thought you generated. It gets a little complicated once you use the Ledger but how I understand it Ledger only generates one key pair, and you can make it either Owner, Active, or change it to both as EOS lets you use same key-pair due to blockchain design (funnily enough all the genesis accounts had 1 matching key for both too).  

So if you changed Owner and Active to the same on the Ledger (EOSy), for myself I would change the Owner back to the old Owner key if you think it is still safe or generate some new key like you have been doing and save it securely on paper. This will only be for emergency purposes and it kind of gives you extra backup possibility if the ledger was irreparably lost or bugged out somehow. Again this is optional due to the design of EOS blockchain but I think in best practice as long as the OWNER was generated securely.

For your main account (EOSx), your non-used tokens should be staked and you should def have separate Owner/Active keys. It sounds like you are doing the right things by generating offline and keeping separate keys on this account. I wouldn't necessarily change the OWNER key from what was working already, but if you have had to input the OWNER key a few times to change ACTIVE and you aren't positive that the machine is 100% secure, it might be a good idea to get a fresh offline key. For this main account (EOSx) it's even more important than the ledger account I think to have separate key-pair. This is because the ledger by design is very secure in that even you couldn't access the private key from it, only the Ledger hardware can read it and your clicking signs transactions offline that are then pushed out online to the blockchain. So in your setup, your main account ACTIVE keys are going to actually be exposed when you use a wallet, not in an unsafe way but by design this is somewhat less secure than the ledger. You could have malware that copies screenshots, clipboard, etc., and even just inputting the key to the wallet the first time exposes a plain text version open to screen capture  etc.. It is not *insecure* this way it just opens you up to more exposure where especially if this is your main account it's best to have an OWNER key that was safely generated and never used before. For this main account, I personally would even use a separate PC that is dedicated to crytpo and very little to zero network action. Just due to the fact that it has most of my coins accessible and even inputting via the wallet *CAN* expose your ACTIVE key at least to the wallet software, and the wallet has to save the key in an encrypted file on your PC. Using a Ledger for most activity is more secure than using a network connected PC.

Sorry for the long explanation but am glad you are taking the precautions and the time to learn what all these things do. Also please note that I am suggesting very safe precautions from a paranoid person. In practice it might be overkill doing all these separate permissions, and generating things offline, not re-using OWNER keys if possible, but then again the amount of threads I have read where crypto was stolen by malware or other phishing attempts keeps me diligent in this process. The good part of EOS is you actually do have an avenue to fight back if you had tokens staked and only used separate ACTIVE key with day-to-day activities. In the future I think this will all be much easier as more and more hardware and custody options are developed, but in these early days it definitely takes a steep learning curve. Please keep me posted if something still doesn't make sense, but seems like you are getting a good handle on it and am happy if this helps.",19-02-08-11-54,2,186,stablecoin,aoaybm,2057,0.217,0.0,0.7829999999999999,-0.9034,12

If there be a thousand forks of eos and they all work like a shard, that would be the ideal scaling and decentralization for EOS imo..

And, if the stated reason is so that an investor can evaluate the opportunities and wants to see a stable supply first, then 1) that investor is to them more important than 60% of their potential token holders - so I'd say that doesn't speak well for their regard for potential customers, and 2) they have this somewhat naive notion that an end to a share drop somehow helps price settle... proven to be wrong many times before.  The investor could have just been satisfied that there will be a max X tokens in existence, and that at the moment a given number have already been claimed.  if they can't make a decision as an investor based on these facts maybe they are not that sophisticated and worth dealing with for Worbli.

Some of my core premises

* 1) Sharding / Partioning blockchains is not feasible https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07356
* 2) Even if it was feasible then you still suffer from value migration to faster and more efficient blockchains. Every second in latency costs hundreds of millions of dollars in global productivity (at scale)
* 3) In order to stay competitive, ETH has to reduce validator count, this defeats its original premise 
* 4) The original premise is not sound (you dont need to validate smart contracts across thousands of nodes, just as many to remove single point of failure, achieve meaningful decentralization and remove trust. I suggest you try to imagine how it would work on paper, quite literally and then when you write the ledgers down then you also wouldnt copy it 1000+ times, you would copy it 20-30 times and then select a few people to manage it)

2163,"1 EOSIO can increase validator / BP count infinitely at cost to latency (other blockchains cant and have to introduce caps to guarantee BFT)

2 No it is even fairer than ETH. ETH is a technocratic oligarchy controlled by white males in their 20s where stakeholders have no say. EOS is a fluid democracy where stakeholders are everything. 

3 What's further, I will bet that ETH due to inherent flaws in its core design will over time have fewer than 100 validators in order to stay competitive. The entire blockchain exceeds 1TB. At scale you cannot host this thing efficiently on consumer nodes. Sharding is also a lie:

**Read this https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07356 (and I mean actually read)**

Also, what you keep forgetting like everyone else. EOS scales horizontally, meaning thousands of blockchains each with their own governance. That is real decentralization not whatever Ethereum promotes these days as shitshow-Consensys-I-dont-understand-decentralization says it is. 

Last but not least, Ethereum relies fully on Layer2 (for scaling!!), meaning EOS has the upper hand because Ethereums layer2 is BS BS BS (repeat after me). While EOS does everything onchain due to efficient programming and a great design philosophy taken from Satoshi himself, ETH is struggling with insecure programming languages and offloads transactions offchain. This invites tampering and is not real scaling.

Sorry for being a bit excessive, but it is annoying to see the misinfo floating around. I give Ethereum a lot of credit. Especially Vitalik for his recent work on Plasma which actually is impressive but they need to turn things around before ETH becomes investable again

PS In my personal and professional opinion, Ethereum is a great platform if you want full decentralization but we are so early that I believe Ethereum will be disrupted by 1) EOS 2) Tezos 3) Polkadot. EOS and DOT both are wasm-native and dont rely on Solidity which I think will prove to create a bottleneck. I also dont think Ethereum can scale socially and Ethereum reminds me a bit of a hub (I call it hierarchical superzone, you can find out more here https://discord.gg/EudjGTU) rather than a protocol.

2258,"The hard manual way is to create a custom CSV.  That becomes hard because you may have had many buys into EOS ICO coins.  Then those launched onto EOS main net.  When you eventually sold some or traded for other tokens, then it is very painful to find which sells/trades matched which ICO buy-in.   It is hard to connect each EOS ICO ERC20 coin to each EOS main net holdings, that eventually sold or traded.  


The hard work that ZenLedger does makes it simple and trivial:  
\* I purchased many times into EOS ICO on Binance.  ZenLedger has you enter the API keys to Binance and it imports everything  
\* I had EOS on my Exodus Wallet.  I bought into the EOS ICO on Exodus wallet by trading ETH to EOS through Exodus wallet/shapeshift.  
\* The Exodus wallet EOS moved from ERC20 to EOS main net when it launched.  
\* I had to move EOS from Exodus wallet to a dedicated EOS wallet in order to unstake it.  Then I moved it to Binance to sell to ETH.  
\* ZenLedger makes all of this trivial.  Enter API keys for Binance, Coinbase.  Enter the wallet addresses from Exodus wallet and the EOS dedicated wallet.  That is it.  It just outputs your 8949 PDF tax forms.  
\* ZenLedger's special support reads directly from EOS main net.  It reads EOS ERC20 ICO coins from Ethereum's blockchain.  It links every tiny transaction.  It handles the large amount of computation.  


This is otherwise hard because every traded EOS to ETH eventually, that one ""taxable event"" may have needed to bring in 8 and half amounts of EOS you had.  It needs to calculate the cost basis of the value of each of those 8+ when you traded into the EOS ICO coin.

Yes, it's interesting data, but no, it's not that judgmental.   


Running a BP node is not simply running a server, it has a lot of aspects to it.   
For example: As a BP you can set the timing for your production so that you fork off the BP ahead of you.   
This means that if you as a BP come in, with a node that is not optimized to the timezone of the BP around you, that may lead to forks.   


This doesn't result in any real issues, because the blocks are being produced by A BP, but the data will show missed blocks since the BP infront do not reach 12 in a round. 

&#x200B;

Another aspect of the Missed blocks is that someone that is new, will have less missed blocks than someone that has been here from start. This is also a key aspect.

The only place where i can see any 'accounts' on scatter is on the ""Add Account"" or ""Linked Accounts"" tabs (that show up after I import public keys from the ledger or when i click on the on of the keys on the left side of the scatter desktop homepage). It allows me to ""link existing EOS account"" to the EOS mainnet, and it suggests ""your.account.owner"" . I don't know what I would put for ""\[YOURACCOUNTHERE\]@\[THE PERMISSION TYPE\]"", but i have tried just writing things like ""test"" or ""test1"" and it allows me to do this and then it shows up on the ""Linked Accounts"" page as a new ""linked account"" i think.

I'm guessing that I need to create the account in some other way?

2485,"I appreciate your response. What you propose is probably very effective. There is a Google Authentication App that does it. The passwords change every minute. They are specific to a registered cell phone. If you are on a crypto exchange, you have to key in the six digits quick enough to gain access, and you can add another layer involving a known and registered e-mail. So, an attacker would have to have you phone and its credentials, and they would also need to have access to your e-mail account. Also, you can do the thing with a password locker like KeyPassX, and then encrypt that with something like Cryptoforge. They'd have to hack Cryptoforge, then KeyPassX. Or, if they have hacked your machine, they could maybe get stuff from your clipboard? You can reduce this possibility with a script like C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c ‚Äúecho off | clip‚Äù

The thing with EOSIO being about to have two key pairs, one ""Active"" and one ""Owner"" is pretty slick!!!

The only problem is: Do you really trust Google and Eric Schmidt? The only thing I have found for EOS and ETH is the xcubicle app...

It must use Google Chrome: [https://github.com/xcubicle/memorypaperwallet](https://github.com/xcubicle/memorypaperwallet)

Also, you cannot just use a seed phrase, you are forced to ""salt"" the key generation by using an e-mail or a user name in a separate field.

I guess the point of this thread is to go against the grain. Brain wallets are considered risky, and a coin's perceived vulnerability affects its value!!! So, they don't want ignorant people (like me, hahahaha) doing risky things and then crying about getting robbed.

People actually want to be able to keep a huge sum of money in their head. If the key generation is done on an air-gapped machine, and the seed phrase is ridiculously LONG, then what's the big deal??? See, the seed phrase is really just a final safety. You'd still want to keep the keys in a password locker of some sorts, maybe even heavily encrypted on a cloud?

Anyway, projects like EOSIO and Ethereum shrugging off this is not helpful for an average user who is more concerned about misplacing a usb stick, or having a paper wallet burn in a fire, or get stolen from a safe, yada yada yada.

It is nice that nobody was able to collect the reward for the xcubicle app.

This is a pretty basic programming concept where we try to never create systems that rely on any specific architecture because we know how fast demands change.

There's something called a DAO (data access object, yes I get the irony there though) in programming which is a way to make calls to a database which doesn't assume any particular database underneath, and allows you to switch databases at will without affecting the rest of your code. It's a very popular principal because switching to other databases over time is fairly common based on the growing needs of a company. 

The same is true of blockchain projects and practically inevitable. At some point you're going to need something else. It might be tomorrow, or 2 years from now but it will happen. Based on the decisions you make today you will either have to recode your entire product or you will be able to just swap the underlying blockchain out with minimal effort. One of those options is likely to kill your product since recoding the entire thing will cause a huge gap in time where no new features can be added and only maintenance can be done, consuming 100% of your resources.

2521,"Q1: What is the current status of EOS? 

A: Live main net plus multiple sister chains that use the same code base plus some tweaks. 


Q2: Are there projects operating on it? 

A: Many. Currently mostly gambling, but a lot that are very very varied, from ride sharing apps to social media to art to blogging to encyclopedias. 


Q3: Does it scale--, to how many tps? 

A: Much better than 99% of blockchain projects out there. Half second block times, 4k TPS. 


Q4: What does that mean in terms of the kinds of applications that are running on it? 

A: See above for types of apps. Also see above the scaling answer plus the fact that it's free transactions means that pretty much any app will likely be successful on EOS. 


Q5: Are there any major issues? 

A:The cost to store data on the chain is currently hindering some projects, and the amount of transactions you can do depends on the amount of EOS you have staked. Both these issues are getting fixed with orders of magnitude improvements on a regular basis. Governance is also an issue that is being worked on. Considering it's on chain governance, the issue is more visible than would otherwise have been, but the strength of the system and community make this a minor obstacle to overcome, and it will. 


Q6: What are the big things on the roadmap? 

A: World domination! Muhaha! Just kidding, but seriously, the fact that it can accommodate apps that scale, the sky is the limit. Block One is a big force to contend with. They have a war chest and will spend it on apps and base layer improvements. But the community is equally important and much more creative. 


Q7: How does this all compare to ETH?

A: It leaves ETH in its dust. ETH is taking forever to deliver on its scaling solution. Apps built on ETH are way down the rankings of usage and scaling. That said, ETH has the benefit of hundreds of projects based on ERC-20 and thousands of developers. ETH isn't going anywhere and we all wish them luck on their endeavors. But with bridges already built to transfer tokens between ETH and EOS, it's a matter of time before many of the projects migrate over to EOS.

2701,"I'll start by saying I absolutely love u/eosnewyork, but I think with this one you are wrong. 

I think that a slowly changing blockchain is not a bad idea. It gives an element of stability and comfort to big projects who like the predictability that this engenders.

Referenda are not meant to pass quickly. It's not ""hey, what are we having for dinner tonight?"", it's pretty intense decisions with intense ramifications. Even 15% of token holders voting yes and none voting no, it's still a decision made based on only 15% of the population. Hardly a slam dunk, democratically speaking. Reducing it further just makes it worse. 

And yes, it could be that such a scenario would happen where 15 renegade BPs signal that they will implement it and they get in the top 21. If that happens, so be it. But I doubt it ever would. Shifting around the top 21 is hard enough as it is. Why circumvent the 15% turnout rule just because a theoretical attack vector is possible? It's like saying in not going to close my front door because someone theoretically could break in anyway. 

Another thing is that it's not just a question about voter turnout... 

Let's say that a referendum that has achieved >15% but is a close call on 10% yes/no delta, effectively resetting the clock on when the advantage goes into effect over and over again so they don't get the ""required period"" criterion met. Using the same logic in your 14% analogy, you could say that conceivably a BP will say the second it achieves +15% & > 10% yes / no, they will implement, effectively throwing out the time requirement. And why stop there? A BP could say that any referendum that has 90%+ yes votes with 5%+ voter turnout is enough to signal it's desirable. Etc... Voter turnout is not the only thing that hinders referenda passing.

If we make it easy to pass referenda, the noise-to-signal ratio will get worse, there will be a lot more judgement involved, things will be implemented that aren't really reflective of token holder desires, and we will come to rue the day we decided to simplify the process to change critical features of the chain.

IMHO apathy in crypto in general is because it lacks adoption. People are not used to use crypto to buy things and do stuff.

AFAIK EOS Sweden and us (Greymass) are the only ones running native history APIs, but there are other groups out there running non-native APIs, such as:

- CryptoLions running their MongoDB API plugin (open source) 
- EOS Tribe running their ElasticSearch API plugin (open source)
- EOS Canada running dfuse (closed source). 

These APIs aren't 100% compatible with the native history APIs, so they aren't a drop-in replacement for the native APIs, but they're contributing in their own way. 

Until a true replacement and standards around it are created, the EOS ecosystem really needs more of these native APIs, that adhere to the standard request/responses that applications expect from the blockchain's APIs.

Here's a link to a  thorough article that contains a number of useful links. There is a way to run Debian on most chromebooks that are fairly recent. Links point to lists of those chromebooks that will work, those that might work in the near future, and those that will never work. 

The software that smooths the way for Debian is called Crostini. 

My chromebook, Dell 11, four years old, is a never worker. When I bought it I used software called crouton to install a linux. It was an early hack and pretty shaky. My impression is that Crostini is reasonably solid, although problems (of course) pop up here and there in the cooking. Sorry not be of more help.

On a personal note, Pam and I save our pennies and go to Greece every year just to be away from the U.S. which has been slowly disintegrating ever since the lying and divisions and loss of the Vietnam years. Greek culture, as you probably know, is marvelously balanced, having seen everything in the last five thousand years. We wander around the islands, glad to be alive, making friends that we see again and again. I used to write books (never made a dime, nor cared, really). If you're interested, look me up on Amazon: John Moncure Wetterau. ""Every Story is a Love Story"" is a short novel set in Woodstock in the sixties, just before the festival. It is one of my favorite books, as close to how it was as I could get.  Now I'm learning to draw and paint, a nice change from years of linear writing and programming. If you start to burn out, I recommend ""Drawing On the Right Side of the Brain,"" Betty Edwards, a truly excellent book.

3021,"In EOS Smart contracts are written in C++ which is a system level programming language. On the other hand TRON uses solidity which is a scripting language used in ethereum.
C++ is harder to pickup but it‚Äôs much more powerful and allows developers deploy more complex code with smart contract logic, additionally EOS has a database accessible within the smart contract that allows developers to have tables indexes etc whereas in solidity they have only key value structures. 
Projects that are of high complexity and require low level functions like Cryptography and other projects that need a proper database like decentralized exchanges are better suited for EOS. 
TRON can grow rapidly because it uses solidity as its smart contract language with which a lot of dApp developers are familiar with, as they used it in Ethereum. They can also port their existing smart contracts with minor modifications and benefit from the lack of fees and lower latency. Moreover solidity is easier to pick up for the younger generation of developers. Another advantage of TRON is that developers don‚Äôt need to handle RAM that makes things more complex in EOS. 
The big weakness in my mind of both protocols is the requirement from developers and users to manage resources (cpu and network or whatever TRON calls them) and until there are ways to automatically adjust stake (and buy ram in the case of eos) we won‚Äôt really have complex autonomous decentralized applications in either of them.
