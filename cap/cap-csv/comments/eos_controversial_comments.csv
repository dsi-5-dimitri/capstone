0,"> Dan could not figure out how to create a bitcoin like product but he says he can improve it. 7:15

Nope, he says that he was looking for digital currencies, came across bitcoin, and brought up issues with Satoshi about how it was implemented. Thos issues were recently the cause of network congestion and high fees.

> Dan says ethereum is worthless BUT is using all the tools ethereum has to build EOS, because he could not figure out , how to make his own.Time stamp 28:05 & 31:52 At 32:38 says its built on Ethereum smart contract.

Nope, he says ethereum is worthless for most smart contracts because of prohibitive cost to the end user, is only using ethereum for crowd funding. Two of these timestamps are nothing, the third is very loosely related to the point you're failing to make.

> Dan does not own cryptocurrency as he does not believe in blockchain technology, he sells them for fiat. Time stamp 1:30:00

During this timestamp he's talking about memory leaks... Are any of these real timestamps?

> Dan has abandoned every thing he as worked on. Bitshares steemit, One of his biggest critics is former colleague Charles Hoskinson, who has ventured that Larimer “hasn’t finished a project yet.”

He has left the previous 2 projects because he didn't want to be a tyrant to the community. He has huge financial incentive to stick around with EOS. Everything he's built has been in preparation for this. Charles is a critic of EOS because he is a competitor.

> 2010 in which Satoshi Nakamoto famously retorted, in response to Larimer’s complaint that 10 minutes was too long for a block time, “If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.” The creator of blockchain technology flat out told dan he does not know what he is talking about.

That's great, but as above, Dan warned Satoshi of some of the problems bitcoin would face and it has recently run into these problems and left the bitcoin team scrambling to come up with workarounds. Satoshi is not a God.

> Bitshares was originally just another bitcoin clone because again he could not come up with his own ideas. time stamp 12:20

This timestamp he's talking about how he was experimenting with concepts from bitcoin, then goes on to say that he went back to the drawing board because it wasn't scalable. Wasn't trying to make a currency.

> Dan left bitshares because they ran out of money, zero sustainability, & He gave people the power to vote , and they voted against his wishes, dan did not like so he left. Time stamp 17.35 & at 24:36 almost says people are to stupid to vote.

He didn't say he didn't like what the community was doing, he said he had no money left to continue developing. If he wanted to extract value from the product, he could have, but he decided to move on because there was no funding.

> Created steemit to try and fix is mistakes with bitshares admitting that he left it broken. 18:56

Doesn't say this at all, says that the entry to bitshares was too steep and wanted to make something that anyone could use without having to know about bitcoin and blockchain.

> Steem and EOS have zero fees unlike ETH the reason ETH has fees is to prevent spamming the network , this is borrowed form pow. If you are going to bankrupt yourself trying attack someone ,you are most likely not even going to bother attacking them in the first place.This also makes ETH A.I resistant for same reason. EOS does not have this protection. Time Stamp 19:44.

If you understood even the most basic details of EOS, then you'd know that everything you've said here is shit. EOS is a DPoS system, you cannot use more resources than you have tokens staked. You can run something that will spam the network, because it will only spam your percentage of the network and nothing else will slow down.

> Admits Steemit is broken and needs to be fixed at 25:31

He's talking here about how he cannot fix Steemit because it's an existing system, and he can't make changes to something that a lot of people are already invested in. Everything can be improved, nothing is perfect, this is Dan reflecting on an imperfect system that he doesn't have involvement with anymore. I don't see an issue here.

> Eos will be using DPOS which is carried over from bitshares because yet again he could not imagine anything better. Timp stamp 30:21

This entire timestamp he's talking about Ethereum sharding, nothing to do with DPoS. Either way, what's wrong with using a system that you like? Your God, Charles, took the PoS idea from Dan for Cardano.

> Eos will be centralized to 21 people with data centers ( the more centralized the faster it is , this is just a general fact) Time Stamp 36:41 Says centralized is better Time stamp 37:47

EOS appears centralised because of it's rules with staking. Is in fact more fair, because it doesn't fall into the issue with mining pools becoming too big as has [happened in Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://steemit-production-imageproxy-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmbg4pLMwXsDn4TSZqsxU18dGzWwFnpysgxbKX2TZKWAVg).

> Says that Eos is ANY OTHER oligarchy ( Government by a few, especially by a small faction of persons ) time stamp 40:36

The direct quote is ""I don't believe that bitshares or DPoS creates any more oligachy than any other system out there."" You kidding mate?  It's 4:30 am, wtf am I doing awake trying to fight FUD with someone who hasn't even listened to the interview.

> all the eos token money out there is NOT for the development of eos it goes into the pocket of dan 43:12

The proceeds are not going towards the development of EOS, instead they are being used to fund the development of dapps on the platform. He's explaining here that they do have external investors making the start up and development of EOS possible.

> EOS is going to have a LOT of hard forks, of course just like bitcoin everyone will wonder what is the real EOS? time stamp. Time stamp 44:05

EOS is open source, anyone can start their own chain. Much like how people took bitcoin and made Litecoin, Dogecoin, CoinYe, Garlicoin... There will be one chain that is more widely adopted than any others.

Also, most mission critical system software is currently written in C++ fighter jets, high frequency trading software, you fucking name it. Companies dont care about the language tbh. They care about who is writing it. Now Linus Torvalds may think that way but the industry clearly prefers C/C++ programmers for mission critical systems. It is likely that they will prefer that these programmers with experience writing mission critical system to write their smart contracts.

And what language do these programmers know? thats right C++. Also dude, do you know what a transpiler is?

As for Charles Hoskinson, his track record is an even larger red flag: ETH, LISK, ZEN, BTS, ETC all had issues with him. Now he's working with ADA while juggling with ETC. 

I'll understand if its 1 or 2 projects that have a problem with Charles, but damn its too many to ignore. They cant all be lying about Charles being a problem.

I'm more confident with EOS since it has the backing of Novogratz's hedge fund and other huge players. Funding & ecosystem > Peer-review

1.Dan could not figure out how to create a bitcoin like product but he says he can improve it. 7:15

He figured out how to make two blockchains that are both better than bitcoin. Third one will be EOS.

2.Dan says ethereum is worthless BUT is using all the tools ethereum has to build EOS, because he could not figure out , how to make his own.Time stamp 28:05 & 31:52 At 32:38 says its built on Ethereum smart contract.

Etheruem is good but at the end of the day, got smashed by cryptokitties. Scalability issues for ethereum is 2-5 years away.
Eos sale is built on etherum smart contract because it is currently the best ICO method.

3.Dan does not own cryptocurrency as he does not believe in blockchain technology, he sells them for fiat. Time stamp 1:30:00
Lol. He said he owns steem and bitshares. This is a good sign actually, why would you want the boss of a company buying their competitors shares? 

4.Dan has abandoned every thing he as worked on. Bitshares steemit, One of his biggest critics is former colleague Charles Hoskinson, who has ventured that Larimer “hasn’t finished a project yet.”
I have quit every job I have had apart from my current one. Who cares?

    2010 in which Satoshi Nakamoto famously retorted, in response to Larimer’s complaint that 10 minutes was too long for a block time, “If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.” The creator of blockchain technology flat out told dan he does not know what he is talking about.

Satoshi didn't account for cryptokitties it seems. 

    Bitshares was originally just another bitcoin clone because again he could not come up with his own ideas. time stamp 12:20

No one is saying Dan Larimer invented the blockchain - eos will just be better than most chains in existance upon launch. The crucial point is what is the better tech, we just need to wait and see.  

7.Dan left bitshares because they ran out of money, zero sustainability, & He gave people the power to vote , and they voted against his wishes, dan did not like so he left. Time stamp 17.35 & at 24:36 almost says people are to stupid to vote.

You are probably right here, but why is this a terrible thing?

    Created steemit to try and fix is mistakes with bitshares admitting that he left it broken. 18:56

I think the tech behind those chains is great but governance perhaps not so much, so point taken they were broken in a way. This has to be an iterative process, still new technology we are playing with.

If you are going to bankrupt yourself trying attack someone ,you are most likely not even going to bother attacking them in the first place.This also makes ETH A.I resistant for same reason. EOS does not have this protection. Time Stamp 19:44.

Yes it does. You need to stake eos in order to use it. Network will guarantee service proportional to staked eos. If you spam the network with as much bandwidth as you are entitled to, nothing happens. 

    Admits Steemit is broken and needs to be fixed at 25:31

As above. 

    Eos will be using DPOS which is carried over from bitshares because yet again he could not imagine anything better. Timp stamp 30:21

No other consensus mechanism delivers the required goals. Unless you have a better one?

    Eos will be centralized to 21 people with data centers ( the more centralized the faster it is , this is just a general fact) Time Stamp 36:41 Says centralized is better Time stamp 37:47

He was talking about centralization relative to bitcoin or ethereum. Large mining pools control the majority of these networks.
He said decentralization comes with a cost which is accurate.

    all the eos token money out there is NOT for the development of eos it goes into the pocket of dan 43:12

Yes you are right about this, they can chose to do what they want with the money. He has only guarenteed the software will be availible by June.
Block one did just drop 1 billion directly on eos dapp development. I believe that this won't be the only money that goes directly into the platform by June, but we'll see.

    EOS is going to have a LOT of hard forks, of course just like bitcoin everyone will wonder what is the real EOS? time stamp. Time stamp 44:05
It may have hard forks, but the real eos will become clear if the chain is using the eos token snapshot. (PS. the best time to buy tokens that on chains that fork is before the fork not after :)) In a sense the more forks, the better from an investment standpoint because your tokens will be valid on all of them.

16 You will forced trigger capital gains tax or be dropped from the network if you do nothing with your keys for 30 days Holders not welcome. Time stamp 46:06

I think this was refering to account recovery, I cant remember the exact details of how this works, I assume they will make account recovory optional anyway. 

    You will have to prove your ID with real id OR RDIF CHIP basicly some type of Goverment issued in order to participate in eos 46:33 also at 50:56

He was refering to the crypto space in general, not neccessary EOS. You do not need any ID to use EOS.

    Ability to change blockchain whenever they feel like. if someone steals your identity and convinces Eos that , they will give the hacker all your funds. Time Stamp 47:50

All of these things will be up to the block producers who can be kicked out at any time by voting, corrupt block producers won't last very long.

    Eos uses a timeshare method which means that when eos gets busy you will not be able to send transactions out when you need it most , it will simply block you form network thinking its an attack. Also we know AIRb&b rents out timeshares all the time, imagine if we do this with eos to launch an attack it will work as we now have majority power just buy playing the game with the rules in place. Time stamp 48:22

No this is wrong. You first stake your eos, then you are entitled to use a certain amount of bandwidth, storage etc. If not many people use their bandwidth, storage etc then you can use thiers. You can get a guarenteed amount of network resources by staking eos. 

    Admits that they will bend to will of the state at 51:12

Sometimes the will of the state could use a bit of bending.

    Copys both bitcoin and ethereum to create all of his work gets mad when cardano supposable does the same thing to him. Even though cardano has been working on that for years before eos was even an idea Time stamp 52:30

He doesn't seem that mad about it.

    Admits giving more regular people power in network is a bad thing and should remain centralized . Time stamp 52:51

Nope.

    Increase the length of time to reach consensus Because everyone has a say unlike eos where the elite rulers that are smarter than you because they were richer get to control everything, without you having any say in the matter. 53:17

Are we watching the same video?

    Thinks giving millions of ada stake holder a vote will lead to centralized power unlike only allowing 21 people on earth to vote. time stamp 53:28

Everone with an eos token gets to vote on block producers.

    Would it be easier to buy/blackmail 21 people or millions of people to get control of the system??? Time stamp 53:32

Ok you are just misinformed here, read the white paper.
As for your C++ rant, you are clearly not a professional programmer, C++ is still around after so many years because it is good.

22,"In defense, C++ is not the only language that can be transfered to Web Assembly. This means that you can code in whatever language you want, and get the web-assembly at the end. I am 100% sure that C++ engine is just a start, and it is the way many programing languages and OS-es started too. It is a first step in a right direction.  Nevertheless, I agree, C++ is not the right technology for many things. Just because it is old, it does not mean it does not work or is improper. Fortran is the best example of such a language, yet it accomplishes the complicated calculations at the speed of light in comparison to other languages. EOS is not a product, it is a tool. As such it will need more than 4 years to fully mature. In the meantime Ethereum might solve the scalability issue, but EOS holders will look at it as the thing of the distant past, and that is the main point that you missed. The rest of the things you mentioned is an internal matter that any company-like structure deals with on a daily basis.

46,"I don't know about the programming bits as I'm not a programmer, just an interested individual. I trust Ivan too, but Dan has been in the blockchain space for 9 years now and I see no reason not to believe there is a purpose behind his choices.

Is there any risk with him bending to governments will? There is no need for forking, because the block producers can upgrade on the fly to any new changes (must be voted in by 17/21 by the block producers), and if the change is unfavourable, then the community can change their votes to a different producer. Any block producers that do not upgrade once a change is voted in are pushed out and replaced by a block producer that follows the rules.

The idea behind identity on the chain is to stop people stealing your assets. If every transaction is accountable to a face and a name, then the incentive to steal is diminished because you'll always know who did it, and you can open a dispute against them. You can privatise your balance and other assets stored on chain, but not your actions. Accountability is hugely important for a chain looking to replace perhaps major financial institutions and payment methods. Anonymity will only cause trust issues in trying to get EOS adopted.

The block production time is only 6 seconds, the window for attack is very small, given that there are even any attack vectors to take advantage of. An anonymous block producer reduces trust in the system, and increases the potentiality of bad actors.",18-02-11-00-26,1,11672,Zombait,7wlf49

So how would buying EOS with other currencies work? So if you buy stolen EOS, you're shit outta luck? Are they working on standards used in cases like this? I think there needs to be a period where you can file a dispute. For every EOS amount sold in exchange for another currencies, that same amount needs to be set aside in escrow in case it's stolen. If it's stolen the amount in escrow is given to the EOS buyer.

This is an assertion that is often repeated but never backed up by anything other than naive presumptions. Miners need an income, they don't mine just for fun. Further, the miners in the mining pool are not just a large set of people with uniformly distributed hashpower--there's often a handful of important parties.

What do you think a ""majority attack"" is exactly?  Would you agree that it means over 51% of the total hashpower?  Hopefully you're following along so far..

Here's an interesting fact - mining pools don't own their hash power.  They pay other people to mine for them, then divide the earnings out evenly.  That's the whole point of them really.

Hopefully we've established the fact that miners can change pools or simply choose to mine for themselves at this point, so I don't have to make this any more of a waste of my time than it already is.

So, assuming a pool(s) start a 51% attack, what do you think happens?  People mining for those pools stop, change pools, or mine for themselves.  It stands to reason that the malicious pool would then no longer have 51% of the hashpower then, wouldn't it?

A user activated soft fork (UASF, or user-activated soft fork), in the context of bitcoin, was a plan to activate a bitcoin soft fork on a specified date and enforced by a majority of full nodes rather than relying on miners. In order to succeed, participating nodes must have represented a so-called ""economic majority"" - users, exchanges and businesses with significant influence over the bitcoin economy. A UASF requires developer, industry and user coordination. In the past, a UASF was successfully carried out to activate the P2SH soft fork (aka BIP16).

359,"I hate responding to this because you appear to already have made up your mind, but you got me. 

The investment structure would be determined by the nature of the project. So the Dapp creators could potentially keep shares. They can also monetize their app in other ways. There are a lot of for instances, but really just think of any web monetization as potentials. 

The model you're referring to is for select developers. It's desirable to jumpstart the ecosystem to have a few Dapps like this. But this model is completely flexible. ",18-01-17-21-07,1,91,tastybreadman,7r00y5
360,"1)The ICO funds belong to Block.One as revenue.  If they invest it, the return should be 100% kept by them.  I hope we can agree that none of the ico tokenholders are shareholders of Block.One.  Therefore, the shareholders of BlockOne have no reason to share their returns on invested capital with EOS tokenholders. 

2)ROI is the return on investment for the VC funds.  The announcement suggests that the return will come in the form of the future value of airdropped tokens of DApps. 10% of these airdropped tokens go back to Block One and 90% go to EOS tokenholders.  This breaks point one because now most of the returns go to EOS tokenholders.  

You can see how this looks like a scam announcement.  Someone explain how this can work! ",18-01-17-21-07,1,21,iceman168,7r00y5
361,"With Dapps, the medium of exchange for the core service is the utility token.  There is no longer a central organization that extracts ""profits"" on the services in the traditional sense.  Users of the service purchase the tokens and speculators can bid on the value of the tokens on the exchanges.  Together, this supply/demand establishes a market value for the tokens which provides a financial return for the Dapp developers as well as speculators.  In a pre-ICO, VC firms have a chance to purchase tokens and then hope to resell them at a later date to the public at a higher price. 

If utility tokens are ""airdropped"" to existing EOS tokenholders for free, the effect will be dilutive to any investor (ie B1) who paid funds for the tokens.  Thus, this business model is pretty much nonsensical.



",18-01-17-21-07,1,21,iceman168,7r00y5
362,"because block.one is investing in the EOS ecosystem. They are doing that by investing in innovation/VC funds, and through distribution of DApp air dropped coins to token holders. Just like the original EOS token supply, they'll hold 10% of EOS-based DApp coins.

How is the EOS ecosystem/success of DApps  built on EOS gonna work if none of their tokens go to the consumers? They are ensuring the success of the EOS platform. If all block.one did was keep all of the revenue.. that would greatly diminish the product

edit: Also block.one is reinvesting 1billion dollars into VC funds, not 100% of capital. I think at the Seoul announcement they said they've raised $1.1 billion already, and the ICO still has some time to go",18-01-17-21-07,1,2092,rrizing,7r00y5
363,"Incorrect. This is the traditional model for Dapps yes. But this is not the only model of monetization possible, nor is it the one that EOS is exclusively promoting.

If there is another model of monetization, say using the the same Duber token for plumbing services, then it is no longer a utility token but a currency because there will be a translation costs between transport services and plumbing services.

If you think crypto is going to gain mainstream adoption by stubbornly adhering to fringe ideologies that hold no weight in the real world you're dreaming. Just as Dan recognized that immutability is a bad idea for complex software in the real world, he also recognizes that uncompromising political ideals are a bad idea for real world economic systems.",18-11-13-06-09,9,121,Memec0in,9wgzlo

400,"EOS was never meant to be a currency. It's digital real estate for the network hence the three resource model. DPOS can only work with an inflationary model. And POW is far too slow  (albeit arguably more decentralized ) to run dapps - this is why ETH sucks as a dapp platform but is pretty good as a currency. EOS was always intended to blend governance and decentralization.  EOS is an ultra high speed dapp development platform with governance baked in and the first of its kind with no other platform even approaching the same level of performance and features. You might have misunderstood it from the beginning my friend.

And the URI is just re-routing the worker proposal fund back to the token holders anyway, not a concern even if it does actually go through.",18-11-13-06-09,5,247,Hillary4EvnMorePrisn,9wgzlo
401,"Don't confuse two types of inflation.  Eos at 4% is referring to increase in the # of coins.  Usd inflation is referring to general price increases.  Eos inflation in terms of what it could buy could easily be negative, even with a 4% increase in coins.  In terms of printing/creating usd, inflation there is way way way higher than 4%.    If I had to guess usd monetary inflation is probably 10 to 20%.",18-11-13-06-09,5,6977,Mattay252,9wgzlo
402,"Since I didn't see anyone mention it, you are wrong about one other thing- the inflation of the dollar. 2-3% is the inflation in comparable purchasing power of the dollar, but the actual newly created supply is much higher. 

If you knew where to store your EOS you can make .1-1% inflation every single day on your money. These opportunities are growing and coming along faster and faster. 

If you're smart you'd get in before REX and URI, diversify into good EOS projects and forks, and hodl long. 

Finally I'll suggest you consider what's going to happen to people when every single driving job, factory job, and many more are taken by AI and automation. 50% in just 14 years some have said. URI will be needed, bad. The reason its not the same as the tax system is that the tax is involuntary and only will be felt by those who are quite wealthy- and all they will have to do is overcome a 4% per year inflation which they should be able to do with REX alone. 

That said, I also believe URI will come from other sources than just inflation, from the complex functions of the Facebook replacement ID based social network, such as advertising and the optional sale of data to companies. 

it sounds crazy today but thats why its going to be super lucrative to be able to say you were in. It may or may not work out but hey it might be kind of cool to be the guy on twitter who wished he didn't sell BTC at $.80 when it went to $11

403,"As others have mentioned, EOS is not a ""currency"" in the way you are insisting, it is an token for the allocation of digital resources specifically for computing purposes. Now you can take those resources and build currencies on top all day but it's a mistake to think of it any other way. Oh and you also get a community that is dedicated to ""making things right"". I write software for a living, I will never trust any system that makes code the absolute law, there is just too much room for error.

>A 4% inflation on EOS would outrace the current 2-3% inflation rate of the USD. So, why stop using centralized USD if the alternative is worse at retaining value?

You are mixing the measured inflation with growth of token supply. If you want to compare 2% USD inflation with EOS, you need to look at the actual change in price, not the token supply. And if you want to compare token supply, you need to look at how much new dollars have been printed (large percentage of them are not circulating in the economy so they don't have an effect on the measured inflation).

If you look at how much cryptocurrency prices fluctuate during a year, 5% inflation in token supply is nothing compared to that. If the value of a currency rises 5% in a year, the 5% growth in token supply has been nullified. I would assume that successful blockchain tokens will have a lot more than 5% growth in value. If the token price rises more than 100% in one year, that has nullified the token supply growth effect for many years in to the future.

It's weird to see how many people mix these two different concepts. Yeah, they are both called ""inflation"", but it should be easy to understand the difference if you know even a little bit economics.

>The weirdest part about this URI thing is that Dan calls himself an anarcho-capitalist.

There is nothing weird in trying to create an organization which intends to change the world to a better place. This is like saying that it's somehow anti-ancap to donate money for charity.

As long as everything happens in voluntary basis, it's inside the general framework of anarcho-capitalism.

>Granted, it's just a facial scan and your name. But this is plenty enough information for the government to track EVERYTHING you do on EOS.

Governments do that already. During the times of Bitshares 0.x Dan still supported privacy features on blockchains, but then he changed his mind. Apparently he learned how powerful big data analysis can be. So he abandoned the idea of privacy on the blockchain and started to support radical transparency. In his opinion, it's much better to be intentionally transparent rather than have false sense of privacy.

If you really want to retain full privacy on the internet nowadays, you really need to put a lot of effort in it. Most people are not ready to do that.

>With all this in mind, I hope Dan gets over this socialist nonsense, before he devalues EOS and forces his followers to invest in other assets that won't inflate out of existence.

Dan is just one community member in EOS. While many respect his opinions, he doesn't have the power to dictate how EOS should evolve. For example, there is a considerable opposition to URI, if it's funded from EOS inflation. I oppose it too at this point, because it's still very general and abstract idea. There are no concrete plans how to implement it, so it doesn't make any sense to put it on a blockchain right now.

All governance is a mess. And all coins have governance whether you want to admit it or not. That is pretty much why I have always felt that the argument from the angle that on chain governance is somehow fundamentally different from other coins.
With that said I still object to people being able to seize coins. Its pointless to do this kind of stuff because you reduce the value of the coin for everyone in the name of saving 10 grand. Its fucking bullshit.",18-11-13-06-09,2,1,eosforumbot,9wgzlo

""If it's voluntary it's libertarian""

No. Libertarians are economically literate. 

""Muh two kinds of inflation""

My point was, the USD inflates at 2-3% in OUR hands, so pragmatically, we would want a cryptocurrency that was better than this. 

""But cryptocurrencies rise faster than 5% inflation.""

The reason cryptocurrencies even rise in price is because they are seen to have long-lasting utility, and if you are aware that a cryptocurrency will devalue itself faster than your local fiat currency eventually,  you are conceding that your speculation of that cryptocurrency is structured like a pyramid scheme, ready to pull out after you make your hoped for gains and before it's too late. Bitcoin on the other hand will still increase in value past global adoption due to deflation, since coins can only be lost and not created new.

""It's not mandatory because you can just not participate in EOS""

Once again, concepts don't have to be in a coercive political framework to be anti-libertarian from a fundamental point of view. You know what I meant, I meant that there will be no opt-out on EOS and your data will be rendered to the government to exploit. I listed this as a severe disadvantage, with anti-utility if you value fungibility, privacy, and staying away from oppressive government. You saying it's not anti libertarian since it's voluntary is a strawman. Plenty of voluntary things are anti-libertarian,like voting, willingly paying taxes and filling out the paperwork, running for political office, and enlisting in the military even if it's just for defense, and welfare.

""Governments do that already""

To some extent. But Bitcoin is a nightmare to track, and a lot of coins are adopting privacy features, severing traceable connections. Furthermore, it is possible to anonymously use Bitcoin if your address isn't connected to an exchange with KYC, or do it p2p. It's also possible to anonymize your current activity by using the ""Monero transfer trick"" on your Bitcoin in order to send your Bitcoin from one address to another without the government knowing where you sent it. We've been working on privacy, but Dan is trying to make it easier for government.

Finally, I would like to point out once again that there is no reason to invest in an inflationary coin more inflationary than your local fiat dollar if a non inflationary version of it exists. Telos alone removes the reason to invest in EOS. It wouldn't be hard to fork EOS so that another non inflationary version exists. Inflationary currencies are not a good thing to invest in, and long term speculators agree with that. Dan is trying to force his ecosystem to have an Inflationary model with ideals such as ""if you don't work past the inflation then you have to work harder to retain value. See, that's economical"". So why not just migrate to a deflationary cryptocurrency then? Unless Dan can create and maintain a cult following, he can't successfully manhandle any ecosystem to suffer inflation THIS high.

If EOS implements a UBI, I WILL not be touching EOS, and I will be taking out my basic resource inheritance, and dumping it for privacy coins. Many people in their right mind will. We will be preceding adoption, and we will get the largest payout from doing it. All the people doing this will be causing EOS's price to drop.",18-11-13-06-09,1,394,cryptacritic17,9wgzlo

>  
>My point was, the USD inflates at 2-3% in OUR hands, so pragmatically, we would want a cryptocurrency that was better than this.

OK, let's try to look at this a little closer. 2-3% inflation for USD means that one dollar buys approximately 2-3% worth less goods and services after a year. There are many things that will have effect on this, like monetary supply, velocity, is it recession/boom, etc. But basically it's just supply and demand.

Growing the monetary supply means that there will be more units on the markets to answer the demand. If there are more new units than the demand is, the value of the unit will get lower, which we call ""inflation"". People can buy less goods and services with one unit than year ago.

But we must understand that new supply is just one affecting thing here. Demand is the another. For example, a lot of USD are used also in other countries for international trade. If all those other folks would decide to use some another currency and sell their dollars, the result would be inflation even if FED didn't print any new dollars that year.

Or if there is a economic crisis and people around the world think that USD is the most trusted currency and start using it instead of their own county's currency, the demand will get high and there is deflation.

Now, let's look at cryptocurrencies through the same model. It shouldn't be too hard to see that the new token supply has very little effect for most cryptos. The demand side of the equation is much more meaningful. Whether the value goes up or down, the reason is usually change in demand and not growth of the total amount of tokens (unless it's some kind of scam).

The inflation/deflation is pretty easy to measure, just check the price of token in dollars at the beginning and the end of the year. That's the measured inflation, comparable to 2-3% USD inflation. That's how much purchasing power changes.

If the price of cryptotoken has gone up 100% (which is not unusual), the purchasing power of token has gone also up approximately the same amount. If we want to be exact, we can subtract the USD inflation because cryptotokens are usually priced in USD. So then there has been about 97-98% deflation when compared how much goods and services can be purchased with one unit of token.

>Inflationary currencies are not a good thing to invest in, and long term speculators agree with that.

It depends completely how the inflation is used. Many blockchains can be compared to businesses. They have a product and they want to sell it to new users. Inflation is like a company issuing new shares and using the money to fund growth (development, marketing, etc.). If the blockchain community can use the funds effectively so that the benefit (more demand) is greater than the cost (new tokens) the project is successful. It's investment, not waste.

Deflationary currencies need to find some another way of funding everything, and that has been very difficult in the past. Blockchains are not well run when funding comes from charity.",18-11-13-06-09,1,152,Samupaha,9wgzlo

When statists say this, they of course have bad intentions. That's because they know it's pretty much impossible to create new countries. All statists hate competition so they usually fight against all new countries.

It's completely different thing to say ""if you don't like it then leave"" when the other guy has realistic chances of doing that, compared to the situation when it's impossible.

Unfortunately any voting mechanism can be gamed easily. Imagine a network of accounts that nobody can ban since there is no authority to ban anyone. This network auto-upvote their own posts, defeating most (real) downvote pressure. If you do it the right way, if you are patient and wait until you gain enough accounts to have a huge influence, you can become the (viagra) king of any social network. It's not even hard. Not even captchas or fees (yuck! who would want that when you have free?!) can stop that.

Evidence of absence is evidence of any kind that suggests something is missing or that it does not exist.

Per the traditional aphorism, ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance of that which should have been found already, had it existed. In this regard Irving Copi writes:



In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.

They don't want to buy more EOS as they are already trying to distance themselves from the EOS network and definitely don't want more controlling power until regulatory clarifications. That would never happen any time soon. Especially with the risk of being accused of not only meddling with the network but price manipulation. Not only that, EOS IO was not designed to hold large amounts of EOS without using them. It would help kill network performance.

If block.one intended to drop EOS IO software development, they would have stopped their updating, their involvement, QA's with BP's, partnerships, million dollar hackathons a long time ago and begun a EOS sell off. Huge investors and respected partners like Peter Thiel, Mike Novingratz, SVK Crypto and Thomas Cox would not be associated with any of this if this was just some shady operation trying to get your Fiat. Triple A game studios would not be onboarding into a scam. This is all crazy conspiracy nonsense.

Times have changed with how new ideas are funded. Adapt or move on. B1's treasury is much more of a bullish signal than a threat. We literally just received an update that the official B1 wallet will use an option that allows transactions without staked EOS. The network resources will automatically be leased from the new Rex system and a small transaction fee will be charged. These fees go to EOS holders. This means users will now have a choice of free transactions or just use EOS like anything else is used. This opens a ton of ideas and takes down the complexity of using EOS  to the point that anyone can use it while leaving advanced options that save on network costs. Dapp services will be able to tap into these features and easily cover the transactions of their users without worry of bottlenecking. These dapp services could even onboard new users without requiring them to use an EOS wallet. These are ideas and systems that you aren't hearing from any other projects. It takes a lot of time and money to make things like this possible. That's only because B1 raised that money and was smart enough to manage their treasury as well as designing the most active blockchain in history. 

Only a true fudster or someone absolutely consumed by misinformation can attempt to paint a picture that it's a bad thing the developing company behind the now very popular EOS IO software raised a lot of money. Enough money that EOSIO development could easily be funded for decades in parallel to dapp services/applications that take advantage of EOS IO. Also, the last time I checked, Eth was down from over $1,200 to near 75 bucks. You know... The coin that's just so amazing because it didn't start through an ICO (Though, they did ask for money.). Looks like that doesn't really seem to matter in the current market state.

There are different layers of censorship and immutability that need to be developed for a robust well rounded internet to exist. Firstly these are private businesses not public utilities. They have the right to govern their platforms as they see fit. 

I'm happy that they choose to limit the speech of lunatic shit bags like Alex Jones. This is the first wave of the social internet, and again it's controlled by private businesses that curate content to create tailored experiences. This is their right.

There are going to be some incredibly interesting arguments that take shape over the next decade as these utility platforms come to prominence.

I called you a useful idiot, which is defined as a person who cheers for the opposing team. A term coined by Soviet leadership in reference to Americans who supported them.

>I believe that private businesses have the right to curate the content they host is less than useful.

No one is denying that they're within their rights. It's completely besides the point. 

>Now should there be an open source immutable version of youtube that's considered a public resource? And who in society should have access to the content? How should highly disturbing content be categorized if at all?

That's precisely the problem that EOS solves. Censorship is possible, but only if everyone agrees on it; we won't have a small handful of self-appointed politically motivated dictators deciding what content should be available to the entire internet.

If a cloud provider decides for any reason that they want to disallow use of their network for EOS then it would take down a section of the network proportional to how many BPs were running on that provider.

So, there is definitely a significant reason to ensure that the *majority* aren't based in the cloud - which simply put is a bunch of servers owned by someone else.

From a purely objective perspective, EOSIO is the only chain software that provides what we need, in real-time, right now - scalability, real-time smart contract transactions and an incredible community that is pounding out updates at a feverish pace.

It is vastly cheaper to run on eos.

If it is spread over more years, you will be able to resell less of the 73k spend due to inflation, but still get many transaction out of the second year. So to answer your quesiton, cryptokitties would just be paying for inflation (something like 3700) for one year and users save on about $1 million in gas fees. None of this takes into account that instead of inflating, the effecting inflation may turn negative due to a collection of forces (ram/name sale/ exceess staking) furthermore, due to moores law, even if 5% of tokens are lost due to inflation, the transactions that those tokens are entitled to may increase by more than 5% - if this is the case, value of eos should too, so the cool thing about eos, when it is all said and done, a dev may end up paying nothing, or getting paid to stake - madness.",18-06-17-16-58,5,98,JuanaLaLoca,8rpfqh

now, if you look at some of the solutions that are being worked on in Ethereum you'll see that this will very likely not be the case. the solution partially comes from Holochain. EOS has this sense of Dan's jealousy and resentment to it that is just... ugh!

furthermore, if we go beyond blockchain and visit DAG land and IOTA, see how things work there, well - these problems are completely eliminated, they simply don't exist. the Tangle is more or less chaos and is how you take it, what you make it to be and this is only limited by your imagination - and yes, you have to think, learn and use your imagination there to make money. not just push a lever and make Bitcoin 3.0: everything bad about Bitcoin taken and made 10 times more efficiently worse.

1093,"For the specific case of running a decentralized application, which is the use case I’m interested in, IOTA and other DAGs don’t really work. I mean, you can use them for transmitting data in a secure and traceable manner, and byteball even has smart contracts. But, at least as far as I understand, there is no economic incentive for any people or groups to run powerful computers on the system, rather high transaction throughput is achieved by making each transaction validate two other transactions. This solves one problem, transaction speed, but is poor at achieving consensus. In addition, running a Dapp purely on a DAG like IOTA isn’t realistic, as each transaction is “mined” for a few seconds by someone trying to validate their transaction, meaning if you have 1000 users trying to interact with the Dapp at the same time, it will not reach proper consensus on ordering, and it will not behave deterministically, which is a major problem for any Dapp. That said, I’ve only taken a deep dive on Iota, and I’m not as familiar with Byteball, Nano, and Hashgraph, and I believe they each have slightly different DAG designs. 

When Dan Larimer speaks I find him pretty obnoxious, but he seems to have the exact goals for the EOS blockchain software as I am looking for in order to run a decentralized application. If there is any realistic alternative to EOS that will be available this year, I’d love to hear it. ",18-04-14-18-14,2,3524,Tsrdrum,8c69dg
1094,"I’m sorry I’m gonna try to not misunderstand your points but it’s difficult because of your nonsense stream-of-consciousness writing style. I’ll summarize the information you gave me and try to understand the points you’re making:

1. If we include all transactions, it will still look different (you mean the graph? Duh, it’s different data different graph)

2. Delegated Proof Of Stake: This is a problem and I know it (what is “this” that is the problem? DPOS itself, despite being successfully tested in steem?)

3. Ethereum has a societal components (I don’t even know what you are intending to convey with this statement)

4. Ethereum has attracted and is housing many different peoples and communities which work in many different ways and from many trans-disciplinary angles there. (Isn’t this true of any open-source technology with people who work on it? How does EOS not have this, when it is also open source and “housing many different people’s and communities”?)

5. ethereum has quite the vibrant culture 

None of these hastily thought out word salad sentences addresses the points that I’m primarily concerned with: 

1. The usability of a given solution in running a decentralized application or organization (tx/s + no transaction fees for users of your product + reversibility if a bad actor exploits bugs in your code)

2. The timeline of a given solution (should be able to test solutions now, should be able to use at scale within the year)

3. The ability to run the application back-end, the blockchain part, at scale. 

Ethereum only satisfies one of these desires, so its a no go. I refuse to create a decentralized organization that requires users pay fees in order to interact with. 

If you can give me info that shows ethereum will provide Dapp builders thousands of transactions per second without fees, and that if I accidentally code something that overflows its container it’s not going to wipe millions of dollars from users’ accounts, then I’ll pay more attention to ETH development. But so far ETH has only been used for ICOs, and as of my understanding can ONLY be used for online purchase Dapps and not social networks or anything like that, because each transaction requires gas, and nobody would use Facebook if they had to pay for each post.

I'm a software developer who has used both. Usability aside, Ethereum isn't even capable of doing half the things EOS is capable of on a technical level, and the EVM is orders of magnitudes slower. It's a complete nonstarter, like comparing DOS to Linux.

With that said, Solidity is an obscure, single-purpose language that no one knows outside of the Ethereum development community. C++ (and its C subset) on the other hand is the most ubiquitous language around, with an abundance of widely used and thoroughly tested libraries, which means that pretty much every software developer in the world can write contracts on the EOS platform right off the bat. No fumbling around with a new (bad) language that appeals to web developers who pretend to be software developers all the while re-inventing the wheel every time they need some common functionality. And from what I understand, Solidity will be (is?) capable of compiling to web assembly, so even if you're a masochist, you can still write EOS contracts in Solidity - or any other language that compiles to WA, which includes ""memory safe"" languages like Rust and Python.

If you don't see any reason, then perhaps there is none for you. Ethereum is entirely capable for some use cases that require neither speed nor scalability, and where you know will never need to fix a bug in the contract (i.e. very simple software).

If you cannot fully research and stay on top of a crypto project, then you should not invest in it. If you do invest, you must accept the risk.

It was very clear that anyone who invested took a risk that the ERC20 based token would become worthless once the ICO was done and the mainnet was launched.

There doesn't seem to be anywhere easily accessible to register for updates on the project on their main site. There is a blog that you can subscribe to, but that takes searching.

In my opinion it is poor user experience. Although it was certainly possible to keep up to date on the project, it required action on the end user that could be considered more than necessary. It is a problem easily alleviated, yet persisted. It directly turns off users, and causes them problems using the technology and out of the loop of significant changes in the product.

People had issues. If your first response to people who ran into issues, who clearly believed in the project enough to invest, is to levy insults and act like your shit don't stink, then you are building a foundation of shit for your ecosystem.

It's shady. But let's not forget that Brock Pierce was one of these teenage boys, not one of the accused molesters. Yes he was financed by them, and yes he publicly sided with them saying they were not guilty. But that can be for a myriad of reasons. 

On a side note Brock is a kooky guy. He is one of these modern hippies that believe their chakras will unite and take over the world. Maybe they will maybe they won't. But he's also an incredibly perceptive entrepreneur that has predicted, timed, and capitalized on many of the biggest trends in tech and leveraged them for his own gain. 

He isn't a show runner of EOS, he was the money man. Brock brought the big financial players to this platform because of his proven track record from Goldman Sachs to venture funds. He has access that most in block chain do not. He is most likely the reason that Mike Novogratz, Eric Schmidt, Lary Sanger, and Bittfinex found EOS so early. 

So yeah, in conclusion. Brock Pierce is incredibly sharp, but like many people with a laser focus in one area it's likely he can be incredibly naive in others. There is no evidence that he ever acted out of malice or actively tried to harm other teens back when he worked for Digital Entertainment Network. 

I get that he's a kooky guy with what some might consider to be naive beliefs. But don't underestimate him.

Listen I'm not arguing no one was involved with sketchy stuff. But the use of the word pedophilia is incorrect. You are talking about statutory rape. One of the most popular category of porn in the United States is ""teen."" There's a rreeaallly big difference between perving on sexually mature humans vs immature humans. Imagine if the most popular category in the US was ""child."" Okay now that's pedophilia!

1517,"Hi,

We tried to explain the problem we're solving in our website and whitepaper but perhaps it wasn't clear enough so let me clarify.

Are you familiar with augmented reality? Infiniverse is an augmented reality platform which lets us create a virtual world on top of the real world.

The problem is this: there are many great AR apps and games coming out but you can only use one at a time. Pokemon Go was very popular (and continues to have millions of daily active users). But how can we experience multiple AR apps simultaneously?

What if I don't want to just experience Pokemon? I want Pikachu fighting Harry Potter and Batman dancing with Homer Simpson. In Infiniverse, the world has no theme and all content is user created. We can experience all kinds of different themes and diverse content co-existing and interacting.

I focused on the gaming/entertainment aspect just now but it can be anything you can imagine. It could be interactive ads, digital art, educational use cases, AR concerts. It's all about creating a persistent digital layer on top of the real world full of weird and wonderful things, all co-existing. We're extending the whole world and hope some day people will be just as excited to go out and check out what's going on in the digital layer just as much as they are about the real world. It's like Second Life, but on top of the real world.",18-11-30-15-01,2,223,infiniverseAR,a1owuv

To me this paints the opposite picture of what people usually think about side chains. One token could actually have more value if more side chains are introduced.

Think about it... imagine one EOS network is one hotel and you own 5% of it. Now, if 9 new hotels are built and you own 5% in all 10 of them... is your ""token"" (ie. company ownership) more or less valuable ?  :)

The DApp producers can rent tokens if they find the cost of purchasing too high, likely still cheaper than gas on other systems.  Also the resources scale based on capacity.  If I have rights, either ownership or leased, to 1% of tokens, then I can use 1 % of system resources at any given time.

To recap what I've learned: parallel chains will grow the network potentially infinitely. If you own 1% of the network, you will own 1% of the original chain and every parallel chain. Because these chains are identical in every way, with inter-blockchain communication, we do not need to make new EOS tokens for each chain. The sum of all the parallel chains is the whole network, therefore whatever percentage of EOS you hold is the same percentage of network resources you control over all the parallel chains.

1617,"I agree, I was just using $10 as an example. Part of my point is that could be good for us if the price stays cheap. For EOS to succeed, Daap developers need to be able to afford the nework resources. If I'm correct, most of us have been thinking about the price of EOS incorrectly. The path to riches is a low EOS price, coupled with 1,000s of parallel chains. ",18-04-22-03-06,1,216,gstevv,8dx1v6

1621,"That's all very helpful, thanks for the response! What I'm talking about though is when the first EOS blockchain fills up it's capacity. The scaling solution presented by Dan Larimer is to start another chain in parallel, likely run by the same BP's that run the original chain. In effect, you just doubled the network's speed. Both chains are identical in every way, and can interoperate with each other. But since the network has doubled, I'm guessing that the EOS tokens have to double. 

If they don't, then nobody has ownership of the newly created parallel chain. ",18-04-22-03-06,1,216,gstevv,8dx1v6
1622,"Interesting. Thanks for clarifying. I'm not trying to be obstuse, but I'm still having a difficult time understanding.

1630,"The way I understand it, think of the side chains as having dual processors.  Since they can talk, you can split your transactions across both chains, no need for new token, the EOS token can be used for bandwidth across both, can be hosted by the same block producers, can be paid out of the same inflation.  It should all scale together.  They are simply extra power and really are acting like one mainchain.

Now you may be thinking about true side chains or almost more like forks.  These could be chains that choose a different form of governance, or constitution.  They may airdrop new tokens and act independently of the main chain (all chains that compute for mainchain).  They have their own BPs, own rules for inflation, arbitration or whatever.

1631,"All chains could use the same token as the basis for staking and resource allocation.

The token will not double. Simple way of looking at it is if eos = resource, for this example lets take on storage. If 1 eos = 100mb of storage. Then if you own 10 eos then that equates to 1gb of storage. Now that storage can be used on any chain. So if there is 10 chain running in parallel you wont magically gain 10gb of storage resource in total across all chain.",18-04-22-03-06,1,6,25bam,8dx1v6

If you own 1% of total tokens and new side chain is introduced which is using the SAME token distribution (which will be the case in many instances), then you still own 1% of EOS network, 1% of new side chain and 1% of TOTAL network. 

But, considering now the power of the TOTAL network with side chains is much bigger the value of your token is much higher. Why ? because your single private address has access to much greater computational power spread across the whole network.

More side chains (which reuse the same token distr.) are introduced, more value the whole network gets. Considering you have stake in all chains the value of your private EOS address goes up... a lot... ",18-04-22-03-06,3,360,tkosamja,8dx1v6

I can safely say that there has been not one anti EOS discussion or post on /r/CryptoCurrency that was fully accurate or not exaggerated. Most of them are so far from the truth that you'd need zero knowledge on EOS to fall for them.

The whole idea of blockchain is meant to remove 3rd party trust and being decentralised is to eliminate single point of failure. It was never meant to compete with traditional cloud infrastructure.

Blockchain by design is secure because all blocks are cryptographic linked to each other and because it is decentralised, hacking a single node does not affect the data stored in the blockchain.

""Right now, the Ethereum blockchain rules the roost when it comes to hosting dApps and defining standards. But deep-pocketed competitors—notably Tezos, Eos, and Dfinity—believe they can dethrone Ethereum by offering faster and more efficient protocols. So who will win?
To my surprise, CZ thinks none of the current contenders are poised for long-term success because they are too slow. While this criticism has long been leveled at Ethereum, CZ says any blockchain designed for general smart contracts (as the current competitors are) won’t be swift enough. Instead, he thinks the existing blockchains will cede the field to more specialized ones.
CZ cited newer tools like Komodo and Tendermint that make it possible to write blockchains for specific purposes, suggesting the future will consist of numerous bespoke ledgers.""

Why would block producers service a blockchain that not only doesn't pay them, but devalues their own holdings? The only way for this to work is for said big company to spend millions of dollars creating their own separate network of block producers, distribute their own token, and essentially exist as a completely stand-alone project/network with no ability to communicate with chains on the main EOS network. In this case, it's no longer a decentralized network and my as well just be a centrally controlled distributed database sans a blockchain. 

WAX is not building its own separate network. From their blog post:

1768,"Honestly, the twitter link didn't assuage my concern. It listed reasons why EOS is competitive, but not reasons why a company or group would actually utilize EOS tokens as opposed to creating their own side chain based on the software.

The first thought that came to mind when I read the article, was memories of similar arguments being made against Ether last year. The concern was, companies would simply copy the code from Ethereum to make their own private chains. This would mean purchasing Ether would be unnecessary, thereby limiting the value of the token.

The counterpoint to this argument in the context of Ethereum, was that using the main Ethereum blockchain is beneficial because the Ethereum chain is composed of a larger network of computers which have been maintaining the ledger for a longer period of time. (The bigger the network and older the ledger = greatest security). Therefore, companies are incentivized to use the main Ethereum chain, because the ledger is more secure.

Not sure the same argument can be said for EOS? I don't see why not?

The way I see it is, once the EOS code is mature enough to meet the needs of an app, the only reason to stay on the main chain(s) is to increase security.  The more funds that are invested in a given chain, the more resources it will take to influence/corrupt it.   So, by WAX going on their own chain, they become more vulnerable to corruption than if they stayed on the main chain.  On the other hand, they can modify it and,presumably, make money by keeping a fraction of the coins for themselves.  ",18-04-18-01-28,1,18,mathfanEM,8cxeau

Large companies and institutions may well have the resources and user base to create a completely independent chain using the EOS software. One of those may may eventually become the dominant chain, limiting the value of existing tokens.

This is different from other existing open source blockchain projects where there is an already established main chain with attendant security benefits.  In addition to that, most existing chains have a structure for improving the main chain. In contrast, EOS has a company, block.one, that is happy to support any chain, not just those that support the ICO. This seems highly opportunistic.

I think EOS has the best technology and the best deployment of that technology, and the article doesn't contest that. Instead, it focuses on what people are actually building on top of all available smart contract networks and which ones seem to be attracting the most high-quality users, and it's also discussing what high-quality gaming is.

This blockchain technology thing is going to become commodity soon. What will matter in terms of the valuation wars is usage. One thing that EOS could do is go the Intel route and continue to aggressively innovate in the tech aspect, so they're never a commodity. To achieve that they should do IBC immediately and shard the main chain.

EOS New York was posting recently about a sort of ""immutability certification,"" which I think is something that should be required by any intelligent ""investor"" in these gambling joints.

Despite the revenue generated and trading activities on EOS have surpassed ETH for now, we can hardly say that EOS is anywhere close to where ETH ecosystem is. **In fact, judging from the angle of diversity and complexity, DApps on ETH score way better.** Truth is that while EOS has better performance on the gambling category, ETH is not disadvantaged at all when it comes to collectible games or strategy games that do not require high interaction frequency.  
>  
>Furthermore, the network effect of ETH is global, whereas EOS seems to have captured attention mostly from Asia. The majority of EOS DApp players are in China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. As DAppReview communicated with some developers and players overseas, we found that many of them did not follow EOS at all or were not aware of the EOS DApp explosion over the past 2 months, and that really said something about the next step for the EOS ecosystem. **We truthfully look forward to more types of games and applications, and more new users from other regions to joining the ecosystem, and eventually mass adoption.**

The projects he creates seem to get better(bts) and better(steem) and better(eos). I wouldn’t expect that to change. The only thing i don’t like about eos and any other crypto or anything with potential value is that it always benefits the investors and whales. The little guy still only gets the crumbs. Albeit the crumbs in crypto are much bigger then that of a centralized world where paycheck to paycheck is way of life for the majority.

In the UK costing me $8,000 - 1BTC. I have multiple businesses so can take the hit. But it is not a waste! Without the miners you have nothing - they keep the blockchain secure and Bitcoin is the tide that keeps all other cryptos afloat. Admittedly the tide is out right now.  But right now there is no ALT that can standalone. Moreover PoW, which burns the electricity and you think a ""huge waste"", makes the BTC blockchain the most secure - nothing even comes close so far and other consensus models are experimental or untested. Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Authority (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Rely (PoR), Proof of Burn (PoB) etc etc have not been battle tested. It is unfortunate so much power is required but there are moves to use solar and hydro power. But it that wasn't the case burning the electricity, which equates to what New Zealand burns, is not a huge waste. Without it we have no crypto, no 4th industrial revolution, no overhaul of the financial system, no access to basic financial services for billions.

We still need the btc exposure. However, if we can get to the point where the top alts can almost as easily be converted from fiat to <insert crypto>, without having to go through btc then I will say that btc mining is a waste. Factually there are better alts from a pure tech perspective that should rather be used than btc, but they still have to go through the implementation phase btc already went through.

As for the claim ""the banking system can destroy"" [BTC]. If they could they would, they haven't because the cannot.

No, you don't have to enter your private key anywhere publicly. You use a cryptographic function that you can find yourself in the eosjs\-ecc repository \(made by BlockOne\), write a transaction according to the official format, and then use the cryptographic function to sign your message with the private key offline. At no point do you have to communicate your private key to anyone. Once you have the signed transaction, you run a node on their blockchain and propagate your transaction to the rest of the network. EvolutionOS does not come in contact with your private key.

Naturally, there will be software to make the signing process easier, but you can just use software developed by BlockOne. Alternatively, you can make your own based on the specs. In any case, you don't share your private key with anyone ever.",18-05-11-02-08,2,3045,stop-making-accounts,8ig28e

2313,"Posted this elsewhere. Looks to be pretty relevant here as well. 


In regards to Digital Entertainment Network. 

When Brock Pierce was a teenager he came up with an idea for a pre cursor to youtube. He was funded by some older men to make it become a reality. These older men are accused of hosting parties in the name of this company where they took advantage of teenage boys. 

It's shady. But let's not forget that Brock Pierce was one of these teenage boys, not one of the accused molesters. Yes he was financed by them, and yes he publicly sided with them saying they were not guilty. But that can be for a myriad of reasons. 

On a side note Brock is a kooky guy. He is one of these modern hippies that believe their chakras will unite and take over the world. Maybe they will maybe they won't. But he's also an incredibly perceptive entrepreneur that has predicted, timed, and capitalized on many of the biggest trends in tech and leveraged them for his own gain. 

He isn't a show runner of EOS, he was the money man. Brock brought the big financial players to this platform because of his proven track record from Goldman Sachs to venture funds. He has access that most in block chain do not. He is most likely the reason that Mike Novogratz, Eric Schmidt, Lary Sanger, and Bittfinex found EOS so early. 

So yeah, in conclusion. Brock Pierce is incredibly sharp, but like many people with a laser focus in one area it's likely he can be incredibly naive in others. There is no evidence that he ever acted out of malice or actively tried to harm other teens back when he worked for Digital Entertainment Network. 

I get that he's a kooky guy with what some might consider to be naive beliefs. But don't underestimate him. Don't forget that this was the guy that, came up with a precursor to youtube as a teen, realized he could monetize World of Warcraft, and got Goldman Sachs to give him the money to do it, launched the first ICO, co created tether, and has been deeply involved in bitcoin for almost 7 years.

2384,"Eos was designed as a compromise. If you go for radical decentralization it is too easy to take control of the network because consensus node's do not have to prove that they are not from the same group or entity. So one group or entity can just spin up as many of these permissionless nodes as possible. If you go with a totally permissioned system, that is complete centralization, because you need permission from some authority and that authority is by default centralized. EOS exists in a middle area where 21 nodes have permission from a crowd of investors. So the crowd=decentralization and 21 nodes = permission. So it's a fusion of these concepts. Either extreme seems to lead to centralization, and if there is such a thing as decentralization it probably must exist between the two extremes.",18-09-30-22-14,2,564,eosview,9k5xbm

Conclusion read below:
""I don’t think there will be a fork""

.......................................

""Daniel Larimer:
Who here would prefer a benevolent centralized but publicly auditabe chain that community could fork if bad things happen

Competition among public centralized chains with ibc may resolve all politics

Old Man:
If it were run by B1 I think a lot of folks would be on board

Joe:
I propose that exchange accounts should not be allowed to vote. I propose that this rule gets written into the constitution.

Daniel Larimer:
Define exchange

Why not

So much hate of those with infunce earned by market

Old Man:
Token custodian

Joe:
an exchange account is an EOS account that originally sourced from the original ERC20 ETH account and any account created from that account

Daniel Larimer:
Ban proxies too

John Chamberlain:
This would kinda resemble excluding from an airdrop 🤔

Old Man:
Can't prove who an exchange user votes for

Simone Ruggeri:
Most people here agrees with Dan.

This happens because, is the fact we agree with Dan that lead us to have interest in EOS.

If we trusted the existing ""system"" we wouldn't invest our efforts to build a new one.

Decentralization is needed because centralization can't lead to true respect of life liberty and property.

Daniel Larimer:
Decentralization is means to end. Free market competition is true decentralization

Imagine we had 21 chains operated by 1 producer each.


Daniel Larimer:
Technically is can be more reliable, legally it can be in many jurisdictions and be cloned to new producer if problem occurs

Likely outcome is Pepsi and coke

Trying to force everyone into one chain is going to waste everyone’s time arguing over fundamental difference in values.  Launching a code is law chain may capture value for token holders that is currently lost to eth and etc

Michael:
I wouldn't prefer this outcome, as it limits small players from competing. However it's still possible/likely we end up with 2-3 dominant blockchains 10 years from now.

Daniel Larimer:
Pareto always in effect

Aneta:
Are you proposing that unhappy people should just fork off?

Daniel Larimer:
I’m saying we shouldn’t try to push our wills on eachothrt

That if a position has market value then it can and should be created

Let speculation decide outcome

Michael:
A fork of EOS without governance would not surprise me, and might be a good thing, see which one does better

Daniel Larimer:
Hedge.

They can peacefully coexist

Only competition can drive improved outcome

Because a house divided against itself cannot stand

Michael:
I mean if an EOS with no gov forked off, the price would quickly reflect the market sentiment

Daniel Larimer:
If everyone got airdrop then they can ride both sides

Lisa Chandler:
Would instantaneous confirmation of a transaction help to prevent hacking?

Daniel Larimer:
No

Eos should remain the current one with governed arb

HeadiEddie:
I actually like the idea of a few chains that are not in true competition, but in collaboration to experiment with many approaches....What bitcoin should have done. Civility and study.

Daniel Larimer:
All tools and explores would work fir all

Anna | EOS Tribe (eosTribe.io):
Respectively, before your net worth of 600 - 700 million dollars, did you not feel the same way?

Daniel Larimer:
I actively desired people of that worth to take a stand and do something. Always wondered why they didn’t fix things

Aneta:
Could same BPs operate on more chains?

Daniel Larimer:
Yes

Steve Floyd - eostribe.io:
Unless those other chains make rules that exchanges and certain mining pools are banned.

Daniel Larimer:
I think people don’t understand how market cap and connections to influencers are related.

HeadiEddie:
I'm wondering how to pull it off with one token..

Daniel Larimer:
Bite the hand that feeds you so to speak

I don’t think there will be a fork.

Too much work not enough interest""",18-06-24-05-57,11,647,Crypto_crow,8tchu7
2407,"Yeah, he really said this. EOSIO software is open source and anybody can launch their own chains.

The discussion was inspired by people who don't like how the mainchain is run. They are demanding changes which are opposite of what EOS is designed to be.

Dan supports free markets and competition, so he has nothing against people launching blockchains based on EOSIO software with different governance models.

Those who don't like what EOS is, should stop complaining and create better chain with their own rules. It would be great for all if there were several chains so that people with different opinions could focus on building a community they think it's the best.

Different EOSIO-based chains can peacefully coexist. If there was a ""code is law"" chain that would take away users from Ethereum to EOSIO ecosystem and make us all stronger. Because of inter-blockchain communication all these chains could live in the same ecosystem.

My personal advice for anybody considering a new chain is not to call it ""EOS"". We have already the mainchain and it's not going to go anywhere. Calling your chain EOS-something is just deceiving users, so please pick distinctive name. We want peaceful coexistence, so let's avoid fighting like BTC/BCH folks.",18-06-24-05-57,11,152,Samupaha,8tchu7

2431,"It's your perception I think.

Being critical of systems and having differing opinions is one thing, and can sometimes drive to a more optimal result. However, when you have two completely different opinions about the fundamentals of how a system should work, there isn't really a way of reconciling them when they think the principles of the opposing viewpoint are destined for failure.

For example, you have one group who thinks that some level of human governance should be present to oversee cases where ""code is law"" might fail and cause issues. The other group thinks that code, even when flawed, should be the final say because there is no trust in humans required. There is no level of compromise here which would be beneficial to either side, but both sides *can* have a chain which fits their own view of governance.

2513,"Although UBI may sound like a socialist/communism dream or whatever, I’d say this is a pretty poor way to relate all the concepts included: UBI, socialism, communism and even “dream”. Arguably the concepts of socialism and communism are so infected that I think its better to throw them away entirely when talking about the world. “Sounds like a socialist/communist dream” doesn’t really say anything meaningful to me.

Saying “there is no such thing” may sound cool, but is a faulty way of thinking if your goal is to accurately define reality. If you want to prove a concept, you can point at one example which is this way. However, if you want to disprove a concept, you have to point at every example and show that none of them are this way, which is next to impossible. This is why it’s almost never done this way in science.

In what way is the monetary economy “adding value to the public’s life”? If you talk about mental and physical health, most of human history was without money where human beings were happier and healthier than today. You have to understand that every system creates a semantic sphere where the system itself is implicitly upheld as “higher” or “better” than the alternatives. If wealth under the current system was the inevitable result of hard work and enterprise, most woman in Africa would be millionaires.

If there are no rewards for sitting on your ass, how come passive ownership is rewarded higher than work? The mindless answer to this is that the current system rewards work at some point, but this answer is a poor work-around which hasn’t actually addressed the original question, as current systems have unsustainable proportions of rewards.

Now, what I’m trying to help you with here is to drive the discussion away from polarised “socialist” and “capitalist” points, which really have less of a place than they are credited for when it comes to a discussion of UBI (or really most other concepts in the world).

I feel like everyone complaining on here has no-idea what ""open source / free software"" even means. Eosio is open source software for creating blockchains, and WAX is using it to, surprise surprise, CREATE THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAIN. Which is the exact purpose that eosio was developed for! Yes they are going to modify it, their allow to do whatever they want to it, we all are allowed to do whatever we want with it to, hence ""open source"". The main feature of eosio is that it enables inter-blockchain communication, so that everyone can make a blockchain and all those blockchains can talk to each other. Guys expect to have multiple eos chains, thats the whole point! When one chain fills up, you just make another and they communicate together. That is how horizontal scaling (parallel processing) works, and that is how eosio achieves its high throughput performance. This is great news. Wax says block.one is going to help them along, which shows that block.one is helping devs get up and running before they even officially launch. It's not really a fork, this is analogus to buying a car or pc and customizing it by switching parts out. Another example is how video games do this all the time with cryengine and unreal. Don't give WAX any flack, hell they choose eos over ARK, LISK, Tendermint, ect, you should be happy. Whether or not the WAX blockchain talks to other blockchains is up to them, but eosio software has this feature built-in. Eosio could potentially even let private blockchains and public blockchains talk to each other. This is the real deal guys. Upvote this so people can take there heads out of there ass.

Block.one is developing a working blockchain... that's what we're discussing. What you're conflating this with is that Block.one isn't launching the genesis block of this blockchain. 

And yes, Block.One is writing a constitution. It's being written by Thomas Cox currently. The articles are presented individually and you can view them here  https://forums.eosgo.io/categories/eos-governance-economics-philosophy

Regardless, we're talking about main net. Whether it be block.ones baby or not, that's determined by consensus. I can tell you one thing. I'll bet ya it won't be the WAX constitution that is implemented for the main chain base layer governance. And guess what? That means WAX isn't going to be capable of cross chain communication with the eos main net. 

Soo... Why would this community want a non compliant chain to be involved in our discussions? And why would we want to support their ability to post here, given that they contribute nothing back to the eco system.

There are all kinds of great models we could think about on a free market basis to aid development in Latin America.

For example: peer to peer micro lending with EOS. Or, peer to peer marketplaces for everything from dried fruit and coffee to artesanias or clothing. 

I put some thought into a stable medium of exchange idea. I just don’t see how it could be practical from a top-down direction. For the reasons listed above, the direct EOS airdrop isn’t going to happen.

Option 2 would be a token on the EOS platform that had some kind of stable, pegged value. The outside world would have to give that token the value. For example, medicine entering from Florida could be purchased with this token, and the token could be distributed to each family or individual. 

Option 3 would be to figure out what the Venezuelan people are able to produce that would be of value to the outside world, and buy it from them with EOS or an EOS based token. Perhaps there could be dApp where foreign visitors could pay for their visit to Venezuela with EOS or an EOS token.

I don’t know. None of these seem like great ideas. Real solutions tend to come from the ground up, from the root of the problem. 

I spent awhile in Colombia during the late Chavez years, and heard stories from travelers who had just crossed the border. They told me that private farming had been destroyed by the subsidization of the state run markets, not by forceful restriction of the private market. The state crushed the free market farmers through a form of charity. This is a common problem.

Unless there is a way to know how much EOS you need to run a certain dAPP and unless this amount decreases over time, I do not think that EOS will give the gains that BTC and Ethereum did. The point of the project is to get many people involved and to run their business on EOS. Therefore, the price will rise, but then it will stagnate. I also believe that, in a long run, EOS will fuck-up the same way the FaceBook did (perhaps by manipulating the price of EOS, and letting the big investors have a monopoly over the small startups... this his how votes will mean nothing at all) ... This is only my opinion, based on nothing but the complaints that EOS is compromising decentralization for a speed. Until then, I want to try to open several projects... to learn as much as I can, and open several EOS tokens of my own, earn the money I need for a financial independence, not from EOS but with those tokens.  I have pretty much lost all the hope there is for making enough money to quit a daily job (in order to work on dApps) with EOS, given this shitty first quarter.  I was expecting EOS to be $50 now, not $5. The biggest fuck-up EOS made so far is selling itself to exchanges and creating the cup-like pattern with the BTC. I simply think that it was artificially created by a careful manipulation. Also the fact that Dan avoids to talk about the price is a big red flag for me... Money is important, dApps are important, technology is important.  I am in fro all of those reasons!  unfortunately, I got in at the bad time, and given the crappy market, can't get out. Therefore my pessimistic opinion is that the price will stagnate, the market will be manipulative price-wise, strong hands will be protected and weaker ones will be purged and taken the advantage of...  I just hope I am wrong!

2712,"Well, technichally, it will be at set at 5%. That 5% is then put into different ""buckets"" and the BPs choose which buckets they go into. 1-2% for the BPs alone is fairly reasonable, but there will be multiple""buckets for multiple things. Thomas Cox explains that in this video: https://youtu.be/XhaXbK92BTE. BPs will be able to burn tokens in certain ""buckets"" thereby reducing the inflation rate. But I doubt it would be down to 1 or 2% because of how many different things it's used for. 


But, I'll oblige and re-run the numbers in a scenario where the token price takes off, and the inflation is just 1%.
I'll start with EOS being at $500 -- and I have 1,000 EOS. After year one, to continue to hold
 .0001% of the network, I'd need to buy 10 more EOS during that year. Again, that is still an annual cost of $5,000. If the inflation is 2% that's $10,000 for my first year. And it only goes up exponentially from there. 

If I run this scenario with the price of being $1,000 at 2% inflation, first year annual costs come to $20,000. 

That may be fine! But I haven't seen this discussed anywhere else and it's really important that the token holders can make enough through token rental to stay involved in the community. If we lose voting power and network resources every single year it won't be long until that 1,000 EOS is worth what 1 EOS is worth in June of this year. (I don't mean necessarily in dollar terms -- I mean in usability on the network).  ",18-04-02-03-17,2,216,gstevv,88sd8w
2713,"Thanks man! Unless I'm missing something really obvious -- I believe my initial percentage was correct. 1,000 EOS is .000001, but because I was talking in percentages that decimal is multiplied by 100. 
.000001 and .0001% are the same amount. 

EDIT: just like 5% can also be written as .05 -- 
.0001% can be expressed as a decimal of the whole as .000001. ",18-04-02-03-17,7,216,gstevv,88sd8w
2714,"My biggest complaint is that these higher market cap coins need their own fiat pairs and not be bound to BTC constantly spiking and taking a dive. I believe it hurts the industry being tied to crypto/crypto pairs.

Also, one thing to keep in mind is market cap and circulation of coins. Example: anyone that thinks Cardano will ever hit $100, or even $50, is crazy. For that to happen they’d have to have such a high % of market share that it’s almost theoretically impossible. They have so many billions of coins out there that $5 might be the cap for ADA.

But with EOS, I don’t expect to make all this ridiculous money because I think there will never be a huge price point that’ll ever be close to what BTC has. I’ll even venture to guess that we might only see 1 more coin ever push 10k and it would have to be one with a solid team and tech with limited shares available. I could see EOS hitting $100 but I doubt we will ever see an EOS share worth $1000.",18-04-02-03-17,2,0,[deleted],88sd8w

Thanks:  Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

La Iniciativa Q es un intento de ex empleados de PayPal para crear un nuevo sistema de pago en lugar de las tarjetas de crédito que se diseñaron en la década de 1950. El sistema utiliza su propia moneda, la Q, y para que las personas comiencen a utilizar el sistema una vez que esté listo, se están asignando Q de forma gratuita a las personas que se inscriban ahora (la cantidad disminuye a medida que se incorporan más personas, así que es mejor inscribirse temprano). Inscribirse es gratis y solamente te pedirán tu nombre y una dirección de correo electrónico. No hay nada que perder, pero si este sistema de pago se convierte en un método de pago líder en el mundo, tus Q pueden valer mucho. Si te perdiste la oportunidad de obtener bitcoin hace siete años, no te querrás perder esto.

many have accused EOS of market manipulation and to be honest, i'm more inclined to assume that to be true than the other way around, given everything on the table (and Bayesian priors).

downvoting stuff into oblivion really doesn't help anybody's situation either, by the way.

neither does it save reputations.

regardless of what project or platform we're talking about, i would really like to see some more maturity in this space. again, the reactions here don't seem indicative of that unfortunately.

Nick Szabo , Emin Gun and many others of his caliber (both more competent and less ethically questionable than that egomaniac Daniel Larimer who doesn't seem to particular care about anything else but lining his own pockets... I also keep track of and am documenting his lies everywhere I see them - I'll post them when the time comes too) have expressed a lot of valid criticism when it comes to EOS, none of which have been addressed.

and seriously man, speculating on network resource instead of getting your shit together is really embarrassing.

not here to push buttons, deliberately annoy anybody or any such thing, but was hoping to see at least some meaningful answers and responses. again, downvoting stuff doesn't help it. and if it so happens that EOS and Daniel Larimer dump their bags on you, having in the end used you (Larimer doesn't see you as anything other but ""useful idiots"", about that at least I can assure you), you might reconsider a lot of things and regret for not demanding that [block.one](https://block.one) and Larimer be more accountable.

but hey, it's your money and your ethics on the line, not mine, so... you're free to justify anything any way you like. it just puzzles me sometimes how people are inclined to read and see what they want. facts nonetheless always prevail over wishful thinking (or Dan's promises of bending the laws of physics and ""running Ethereum on a single EOS smart contract"" while rushing in to seek Vitalik's support and endorsement when he's embarrassed himself to the point of having become the laughing stock of basicaly everybody is just... i don't know what to say any more...)

fact is, nobody really has anything but partial understanding about the matters (of distributed systems, decentralization, crypto-economics, etc etc... being so mixed discipline and highly experimental field), and some of those who have SOME understanding exploit it to profit from people's gullibility, ignorance and sometimes lower instincts. Larimer is doing exactly this for a second time now. and seems very good at getting away with it.",18-07-13-18-33,1,1343,rhyzom,8yi9c6

If you have a situation where for some reason entering the competition is prohibitive due to costs/laws/space it is then ripe for price gauging. Roads are an excellent example of that - the space for them is limited and providing alternatives while possible can be very costly, especially in an urban setting. So if you go for privately owned roads you can expect companies to optimize their profits by raising prices as much as they can.

Ethereum Foundation did the DAO fork and reverted transactions, yet these people are screaming the loudest about EOS, and they have the guts to claim that ""code is law"", ""build unstoppable applications"", etc. Yet when Parity screwed up, they thought oh ok, let's just do nothing about it. First they do one thing, then they do another thing, because why? well just because some guys in charge think so, there was no clear consensus within the community on either of the two events.

The people that are now behind Bitcoin Cash almost 51% attacked the original BTC chain (Segwit2x). It only never happened because they cancelled it themselves.

Blockchains can't stop the fight for power. EOS at least formalizes it and makes it clear, which is why I like it.

There are other advantages to dApps which I think are not yet explored. For example crypto payments will be way easier on EOS than with credit cards. This will also enable the creation of social networks from which users can extract value rather than the company can extract value from users (e.g. something like Steemit vs something like Facebook).

Anyway, when I think about what kind of dApps can be built on say Ethereum, I'm hard pressed to find legit use cases anyway. Bitcoin makes sense because you need censorship resistance for storing/moving significant sums, you don't need censorship resistance to buy your coffee. What would you build on Ethereum? None of these webapps are going to work on ETH anyway with half a minute request times and micropayments for each thing you do.

Realistically though, those decisions always come with a cost. It will make things more difficult to use, both in terms of usability and resources. A completely decentralized network will never be able to scale to the point of being able to run enterprise type applications because there simply won't be enough resources available to make it happen. The only real question then is at what point you're willing to make that compromise. Some choose to use pools, headed up by individuals wealthy enough to make substantial hardware investments, and say that is the line of centralization (despite there being a barrier to entry for the average person).

EOS says that's not going far enough to allow for some of the intended applications, and instead substitutes fewer BPs while providing those that don't invest in expensive hardware a say in it's direction to offset the smaller number of producers.

Other hacks will be people that keep too much on hot wallets like Blockchain.info or mobile wallets with weak passwords and no 2 factor authentication. 

There are new exchange designs coming that should allow a very high level of security which will be based around ledgers and actually not give the exchanges full control of people funds without them signing a transcraction from their ledger. Check legloas exchange which will be coming soon with a similar kind of system. 

Once upon a time people didn't understand how to connect a PC together, or send an email. Especially in the early days you had to know command line code to send a simple message on the internet. Developers built easier tools on top of the internet to make it easier for non techy people. I imagine one day ledger tech will be inside a mobile phone with finger print access and it will be very easy with maybe even the seed word on a little metal plate you get when you buy the phone. There are so many things that can be done to make bitcoin easier to use. Maybe some will prefer a bank or something like a bank to look after their bitcoin and make it very easy for them to use and impossible for them to make a mistake, but some others won't because they won't trust the bank. At least the choice is there for those that want it. 

Maybe some strange kind of service will come available that shows you how to use it and creates a multi Sig system with them so you have to authorise transactions with them that you have to sign but so do they. This way you can't move the money if someone is trying to force you and they can't move the money without you. There is an endless amount of possibilities we can dream of with programable money.

I've been looking into writing a dapp on EOS myself. Part of the reasoning is a C++ base rather than being forced into higher level scripting languages (which means better performance when written well), and because I would have more of a say in the operation of the network there than on something like Ethereum.

They are two different approaches to a similar problem. To be completely realistic about it, we won't have proper comparisons until we see large scale applications benchmarked across both.

what you are doing is not even considered ""statistical"" let alone being scientific approach. you took graphs only as a way of measurement, ignoring/forgetting/hiding other facts in all the past history

ETFs will be available, custody solutions will be in place, and institutional investors will have stopped playing ""musical chairs"" and start to sit down, driving the price up during a fomo rush magnitudes of order more intense than anything we've seen thus far.

I think your EOS prediction is a bit low.  If one uses today's % price versus BTC and then adjust a bit upwards for additional fomo due to enterprise dApp adoption, plus user fomo, EOS will be a bit higher.  Your EOS price timeframe coincides with enterprise dApp rollout and adoption beginning late 2019 and increasing dramatically 2020 onward. 👍

Your ETH price prediction is WAY too high.  dApps are going to continue to move to, or launch on, EOS.  ETH may not die out completely, but the opportunity costs and cost benefits are not working in ETH's favor.  I think ETH will struggle to peak beyond $2,000.

This is what I think of XRP:

To be very blunt: I don't consider XRP a cryptocurrency. My reasoning: it is regulated. It is controlled by centralized powers which can shut it down or seize user funds. Case in point: Ripple was fined $700,000 in 2015.

You cannot fine a true decentralized blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, as they have no central point of control. To me Ripple is no better than any other banking-centralized platform.

The goal of crypto is monetary sovereignty and to help people escape the abuse of fiat that existing centralized systems impose. Ripple doesn't help any of these things.

Maybe Ripple will help there be faster, cheaper payment rails, but it does not forward mankind's freedom much (if at all), and it is not a cryptocurrency.

Ripple investment opinion: On a personal level, I don't invest in projects that I don't believe in fundamentally. There is a rule of thumb I go by, which is: for something to be truly innovative, it must be at least an order of magnitude better than the incumbent system it is replacing.

It is entirely possible Ripple will continue to see growth as it did in 2017. It saw some huge gains. I think again this is due to the fact that it does improve upon the legacy systems in terms of speed and cost. It may become an effective SWIFT replacement. It just doesn't go beyond that, and doesn't touch upon the things that brought me into the cryptocurrency space, which is monetary sovereignty for ordinary people, and freedom from economic suppression. Ripple doesn't solve those kind of problems.

Time will tell which cryptocurrencies will be the biggest gainers. If Ripple gains, it will be because it is useful as a legacy system replacement, not because it betters the world.

I think again this is due to the fact that it does improve upon the legacy systems in terms of speed and cost. It may become an effective SWIFT replacement. It just doesn't go beyond that, and doesn't touch upon the things that brought me into the cryptocurrency space, which is monetary sovereignty for ordinary people, and freedom from economic suppression. Ripple doesn't solve those kind of problems.

Time will tell which cryptocurrencies will be the biggest gainers. If Ripple gains, it will be because it is useful as a legacy system replacement, not because it betters the world.

Mention a Nano and private keys and 2fa just to start and they are gone. And I am talking about people who are successful in business. They haven't been on Reddit for 4 years talking crypto. Then they go out and do something daft like creating a Coinbase account. Compare the security process in crypto to an account I opened at a major Canadian bank last week. They prefaced the password creation by saying 'password can only be 6 characters and can only be numbers or lower case letters.' I spit out laughing. This is the world the noobs are coming from.

>The essence of Bitcoin is the ability to operate in a decentralized way, without having to trust **anyone**.  The essence of Bitcoin is to be able to use software to authoritatively, independently, without appeal to authority, verify everything yourself.  You don't trust the other nodes you're talking to.  You assume they're lying.  You don't trust the miners.  You don't trust the people creating the transactions.  You don't trust anything other than the outcome of your own verification and validation.  And through that you end up trusting in something more important: the network effect.

>Bitcoin introduced the concept of decentralized security through computation.  And this has not yet sunk in.  What Bitcoin does, is it allows you to replace a security model that is based around concentric circles of access and control with an institution in the center, with a security model that is inside out, open and accessible to everyone.  A security model that is based on market forces and game theory.  It is the first market-based security model.  Where a series of incentives and punishments ensure that the ultimate result is that you can trust the platform itself as a neutral arbiter that is not controlled by anyone.  Without third parties.  Without intermediaries.  Bitcoin revolutionizes trust.

But while preparing the report based on the data that I had, their randomizer is perfect, and it has a uniform distribution between 1 and 100.

3897,"  With few exceptions most coins were worth substantially more in early January than they are today. Hype and massive amounts of new money entering the market caused this, not adoption, not mainnets.

So, OP congratulations on creating yet another shitpost  regarding price about eos within a month of its mainnet going live and attempting to correlate that to it’s price at the beginning of the year when every crypto asset was in a massive bull run. 

   Maybe you don’t understand that price isn’t a function of current performance. As in maybe you didn’t know that most crypto assets don’t even have a mainnet and have hundreds of millions or even billions in marketcap. Most of the market is just traders manipulating the price in any way possible trying to figure out where the next hype new crypto trend or coin will emerge next. 

  Bitcoin , ethereum, eos are all amazing projects in their own respective ways and are all still relatively VERY new. Give them time to mature and gain some real adoption and we can expect to not only enjoy the new technology that they bring to the world,  but profits for those who did invest relatively early on in them. 

  Stop with insane tribalism of propping up only your own investments and bashing others and try to focus on some of the positive aspects of the newer projects and what they could bring to the world.

Best thing to do is not worry about market price and close to the time ensure all your tokens are off-exchange in a registered wallet. That way you can ensure you get EOS mainnet, any competing chains (evolution), everipedia airdrop and any other 'genesis block' snapshot airdrops e.g. chaince/scatter.

It’s simple just register your eos erc20 tokens and you’ll get eos main net tokens in June. Just relax and be patient. Here’s the video: https://youtu.be/3mgRCta3K1k make sure to subscribe to this channel and watch YouTube for many eos videos. As it gets closer to Mainet I’m sure more info will be released for all.

The EOS token(ERC-20 token) is a placeholder for the EOS coins and you will receive it when the EOS main net is released. You need to register your wallet address with your EOS address so you receive the coins.

For US citizens I suggest you sell your EOS tokens now and get in on EOS once their platform is released.

The EOS main net will be released 1st June 2018 and it will be the community's responsibility to release the EOS platform.

4066,"Vlad Zamfir discusses the trade offs on twitter pretty in depth with some other PoS / dPoS advocates. Throughput / Overhead / Security / Fees. There’s a trade off between them and no one system does all well. 

EOS’s masternodes are a tradeoff for significant increases in throughput / reduction of overhead at the potential cost of security via lesser degree of decentralization.

PoW based blockchains trade the throughput and greater overhead for what was SUPPOSED to be increased security until ASICs and ASIC boost came around. A little less of an issue for non-ASIC mineable blockchains, but cost of electricity and equipment will always result in miner centralization to areas where it is < than others (e.g. China). 


dBFT in NEO has similar trade offs with the current negative being mostly centralization of the bookkeeping nodes. I don’t like consensus mechanisms that go out of their way to prevent forks. That seems disingenuous since forking is a natural function of the consensus mechanism to ensure freedom of choice in blockchain development / direction and the community’s right as members of the consensus triad. If you try to fork NEO if you’re an elected bookkeeper node, but don’t get 2/3 consensus, you’re penalized heavily via loss of bookkeeper status, which means you can pretty much kiss your economic incentive to be a validator goodbye. Treating any fork as a potential attack is not very community friendly. Onchain pretty much controls bookkeeping nodes currently, and I highly doubt they’ll ever seek to actually redistribute that power. Given their ties with the Chinese govt, I would expect them to remain in total control of it to appease regulators.

Edit: Also one thing Ethereum does better is it has a production blockchain. Meanwhile EOS community is still waiting on Dawn, which is fine, patience is a virtue for new tech, but Ethereum is first to market in the stateful feature, SC enabled blockchain realm, which will be hard to unseat, especially if the switch to Casper PoS is successful in 2018.

You may want to look up the word ""Arbitrage"". If the crowdsale EOS price was any lower than the exchange price at the end of a period, users would buy from the crowdsale and then resell for small profits on an exchange. If the crowdsale price was higher, the inverse would happen. For this reason there is plenty of reason for Block.one to prop up the crowdsale price, especially with how much stake they have in EOS. Better yet, you can just tell investors that you are going to complete an audit after the crowdsale and then just never do it.

Just because an exchange invested in EOS doesn't mean they investigated it completely. If there was an audit, why has no one publicly seen it?

It DOES matter, people invested in a project and were promised an audit after the crowdsale ended. Then all we got was silence. I just want answers. Cold hard facts. Not this ""We should just assume that they had our best interests in mind"" BS.

4193,"Hey guys! A lot of you here are probably already familiar with me, if not, my name is

Ezra Yao and I make EOS videos at [www.youtube.com/clamantfever](https://www.youtube.com/clamantfever).

&#x200B;

After I made a video tutorial about EOSBet Dice, I unexpectedly made 210 EOS Tokens which

adds up to over $1300 USD. Not by playing the game, but through referrals. 

So I decided to make a video showing exactly how I did it and how you can too.

&#x200B;

To sum it up, all you have to do is make an account and get your referral link. Then send

it out to as many people as possible. Use telegram, facebook, youtube, whatever your

preferred method is. Also I'd encourage you to even introduce you to your non-crypto friends and family,

as this is one of the first successful use cases for blockchain outside of speculation.

This will drive up adoption, awareness, and eventually the price of EOS as well, it's a win-win-win for  

all of us.

&#x200B;

Anyways, the main point I want to highlight here is, this is the beauty of the EOS blockchain. 

With centralized services such as Amazon, this was never possible. The Amazon referral system gives you

a one time, 20% bonus. And while that seems like a lot, over time the EOS referal system adds up to being much more 

because you don't have to constantly worry about finding new customers or selling to new people.

&#x200B;

Best of all, this once and for all shuts down the stupid centralization argument from ETH supporters.

Time and time again we have shown we are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than ETH or BTC. 

But the FUDsters at /r/cryptocurrency just repeat the same ""OMG BUT EOS IS CENTRALIZED, WHY NOT JUST USE CENTRALIZED SERVICES LIKE AMAZON THEN???""

narrative. Now we have officially shown we can even do something Amazon cannot. Amazon couldn't offer micro-transactions because the fees would cost more than the 0.5% bonus.

BTC and ETH are far too slow not to mention too expensive. And this is exactly why you would use EOS over centralized services. 

We can do things that neither centralized services like Amazon, nor other cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH can do, and we are just a short 3 months removed from our mainnet launch.

The future looks bright my friends!!!

If EOS works, is fast and is free... will the average  person carrying a credit card in their wallet care if it’s “truly decentralized”.

I’m kinda thinking the average person that has no tech savvy whatsoever beyond how to access Facebook on their iPhone... won’t really care if something is centralized at all.

What I took from this article is the following. ETH network is mostly light-clients and should not be counted as ""validators"". Number of full sync nodes if very small and run by few pools (as Dan has been saying for years).

I see so many people saying ... ohh Vitalik is smart he will figure out... well.. Einstein was smart and he failed to solve some of the most crucial equations. That is not an argument.

But compared to ETH which hides behind light-clients and counts them as ""validators"" EOS is open in its design. Dan Larimer realized the only way forward is combination of more centralization (higher throughput) and governance models. Compared to ETH, EOS BPs will never run into situation that they can't sync with the network because the ledger size is so high only data centers can process them.

There is a point where we have to ask ""How much decentralization is enough"" ? Dan clearly answered this question many times by saying current EOS design of 21 +100 nodes is more then enough. If one BP is under attack it can be replaced by standby node in 45 sec. Good luck attacking all 121 (or only 51% of them), that is almost impossible task (from what I saw recently many EOS BP candidates showed that those data centers have strong DDoS protection).

EOS sinks like the Titianic?  I noticed whenever someone asks him or that greedy Hebrew he's partnered up with questions, instead of answering questions directly, they avoid answering like politicians and instead blow smoke up the questioner's ass by answering in metaphors like ""..they are building skyscrapers.."".  More like they are building Titanics.

The Talmud states that it is not necessary to return something to goyim(human cattle) if you rob them.  After robbing the goyim for a whole year with ICOs, you think they would have a clue what they are doing.  They don't.  Cloud space for building applications?! Are you kidding me?!  It's such a bad idea and nobody has guts to tell that egghead to his face it's a bad idea.  The emperor's new clothes fit good on Larimer.  Why do I want to build applications on Larimer's shit when I have a computer at home?!

Building applications from scratch on Linux?!  Linux might be a first language to Larimer and his buddies but most people don't have autism.- No windows, apple or any sensible way of compiling programs and he thinks it's going to take off, just because he is an egomaniac that loves complication?!  K.I.S.S. - Keep it simple stupid! Noooope!!!that's not the dorky way of the Jedi.  I've personally done a bit of programming around Y2K which I learned on the job at a chemical plant,nothing too fancy like egghead; I made mainly financial & scheduling apps so shipping, production and the office could work together real time and know what was coming in or out.  We had consultants charge$1000/day and another $300/day when importing a database to a new system that was even worse.  When I figured out what they were doing like a spy, which wasn't much like putting prices back in a database from buggy software, they were quite annoyed with me as they had no reason to come back.  I use both hemispheres of my brain whereas most dorks with their obsession with doing things the hard way, only use half.

Egghead, Talmud Hebrew boy & Co. are tricksters - Ravens & Coyotes Ltd.  EOS is run by greedy dorks with no leadership skills.  When the S.S. EOS finally sinks where are they going to hide?!  Larimer better sell his Bitcoin and buy an Island.  Along with Blumer.

What was Hack-a-thon all about but a way for Larimer to find more autistic Linux enthusiasts to sodomize?!

Don't get me started on Larimer's abuse of euphemisms by misnaming ""stakes"" - oh you mean ""THEFT"" , ""FEES"", ""RANSOM"" when you say ""stakes"" don't you egghead?!

Mandatory ransom of EOS coins plus charging people to vote?! What the fuck?! Maybe if they started charging people to vote in the US, they would stop elections?! Oh but egghead doesn't think he is charging people to vote because he is using the word ""Stake"". How benevolent?!

Maybe EOS needs a flag to go with their constitution and ""stake""holders can pledge allegiance to Lucifer and put a big eyeball on it as the original US flag once had?! Come to think of it, EOS goddess has some connection to the Dawn(Lucifer) doesn't it?!

Is Larimer the reincarnation of George Washington or something?!

""Decentralize Everything""!?  Give me a fucking break.  EOS is so centralized by Larimer's insane laws and bylaws and crypto-laws.

Oh, but I can use my ""stake"" to vote, what a fucking privilege!?.  WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I CARE WHAT FORTUNE 500 ISRAELI COMPANY IS GOING TO GET TO MINE EOS, ESPECIALLY SINCE I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MINE IT?!

They're more like the Texas Instruments of crypto. I think people vastly overestimate Ethereum's capability simply because viable competition until now has been scarce to none. A true competitor to Eos will arise some day, but its not ETH; at least not in its current form. EOS is really building a universe from the ground up; one that up until now has essentially not existed before. For that reason, I really dislike the term ""Ethereum killer"" that has been applied to EOS. I think that's unfair to both ETH and EOS, as they really are just in two different realms in terms of performance and application. 

ETH is currently scrambling to try to implement changes to compete (decreasing/obfuscating fees, hybrid pos integration, and even experimenting with sharding), but it doesn't matter how many super chargers you drop into a Chevy big block 427; it's just not going to outperform a formula one car. They were designed around totally different technology, and seeing them perform a race against each other would just be embarrassing for both drivers.

Depends on the definition of ""centralized"". One might claim, other cryptos are far more centralized by pools. People trusting in the ecosystem relying on trustworthy and serious BPs. If there is malicious action by a BP for whatever reason, people have a natural interest in clearing that out. Still I agree, that we need to find a proper definition of what malicious or mischievously mean.

4660,"Not entirely convinced it has been allowed to resolve itself. 

I suspect the BP's who were complaining about the high RAM price might be manipulating the market by selling large chunks of RAM at key moments i.e the start of a wave. 

This is the only thing that makes sense to me because if everyone who was speculating RAM just bought and held until at least 90% of RAM had been purchased, every single speculator would have made more money. 

This is because it's not like a normal trading platform, speculators are buying RAM against a predictable algorithm. Bancor. It made no sense for anyone to sell which is why I suspect market manipulation is at play.

I think your average whale would be fully aware of this truth and if left without manipulation, the market would have just grown and grown and grown. It happened for the first 3 days as people realised there was logic in selling or even buying the dips because the dips were small and short.

Just 24 hours after Dan had explained why the market should be left as it is, going against certain moaning BP's who wanted to bring the price down by increasing the RAM capacity conveniently large dumps started to happen at key moments. This brought the price crashing down as speculators saw these dumps. Since then, these unknown whales have kept the price down. I believe this manipulation is being done until more RAM is added.

However, a few days after this manipulation has ended, the same will happen again. The speculators will realise there is no need to sell and the price will moon again. This time it will likely level itself off in the early 90% where speculators will sell before a new chain is created and their profits are lost.",18-07-06-02-06,2,436,rreeve,8wbn88

I agree, its unsustainable on its own but RAM trading is just a small cog within the EOS eco-system. I imagine this may be by design as Dan was encouraging more RAM speculation.

Maybe this is designed to force the staking of EOS tokens so they become a scarce asset which then supports the planned token leasing marketplace. 

There could be other reasons I haven't considered but EOS should be viewed as a whole eco-system. When you view individual parts of the environment on its own, you don't get the bigger picture.

This is where Dan's experience is invaluable. EOS is a mash-up of Steem, Bitshares and new ideas to create an environment that Dan has wanted so he can build his applications. The idea of EOS is a platform perfectly suited for blockchain developers like Dan.

I'm slowing getting my head around EOS but it can be hard to fully understand, especially in this early stage where every cog hasn't been implemented yet.

I know they want EOS to be viewed as online real estate. (The online equivalent of real-world homeowners are developers) For this they need to create token scarcity to increase the value of EOS.

4689,"The article is well-written and sure, it lays out *some* *potential* issues with EOS although, in my opinion, they are unlikely to actually be an issue. To name a few:

/Some BPs colluding to ensure an equitable distribution of tokens via airdrop - through the ongoing election process of BPs, those who have committed the most to EOS and have the most tokens hold the most power in BP election. Electing a BP to airdrop tokens is misaligned with their incentives. It’s just not a realistic scenario

/EOS not being a viable store of value due to 5% inflation to reward BPs - as the author rightly states, sovereign currencies that inflate like the USD have achieved this without any issue for generations. Provided the network continues to attract quality developers to build DApps, demand for tokens will outstrip inflation, and steady demand would ensure SoV status

/The notion that EOS or Block.One somehow deceived us all into thinking this was a frictionless environment that is also costless - EOS and Block.one have always been very upfront on this point that there are costs to running and maintaining a network. Those costs are supported by the inflation that occurs annually

/The idea that if something isn’t completely decentralized, it is therefore centralized (i.e., binary). I disagree, you only have to look at ETH versus BTC versus EOS. After EOS mainnet launch you will see quite quickly that EOS>ETH>BTC in terms of decentralization. BTC and PoW has proven to be an ineffective form of ensuring decentralization. There are shades of grey.

I could go on...

But moreover, and perhaps most frustratingly, the article doesn’t propose any actual solutions to the blockchain trilemma. Just ideas that are under development. They sound great on paper, but until we see it in action, it’s just conceptual.

As far as I’m aware, EOS has never claimed to solve the trilemma either; rather EOS’ approach (i.e., giving up some decentralization (arguably) for scalability) is how they envision blockchain can best provide value to “mainstream” users. It’s their take on tackling this issue, and I for one agree with them.

Finally, I hope we can all agree that no matter which blockchain platform you prefer, they are all better than their truly centralized counterparts. I see no reason that EOS, Ethereum, Bitcoin and many others can’t coexist peacefully. We are all working towards the same goal.

Someone made a comment about a Reddit post.  Everpedia is another example.  What if I wanted to post or edit 10 wiki pages in 2 hours?  I'd likely have be using a wallet with $100s staked.

My staked CPU does cool down after an hour of rest and allow me to play another session, but I can max my CPU again in about 20 repeated bets.  I'll try staking $100 and see if the cool down happens as fast as my play.  I think the formula would be something like: 10 minutes of play makes CPU go from 0->100% and 30 minutes of waiting makes it go from 100%->0%.  That means if I stake 4x my current stake, then I should be able to play 40 minutes non stop and still have CPU near 0%.  I will try it out.  I have about 5 EOS wallets.

I'm a big EOS fan.  I want to actually use the blockchain and not just read about it.  I want to have personal experience maxing RAM, CPU, and Bandwidth using popular Dapps.  I teach blockchains and I want to be able to tell my students what size wallet it takes to use EOS in real world scenarios.  Teaching ETH and BTC is way different than teaching EOS.  Unless I'm using Lightning or some ETH side chain like FunFair, there's no actions I can do on ETH or BTC repeatedly.

It’s not an airdrop when I have to spend money, even if I can win it back, to get your tokens.  You’d do better not calling it an airdrop.  You create confusion and mistrust.  Just be honest and state you decided to give your tokens to users vs. entire community.  No problem with it, just better to be straightforward.  Many people are looking for good dividend tokens.

Though, the community would prefer an airdrop, we can't tell you how to distribute your tokens/project;  You worked hard on you project you decide how you want to spread the wealth.  But please, Professionally and humbly speaking...  ""don't twist the concepts""  Create an ICO if you feel its better.

Otherwise,  if an airdrop is created, the community will definitely makes use of the tokens.  You can also implement a ""return to the house case for the airdrop tokens""  This will make sure that if tokens aren't used within a period of time they can be recovered and not lost for ever since some wont ever use them (Only for the airdropped coins).  There after, whom ever buys the tokens, which will have a price set by the community can decide how to spend or hold their tokens.

EOS RAM is priced in terms of EOS.

So let's say a whale spent 1,000,000 EOS on RAM when RAM was around .75 EOS/KB.  If we assume that was their average price, that means they purchased 1,000,000/.75 = 1,333,333 KB of RAM = around 1.3 GB of RAM.

Now, let's say the price of EOS crashes, regardless of whether that's due to failures in the project or the technology, or FUD/manipulation, whatever.  Let's say EOS is now at $4.25 USD per token.

Link to Dan´s article explaining why they switched to a market-based allocation approach using the Bancor algorithm.

If you read it, their math was done on a 1TB of RAM basis; not at 64 GB. And as a consequence their RAM price expectations were much lower:

""Our math indicates that if 1TB of RAM was allocated on a pro-rata basis to token holders then the cost-per-byte would be $0.018 (assuming $20/token). The reality is that most token-holders don’t actually have an active need to use the RAM they might be entitled to; therefore, we are initially pricing RAM at $0.000018 per byte (assuming $20/token). New accounts require about 4KB of RAM which means they will cost about $0.10. As RAM is reserved the price will automatically increase so that the price approaches infinity before the system runs out of RAM"".

But back to your original point, it has nothing to do with the price of EOS tokens.  Whether EOS tokens go up, go down, or stay the same in price, the only way for an upside-down RAM speculator to get whole in terms of EOS is for the price of RAM to return above the price they originally paid.  And the only way for them to get whole in terms of USD is for some combination of an increase in RAM price (RAM/EOS) and/or an increase in the price of EOS (EOS/USD).

I'll try one more time:

Price of EOS today is $8.20.  100 EOS spent on RAM @ 0.5 EOS/KB = 200 KB of RAM.  The USD cost of that was $820 (100 X $8.20).

Let's say the price of EOS falls to $5.  If RAM is still around 0.5 EOS/KB, and you sell your RAM, you'll get back almost the same amount of EOS you started with (less the transaction fee, which I'm leaving out of the analysis).  So basically, you'd sell your 200 KB of RAM and get back 100 EOS.

Same number of EOS.

5513,"First of all, I wish you all the best with your  investment decision. Given the solid prospect that EOS presents, I think you will be doing alright :) 

I've been a developer myself for 20+ years and, ever since starting investment in crypto last summer, always found dApp platforms most interesting and readily relatable to me (I've worked on not blockchain but certainly large scale, enterprise-grade projects). 

At the moment, various platform cryptos account for the vast majority of my coin selections (EOS being certainly one of the larger stacks amongst them.) 

I feel comfortable not going a maximalist route because I believe that, as well as one or two dominating platforms, quite a few smaller ones will also successfully carve out a niche on their own accord in the ever-expanding dApp development industry. (Well, it appears that EOS may well become one of the dominating platforms, so I'm very pleased about that!)

Also, my initial investment amount was pretty big so I had to be prudent and diversify better (although still heavily focused on platform category). By the way, in terms of technology my favorites have been EOS and IOTA, and as such, I initially invested in both heavily with confidence and already took out my initial investment and will leave the rest to ride the waves for the next few years (as for other coins, I'll certainly take some profit off this year).

As for Ethereum, given its large pool of talented developers, I am almost certain it will be able to step its game up and eventually reinvent itself that matches (or comes close enough to) EOS in scalability, ease of development and security in one way or another. But EOS may establish itself well before Ethereum could strike back, and the goal post may also have shifted further by then.

That shiny metal has been money for thousands of years. Why do you think people buy gold and silver in the first place? Because fiat is a scam and they want wealth and real money for when the dollar implodes. That is the entire point.

Nobody buys gold and silver to get back more worthless dollars. They buy gold and silver for when there is a currency reset, and prices collapse, and then you can pick up a nice home for a measly 2 or 3 ounces of gold or 200 ounces of silver after the gold revaluation. That is the entire point in buying gold in the first place.

When this debt bomb explodes and the dollar crashes you are going to have TRILLIONS upon TRILLIONS of fake money chasing real hard money - gold and silver which are both small markets

That low interest is only propping up your appreciating asset to make it seem like things are growing. A deflationary collapse of ALL asset prices is assured. You can't have interest rates at 0% for almost a decade and not have it end in economic ruin.

Thomas Jefferson said it himself... the visionary and intellectual that he was...

 ""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by INFLATION, then by DEFLATION, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""

I promise you....get some gold and silver. And the thing is you don't even need that much. 15-20k worth of gold and silver and you are light years away of 99% of the population. A days wage for thousands of years and even in America 150-200 years ago was equal to a silver price the size of a dime or roman Denarius. 8k worth of silver will be equal to 20-30 years of days wages when this whole house of cards comes crashing down. 1 silver dime will probably be worth 4-5 days wage.

5657,"Bear with me here...gold and silver are rare earth metals that have both been money for thousands of years. Hence, they NEVER lose their value. 

The dollar value of gold is absolutely irrelevant. Think about it...did gold all of a sudden become valuable when America was born and the dollar was created? Of course not. So why would you be valuing gold in terms of dollars? If the dollar becomes 100% worthless tomorrow and you can't buy anything with it. My gold is unaffected by that.

Why do you think people buy gold in the first place? Because they DISTRUST fake government fiat paper that gets printed into thin air. So you BUY gold because you want money and wealth for when paper dies and/or a currency reset where prices nosedive and gold is revalued much higher. Nobody buys gold to get bback more increasingly worthless dollars. People buy gold because fiat is a scam.

In fact, I own a good amount of gold and silver and I actually HOPE gold goes back down to 300$ per ounce. Because that would mean our govt has decided to become fiscally responsible and the chance of our currency being ruined will be much lower. All the dollar value of gold represents is how unstable, volatile and the lack of store of value the dollar is. If gold goes back down to 300$/oz then prices of goods and services will drop as well, so owning gold I will lose nothing in terms of real purchasing power if gold drops 1,000 dollars in price.

As far as bitcoin goes. Why would I want to store my value in something that drops 50% in 2 months? Bitcoin is the opposite of a store of value. 

100 years ago a gold ounce = 20$ and 20$ was a good weekly salary back then.

Today 20$ barely buys you lunch at a bar. Yet that 1 ounce of gold is worth $1,350 if you sell it at a coin shop....and $1,350 is a good weekly salary just like an ounce of gold equaling 20$ 100 years ago was a good weekly salary.

So your VALUE was stored for 100 years. If you worked for a week 100 years ago, and put it into a gold ounce. 100 years later you can still buy the same amount of goods today as you bought 100 years ago.",18-02-21-04-16,6,219,MichaelAZcats,7yxl3s

5661,"Well, there’s certainly demand for silver, and the price is low right now. But, crypto’s influence on the monetary system is gonna be profound. I guess the way I look at gold and silver is the way Dicken’s called it in Great Expectations, “portable property.” 

The central banks can’t deflate the fiat currency supply every again. There’s too much debt. The only way out is massive inflation and eventually collapse. I guess if you are considering gold as currency and as the unit of account, you could see a collapse of housing against the price of gold, but I have my doubts. 200 years ago gold and silver were the only “portable properties.” Today we’ve got gold, fiat, and crypto. What happens when robots start mining gold under the ocean or we start mining gold off of asteroids? Nothing’s a sure bet, but i like real estate as a potential value producing asset.

5664,"I understand the value of gold nowadays. You didn't need to explain it. I have always seen it as a very good investment and I still prefer it vs fiat. But now cryptocurrencies are coming up. The dollar will collapse like you say. The case with fiat in the past 100 years: Fiat was the currency, gold was the store of value. Crypto can do both. If bitcoin can do what gold does, why will people store in gold? I understand it are precious metals but the value of actually using the 'precious metal' is way above actual use.

Oh and, yes bitcoin drops 50%.. blehbleh. We're at 180 billion tmc or so. Wait till tmc is 5trillion+ The prices will not be this volatile for ever. And in this case I'm talking about bitcoin with the usecase of store of value. It may become a currency AND a store of value. Trillions. No movement.",18-02-21-04-16,1,413,pokerslam556,7yxl3s
5665,Yup its funny how people dont see the volatility of a penny stock.  Bitcoin is very much like an expensive penny stock that you can legally manipulate without fear.  Big fish were supposed to add stability but really seems to be worse off now.,18-02-21-04-16,1,7,campark43,7yxl3s
5666,"Interesting perspective, and you present a valid argument. For those arguing against you: what do you imagine will happen if the dollar collapses? The impact will be global in magnitude, and will cripple all of the major world governments that hold large quantities of US Treasuries, or who rely on American markets to support their GNP. MANY of the citizens of those countries are also likely crypto investors, who will sell their entire interest without blinking because they'll need the money just to survive. Not only that, but domestically, if the dollar crashes, there will be absolute MAYHEM. I'm talking SHTF, dystopian type stuff. Martial law. An abrupt halt to the societal status quo.

5671,"I'm sorry but you need to re-think...gold is NOT an investment. Gold is REAL money. Gold is a currency AND money. Obviously we aren't going to go back to gold being used as a currency, but it is more importantly money to back the currency. Otherwise... the currency is a fraud, just like the dollar is which is being inflated away into oblivion.

You didn't read what I wrote. The Dollar value of gold is irrelevant. Once you trade dollars for gold your value is stored. When people used gold as money/currency 900 years ago there was no dollar! Gold didn't go up or down in terms of dollars, right? Because there was no dollar. So what does it matter what the dollar price of gold is if you have the gold in your hand?

A gold ounce 900 years ago is still a gold ounce today. Nothing changed with that gold ounce. It is stored economic energy. Real estate, bonds, stocks, and cryptos get their value from energy produced in the future and energy production is declining  fast. That gold ounce is valuable because it's value is based on energy produced in the past.

I mean the ironic thing is... half the reason many people are fleeing to cryptos is because the dollar is dying BECAUSE it isn't backed by gold anymore, whether you realize it or not.

And even more ironic is bitcoin is marketed as digital gold... while many crypto people are anti actual REAL gold. It defies logic.",18-02-21-04-16,1,219,MichaelAZcats,7yxl3s
5672,"It's actually worse than that. He doesn't understand what a store of value even is. A store of value doesn't have voltility. Even if bitcoin goes to 1,000,000 dollars and remains stable at that price point it Still isn't a store of value. Because what is a dollar worth when bitcoin is at $1,000,000?

The primary function of money is to measure value for goods exchanged for it. Money is a barometer of value...how does bitcoin measure value? Gold has measured value perfectly for thousands of years and still does. ",18-02-21-04-16,2,219,MichaelAZcats,7yxl3s
5673,"I appreciate you saying that...means you are thinking which nobody does today.

In Venezuela where their currency has collapsed and people are eating their pets... 1 single ounce of silver (last year at least) bought you 3-4 months of food on the black market. And an ounce of gold buys you a home down there.Think about that... and the absolute scam fiat is. The dollar value of silver right now is 16$. 16$ barely buys you a cheeseburger, fries, and a beer at a bar. Yet when the currency dies like in Venezuela, that ONE single ounce of silver buys you 4 months worth of food. Which when you think about it... it makes absolute sense... for hundreds and thousands of years and even in America 150 years ago....a days wage was a silver piece the size of a silver dime or roman denarius. 14 silver dimes equals 1 ounce. So let's say 500 years ago you worked for 2 weeks and saved up 14 silver pieces the size of a dime and didn't spend any of it. You could pretty easily buy about 4 months worth of food with that 14 days worth of days wages. Granted the people in Venezuela who have silver aren't eating caviar... it buys rice, beans, and staples like that. 

So basically prices of everything have been gigantically inflated because of fiat in comparison to real money. Some dumbass providing no real value for society as an insurance agent is on average probably earning 200$ a day... which equals about 13 ounces of silver a day in dollar price. THIRTEEN ounces of silver per day. When people used to make far less than 1% of the equivalent in silver that someone is getting paid in dollars today as an insurance salesman. That's nuts and totally out of whack when compared to economic reality.

But when fiat fails... and if you have even just like 8k worth of silver right now or 400 ounces... you are literally going to have the equivalent  of 20-30 years worth of days wages with that stack. Because as you know a days wage used to be the equivalent of a silver dime..... but TODAY.... there are billions more people on the planet and much less silver available. So in a fiat collapse that silver dime will probably be worth 3-5 days wage. Obviously not saying you'll be paid in actual silver but the new currency will most likely adhere to a sound money standard at least partly. 

As far as what will happen? I think it won't be as crazy as you think it may. I think they will just revalue gold much higher one day to purge the debt. And Americans standard of living will drop big time. But gold and silver holders will be able to buy that bakery, or house, or land for literally pennies on the dollar for what it cost them to buy that silver or gold in the fiat paradigm. There is going to be an enormous deflationary collapse of all asset prices. Thomas Jefferson pointed this out this out and what would happen if a central bank issues currency, and everything he said would happen is happening now. I'll provide the quote at the end.

Trump even mentioned this. YouTube trump gold standard. And there is like a 3 min clip of him talking at the White House and a Chinese reporter asks him about currency manipulation and he hinted about how we need currencies to all be on an even level and he said ""it's coming sooner than you think."" Of course nobody in America knows what this even means. So it didn't get much press.

Also, china, India, Russia and china have been accumulating gold in record tonnage for years now. With their ever increasingly worthless dollar holdings. Which is why I think that comex has been suppressing the price of silver and gold for years now. Probably a backend deal to allow china to buy on the cheap because they know and we know we can't pay them back. 

Chinese citizens own 6k tons worth of gold in their hands collectively. China even told its citizenry to get silver starting in 2009.
In America Americans think silver is a color. And have no clue. Russia just opened its gold vaults to show the world just 3 weeks ago. Americans don't even know what this means for them soon. Not that they would know anyway because our communist media doesn't report it, but most Americans have no concept that gold is money anyway so it probably wouldn't matter even if they did report it. Even conservatives (who claim to be constitutionalists) will say stupid shit like.... ""but you can't eat gold."" No shit you can't eat gold... nobody ever said but you can't eat gold for thousands of years. Everyone knew gold was money for thousands of years to buy things that you need.... like food.... so you could eat. 

This country is brokenand in debt up to its eyeballs for a reason. Because the banks and govt have been on a 100 year anti gold propaganda campaign and it's worked brilliantly. If you went back in time 100 years EVERY single American would know exactly what gold is and its value and would want it. I play poker and use a gold coin as my card holder and maybe 60% of the people have no idea what it is and are shocked to learn it's $1,350. It's actually sad. All our wealth is being confiscated through inflation and nobody realizes it. They just think corporations are hoarding all the money and they don't understand why 8$/hour puts you in poverty yet 60 years ago 8$/hour was great income. 

I don't know if you own any... but I highly encourage you to get some especially if you aren't tight on money. Even a measly 2-3 ounces of gold and 100 ounces of silver will be a life saver in a currency crisis reset

""Gold is money - and everything else is credit."" - JP Morgan (testimony to confess 1913)

""In the absence of a gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value."" - Alan Greenspan (1966.... before he had the levers of power for the statists... and never mentioned this or gold while fed chairmen)

In regards to how gold has “measured value perfectly” how does it do that?  You assign different size pieces of gold to represent how much something is worth, no?  Why can’t we do the same with bitcoin?  ",18-02-21-04-16,1,56,FubarJenkins,7yxl3s
5678,"Read this whole response...

Why am I bringing it up? Because I'm trying to help. You at least seem eager to hear other perspectives but I promise you, if you dismiss it you'll be dismissing it at your own peril. 

Bitcoin might go to a million dollars... but so what? What will that million dollars be worth in today's dollars? The dollar is just about done.

Gold measures value perfectly because it's real money. if you earned a dollar in 1950 that dollar bought you a lot more back then than it does today, right? So why did your purchasing power decrease? Why couldn't you save that dollar under your bed for 60 years and have it buy the same amount of stuff today as it did 60 years ago? You earned it by working back then yet it doesn't buy as much anymore. Because the govt stole your purchasing power.

If you look up a passage from the Bible... this isn't a religious comment.... but there is a passage in there saying how a gold ounce bought you 350 loaves of bread 2,500 years ago. Google that and you'll see it. Well guess what? That same gold coin from 2,500 years ago still buys you just about 350 loaves of bread today. Gold is $1,350/oz... a loaf of bread is about 4 bucks. 4 bucks multiples by 350 is just about $1,350 dollars. So had you worked and earned an ounce of gold 2,500 years ago.... and you were cryogenically frozen for 2,500 years with that gold coin... you could still purchas 350 loaves of bread today just like you could over 2,000 years ago...

In 1964 the last year they had silver in the coins... a silver dime bought you one gallon of gas. If you saved that silver dime that you worked for 55 years ago until today you can still buy that same gallon of gas granted to take it to a coin shop... where you can get about $2.70 for the silver content in that time. Which is the cost of a gallon of gas today. But if you took that silver dime to a gas station today you can only buy 1/27th of a gallon of gas. So what's changed? That gold ounce still buys you 350 loaves of bread today just like it did over 2,000 years ago. But if you take that silver dime to a gas attendant a mere 55 years later after you earned it you can only buy a fraction of the amount of gas you could buy with it 55 years ago.

So what's changed???

The crazy thing is... whether you realize it or not.... you and many other crypto investors are fleeing the dollar because it isn't backed by gold. Nobody wants to stay in dollars.

But a reset is coming. China, India, Russia, have all been buying gold in record tonnage for a decade now. Chinese citizens collectively own 6k tons of gold. Russia just opened their gold vaults to show the world just 3 weeks ago.

The dollar is almost finished and ba currency reset is coming. And it will be a reset where all prices will be measured in gold. There is so many trillions and trillions and trillions fake printed money out there and it will all be chasing the small gold and silver market. And the transfer of wealth will be incredible.

Home prices, stock prices , and everything else will collapse and gold will be revalued much higher. And even just a few ounces of gold will buy you a nice home. Ever hear of the Weimar Republic hyperinflation? Where the bellcap working at a hotel saved up 25 ounces of gold and when they Had hyperinflation he was able to buy an entire city block with just 25k worth of gold. 

I don't think you understand the deflation that is coming. The Dow to gold ratio historically is 4 to 1. Right now it's like 25 to 1. This is going to revert to 1 to 1 very soon. 

You have to VALUE gold in relation to other real assets, of which it is way undervalued. You don't measure it in dollar prices. And silver is even more undervalued than gold is.

For centuries a days wage was a silver piece the size of a silver dime or roman denarius. So if you go out and buy just 8k worth of silver you would literally have 20-30 years worth of days wages when this house of cards comes crashing down. Because a silver dime will probably end up being worth 2-5 days wage because there are billions more people on the planet and much less silver available.

Go to www.usdebtclock.org and go to the bottom right and corner and look at the gold to dollar ratio and gold to silver ratio. And you will be astounded where it shows gold should be and especially shocked where it says silver should be. And those prices are before the deflationary colllase of asset prices that are coming. So the deal will be absolutely amazing even for those that own even just a little bit of metal. It shows that silver should be at around 800$/oz... now imagine having just a Measly 100 ounces of silver valued at 800 dollars and home prices crashing 90% where a median prices home costs just 25k. You could buy 3 homes with that 100 ounces. And the 100 ounces only cost you 2k to get in this fiat paradigm. Now it might not be that extreme. Maybe it only crashes 75% or 50% but gold and silver still will be MUCH more than they are today so you'll still probably be able to get at least 1 nice house or a business with just 100 ounces of silver. 

Look I love cryptos, but you are playing a very dangerous game is you don't have some god and silver first. I made about 45k in cardano and tron in December. Cashed all of it out except for 5k and bought more gold and silver BecUse what's coming is going to be pretty bad and you will need some real money for it and you will become very wealthy when the currency crisis hits.",18-02-21-04-16,1,219,MichaelAZcats,7yxl3s

Proxy accounts are representatives, just like proxies are in the corporate governance world. Technically, if you're an IBM or Tesla shareholder you can vote on anything from Board of Directors makeup to who the external auditor is going to be - whatever is on the ballot.

The same way living outside a prison is more dangerous as you don't have a meal, a room, and clean clothes guaranteed for you - *but at least you are free*.

The problem with regulation is that we will be forfeiting intrinsic freedom to the same corrupted bureaucrats that Satoshi claimed to attempt to escape. As an example, imagine giving the control of deciding legal and illegal ICOs to a govt committee - soon as they want to roll out their own centralized CentralBankerCoin, there is a conflict of interest and they can undermine any competitor. You may say it is only fair if the committee is made up of trusted members in the crypto community; in which case, I implore you to Google the endless historical examples of ""regulatory capture"" which will make you realize how easy it is for moneyed interests to corrupt regulators and usurp control.

I can't think of a single regulation that will actually benefit the community without taking away our ability to innovate without hurdling obstacles (as ALL regulations do). Regulations may make it ""safer"" but it would lessen our impact and our ability to change the world.

Whether its tax increases to keep up with their need for health support, welfare, unemployment, or their ability to get behind the wheel of a car and run you over. There are consequences to existing with a community/society.

Literally everything you said it has and it should continue, provides EOS token value. Basic supply and demand. Strong coded technology brings development. Development requires large staking or paid leasing. New projects bring more users. Users equal more money and more EOS staked/out of circulation. Sister chains connect back to EOS through interchain communication and EOS wallets will support any EOS IO chain. Soon you won't need to know that you're using apps on different EOS IO chains. Their success is success for EOS and EOS holders are generally airdropped tokens from any new EOS IO chain. Apps can easily be ported to all EOS IO chains and successful features from one chain can easily be added to another. More value, more demand and more staked tokens. 

The hype of all this will snowball and attract more people that have no idea about how any of this works. Pretty much the reason you were here to write this comment. We are in a serious bear market. Too many bought into the market last year with no understanding, crazy expectations and hopes of instantly getting rich. These cycles hit crypto every few years. The tech gradually gets better, the market realizes how much it improved and everyone jumps in. Price becomes unsustainable, everyone jumps out in fear and the development continues. Repeat. The base fundamentals of what gives all crypto value have not disappeared. They continue to grow stronger and I'm not aware of any other blockchain that is developing as fast as EOS IO or even the EOS community.   ",18-12-06-10-55,5,33,Kumomax1911,a3i7mz

6056,"Let's assume we're taking about a CAPTCHA for now (since I don't know of any other approaches that are qualitatively different - although if you do, please rebut me).

To create a CAPTCHA, a system creates a puzzle that only it knows the answer to, and that a computer can't solve. A human solves the puzzle, and submits their answer to the puzzle creator. The puzzle creator checks if the answer is correct, and if so, the test is passed.

Now, the system that sets the puzzles is a piece of equipment that somebody owns. That person can modify it to repeatedly set puzzles that it knows the answer to, and solve them. We have to trust that person not to do that, because otherwise they could automate any of these processes that we want to make hard to automate.

And in all likelihood, the person who owns this system is a whale. Exactly who we were trying to defend against.

As far as I know, there's no system that has solved this problem. This is why we're stuck with poor substitutes, like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.",18-06-27-12-37,1,224,james_pic,8u609v

Another idea would be a system where both your total tokens AND your account have a vote.   This would help discourage whales from breaking their accounts up because the cost/benefit to spreading them to individual accounts would likely be too high, but still give those of us with fewer tokens a greater voice.",18-06-27-12-37,1,1,FunSalt,8u609v

Proper sharding would the biggest breakthrought for blockchain only preceded by satoshi's whitepaper. DPOS does sacrifice decentralization and security for performance. I mean, what do you prefer guarding a blockchain? 21 BP's who all know eachother, voted in by mostly the top 100 EOS tokenholders (which might be decentralized enough...who knows.) , OR 1X1X1X1X independent nodes acting as validators?

Sidenote: The top 100 ETH tokenholders hold 34% of all supply. In EOS that number is far higher.

Apples and oranges. However I would love to see EOS succeed. It's very promising and maybe it's enough decentralized, if proper governance can protect further. But you simply cannot laugh at Vitalik for trying to solve a much much much harder problem, which -if realized- would be far more secure and decentralized, while having the same performance on the mainchain. While governance will be put onto ETH's layer 2 while maintaining a ""code is law"" approach on layer 1.

The amount of problems I ran into would've needed at least 10 dedicated posts to figure out. And people aren't paid for support, so they give you ideas about what could be wrong, but don't take the time to actually diagnose and figure it out. Then there is the problem of one guy helping you, he goes silent, then another guy picks up with a totally different idea of what could be wrong, then when he runs out of ideas he goes silent, and then the thread dies, then 5 years later someone comments ""Hey OP, did you ever get this solved? I'm having the same issue"". And with new software like this, you have to hope that you can find someone who had the same issue as you AND found a solution.

That (and everyone else's understanding) is specifically stating that they are not creating any voting tools, only the command line ""cleos"" program that allows token holders to vote. Greyscale and Scatter.io built wallets off of the cleos program as a community driven method to make it easier for token holders to vote and manage their tokens. This allowed the main net to launch quicker than had we relied on cleos command line interface only.

In addition, Block.One stated from the beginning that they would not help to launch the chain and they didn't. They don't run any nodes or BP's for the network, they didn't offer any votes to help initiate the vote threshold required to launch the main chain. They fully abstained from voting or even recommending any BP's, the community token holders picked everybody without inputs or votes from Block.One. Now that the network is launched, Block.One will use their votes to support block producers that add the most value and health to the network. Voting for good nodes is a requirement for EOS to operate best.

So far all of the FUD against EOS is people (I'm assuming representing other coins) being upset that it is not going perfectly smooth from the start, and that parts of the system are designed in a slightly more central way to ensure faster throughput. EOS still acts a decentralized system, with separate block producers, and Block.One does not run anything on the network. So far everything is going almost exactly as planned.",18-06-29-21-54,2,186,stablecoin,8usja3

While i'm posting here in this thread, what's on my mind is that ultimately my most admired quality in blockchain tech is the uncensorability of a blockchain. Ethereum classic is a great example of uncensorableness. The overall community wanted one thing, but a group of rebels said they would continue on their own path. You could say that's good or bad, but it clearly shows the ability of a network to be resilient amongs ""censorship"" / changes by fiat.

I agree the fudding and bashing is inappropriate.  I didn't like it when btc did it in eth subs, I don't like it when eth  people do it in other subs.

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way though, people have to come to their own realizations most times.

You can't compare it to government spending. You need to compare it company spending. It's very common for all kinds of companies to raise money by creating more shares and selling them. This is what EOS does with the WPS.

EOS is simply infrastructure. It's the BP's job to run the infrastructure, nothing more. The wider community needs to figure these things out on our own through voluntary means.

No. Companies generate their own income by selling goods and services. Governments generate income by stealing it from their citizens through taxation and arbitrary inflation. You're suggesting the latter.

Correct. However forcefully taking money out of the pockets of everyone who takes part in the ecosystem is not a valid solution.

No, EOS is not a business. It's a network running EOSIO software.

This is why I find it embarassing to identify myself with libertarians and ancaps nowadays. When I was younger, libertarians actually did understand something about economics and were willing to discuss everything with open mind. Now it seems more like a religion without any capabilities for critical thinking.

Funding of public goods is a well-known problem. Libertarians can't just act like it doesn't exist. They need to come up with market-based solutions for it. There is a lot of literature written about this.

Here i gave you an example: the lack of stablecoin which would be very beneficial for the ecosystem. Nobody has done it because there hasn't been proper incentives for it. This is completely mainstream economic game theory and it has nothing to do with Marxism.

>EOS is simply infrastructure. It's the BP's job to run the infrastructure, nothing more.

Yeah, BPs run the infrastructure, but who is going to develop it? It should be very clear for everyone that EOS is still far from where it should be. No matter how well the infra is run, people will go elsewhere if the infra is outdated and doesn't offer them what they need. In this sense, EOS is very much a business. It offers a smartcontract platform. If the platform sucks, nobody will use it.

>Companies generate their own income by selling goods and services. Governments generate income by stealing it from their citizens through taxation and arbitrary inflation. You're suggesting the latter.

Companies don't come up with products and services magically. Somebody has to make an investment so that the company has funds to do everything. You are suggesting that issuing new shares is somehow theft. It's clearly not and it's widely used way of raising money in the business world.

Government differ because they are not voluntary. Companies are voluntary, just like EOS. Nobody is forcing you to use EOS. If you think that the business model is bad, then you can go to use some another blockchain. That's basic voluntarism.",18-12-15-04-36,1,152,Samupaha,a66y1m

""Hello fellow libertarians"". Not buying it. You're a statist and you always have been. Nothing about your argument is reasonable or well thought-out. You demonstrate a basic lack of understanding of free market economics.

>Here i gave you an example: the lack of stablecoin which would be very beneficial for the ecosystem. Nobody has done it because there hasn't been proper incentives for it.

What are you talking about? EOS has stable coins for ETH, BTC and USDT. You can trade with them on newdex.

>Yeah, BPs run the infrastructure, but who is going to develop it?

B1? VC's? Anyone who wants? That's like asking who's going to develop the internet. This stuff happens organically if there's profit incentive. There are dapps making millions of dollars right now. Who developed them?

>It offers a smartcontract platform. If the platform sucks, nobody will use it.

Businesses are profit driven; the EOS network is not. It's more comparable to a protocol. If the protocol works people will use it. If it sucks then taxing people isn't going to fix anything. The rest of your argument is complete nonsense based on a false premise that you've imagined.

>If you think that the business model is bad, then you can go to use some another blockchain. That's basic voluntarism

If YOU don't like the EOS platform, then YOU can go somewhere else, rather than trying to force the community to adhere to your socialist ideology, which we did not opt into when we bought our tokens.

I am sure everyone is so fire up when they heard this news about receiving online gaming license and this will ensure that there is a great future for blockchain and online casino. I also think that Although Bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency in history, it was the first one to provide a decentralized structure. This model allows not only for immutability and security, but also for a democratization of value creation. In Bitcoin, anyone can become a miner, profiting from newly issued coins, something that only bankers knew prior to Satoshi's masterpiece.

Blockchain technology brings this same characteristic to gambling, allowing anyone to be a member of the casino itself. Although some Bitcoin casinos allow users to fund the casinos and profit from a share of the house edge, these concept has been taken to the next level by crypto platforms like Ethereum, where projects like vSlice and many others have created a system where token holders receive automatic dividends from the profits generated by the platform.

Wager, on the other hand, employs its own Blockchain network to provide a decentralized sportsbetting platform in which event outcomes are reported by a network of oracle masternodes.

6644,Thanks appreciate your response. You work at multicoin which I respect their research a lot. Defiantly got my vote for BP. I am all in on EOS but I am looking into possibly hedging a bit with another platform or two. You must have done a lot of research at multicoin on dfinity. Multicoin is one of the 4 backers of Dfinity. The one thing that Dfinity seems to have on EOS is a more decentilized consensus algorithim while not sacrificing security or scalability. Both use web assembly both have amazing talent and teams. Both well funded. Both fast block times and finality and throughput. Both on chain governance. Not sure if Dfinity has fees for user or developers? I just wish EOS used their random becan / threshold relay and then EOS wouldn't get shit for people thinking it was too centrilized with DPS 21. ,18-10-12-03-02,1,156,eoseffect,9nb96q

We appreciate your support for Aurora! Just to clarify, I used to work as a researcher at Multicoin. I'm now full time as the CEO of Aurora. I didn't personally spend too much time on Dfinity, but a16z did a good overview:

I think that the best thing Dfinity has going for it is the fast finality. In order for a transaction to be considered irreversible on EOS, it does take some time. Finality is very useful, but it's only one feature. 

&#x200B;

Dfinity claims to be more decentralized, but we have yet to see threshold relay in practice. Remember that the number of validators participating in consensus is just one measure of decentralization. Dfinity is still a proof of stake system, so the distribution of tokens is extremely important when it comes to decentralization, and thus far they've done a sub-par job there, only selling in private sales to accredited investors. Dfinity (afaik) uses a gas model like Ethereum, so there will be transaction fees. Finally, while Dfinity will be more scalable than Ethereum, in terms of actual TPS, we do not know how fast it will be and my guess is that it will still be significantly less performant than EOS.

However, since airdrop hasn’t been done yet, currently our team are still working fully to complete our airdrop with more exchanges in the following week, we could only discuss and give the compensation programs after airdrop issue is settled. 
c. Again, sorry for those who haven’t claimed but were supposed to. We hope you could wait patiently and keep alert with any new updates in our web: eon.org.
d. For Chinese channel, you could also join: https://0.plus/#/EONOfficialCN.   ""

The airdrops and the possibility of renting out your stake in the block chain is very appealing to me.  I believe it was eos vibes that described the block chain as real estate and token holders owning a plot of land. The only things that scares me are security and the rate of inflation. IMHO the inflation rate should be sufficient to reward the BP's for their hard work and then after that it should be kept to the minimum required to expand the chain.

If you give a dividend directly from BP people will vote for the biggest dividend which will be a race to the bottom. BPs will spend all funds on dividends instead of good hardware.

The only way that could possibly work is if somehow you can programmatically tie the dividend to performance but there are so many factors it would be incredibly hard to quantify. Even then it would hurt the smaller upcoming BPs since they would not be able to compete with established BP that are already producing blocks and a monopoly would form where voting for change would cost you money in lost dividends.

7066,"A pump has a much faster increase in price. EOS had a lot of pump & dumps, you can see this easily in the graph (fast increase in price followed by a slow decrease to a level lower than the price before the pump). However this time is a slow & steady price increase, and the figure is very bullish, the volume is also high, so this is not a pump & dump. The decrease in volume is usually accompanied of a decrease in price, but this time has not happened, the order book is kinda nice as well and there is a lot of volume on bid side that will stop price from falling. 
From a valuation perspective, EOS market cap is roughly $500 millions, and the supply is only 50% of total supply, so we can say EOS market cap is $1 billion if we count the total supply. 
EOS will raise several billions from the ICO, they already raised $700 millions with the price falling, so we can safely say that they will raise 2$ billions at least. There is also $1 billion from VC to fund EOS dapps. So EOS market cap should be MINIMUM $3 billions. That means a present price of $7 in the worst case scenario.

Put another way, if EOS maintains its current price of $1.12 at launch, the market cap of the token would be $1.052 billion, making it the 13th biggest crypto by today's standards.

The worry is not any one BP acting maliciously, but it is the risk of many colluding together to ""force"" the community to make certain decisions- around technical upgrades, supply, etc.  If this starts to happen (like having candidate BPs voting to increase supply to pay for RAM startup), then you will see on-chain ""governance"" start to cheapen and be less meaningful.",18-06-08-18-21,7,16074,DCinvestor,8pi7xn

7218,"A 51% attack is a black and white situation.  This type of issue is far more insidious.

The potential issue is that BPs are major economic participants in the system, who stand to be enriched by certain economic decisions in ways that users are not.  They can push the envelope around things, and collectively vote with their own holdings (which are substantial), to lend credibility to certain proposals.  If they start to become more powerful, or make decisions that don't benefit or hurt users, then you'll start to have problems.  And those issues may not be of a magnitude which results in a hard fork, but overall make the platform less attractive / reputable.

However, they are using web sockets for data transfer so the information are hidden from the browser side unless you can sniff the network.

Unfortunately, it seems like this is the only way to generate random numbers as recommended by Dan himself on the following [post](https://eosio.stackexchange.com/questions/41/how-can-i-generate-random-numbers-inside-a-smart-contract).

Also on this github [post](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/2643#issuecomment-385482304), they also explained the reason why rand() function is not supported in smart contract.

So if anyone thinks EOSBet is honest, you could be wrong because all the logics are on their server and it is a black box.

Unless someone can come up with a smart way to generate random numbers on the blockchain and make it open source, I would say that all these gambling sites may not be as honest as you think.

7528,"Like anything, the concern is probably *collusion*. This may not happen directly, but the likelihood of colluding parties is higher when parties have similar aligned interests. The fact is that block producers have a tremendous amount of influence. This is compounded by the fact that they also have significant resources at their disposal. In a perfect world, we would expect that the producers will be honest actors and continue to act in the best interest of themselves and the “hand that feeds them”. Yet, we know that this is not always the case! As a parallel just look at the financial industry or politics and the number of incidents of price fixing, insider trading, false reporting, market manipulation, mishandled certification, etc. Those are just the illegal ones we know about... others are legal but highly questionable (reverse mergers, industry lobbying, gerrymandering, etc).

Consider the effects of “lobbying” in politics and how much influence it has on everything from the economy, policy, voting, etc. This inevitably happens in any system that requires governance, so as a counter measure it’s usually necessary to form an appropriate (equally powerful) independently funded honest oversight entity - good luck finding one of those in the real world btw... Take net neutrality as a benchmark and imagine what would happen if you allowed corporations to directly dictate the the policy governing their industry? That’s akin to  legally letting Pablo Escobar “build his own prison and assign his own oversight” imagine how many rules were manipulated there...

The conclusion here is that this reality of ever present threats to the network needs to be considered in the architecture of the system itself. The network is, in and of itself, a giant contract between multiple actors and interests and disregard for those subtleties in the interactions between parties may result in a terribly dishonest system (cartels and collusion) or worse.",18-08-16-21-25,2,1,tenka3,97rg21

I don't know how they can mutate the blockchain and leave with the money, but I can think of many scenarios where a malicious actor could destroy people's confidence in EOS for comparatively very little money (compared to purchasing enough hash power to do a 51% attack in Bitcoin) and make it profitable.

The reason Bitmain hasn't done a 51% attack on Bitcoin is not because they like Bitcoin. It's because they are overinvested in Bitcoin. That's how they got to being in the position for a 51% attack in the first place. If Bitcoin is destroyed not only do they lose whatever Bitcoin they hadn't sold already, but they have hundreds of millions in hardware and infrastructure that they can't do much with.

Compare this to BPs. Think of how much money you need to invest in order to control most BPs. It's nothing compared to the amount of money you need to have 51% hash power in Bitcoin. In my opinion the balance is broken and it's only a matter of time before someone decides to short EOS and see it burn.

So this rich entity needs to pay those bps, all 15 of them, handsomely enough to recoup all the money they've invested in infrastructure so far, and for all their potential ( significant) future earnings? That's nonsense, in the same way that bitmain attacking bitcoin is nonsense - they all have too much invested to do it. 

It would cost billions to buy out 15 bps and compensate them for past and future losses.

Let's say you create a new ""dapp"" (we'll pretend for now that it really is decentralised). You're also generously paying the $20 fee for all new accounts.

You now need to make $20 from each user.

Dapps dont work this way either because there is no user data to really sell. Everything is on a public ledger. You cant sell that stuff because everyone has access to it. At best you can sell email addresses but even that is a stretch.

> No matter how you spin it, if you don't want to hemorrhage money giving out free accounts, you need to make yourself a centralised component that the system doesn't work without.

The way you make money with dapps is using this stuff called cryptocurrency. That is how money is made with dapps. User data and ad revenue dont exist as options on this medium.

> Note that I'm not saying EOS is centralised. It isn't. I'm saying that any app using your proposed business model has to be centralised.

No it doesn't and there are working examples of exactly what I talked about right now and they work fine. Steem costs money to make accounts as well. Steemit 2.0 will work the same way. Its decentralized. In fact using ad revenue and user data requires a centralized system. But most dapps right now use neither because they simply dont support that model.

Also its worth pointing out that making a wallet is something the user needs to do. I can make a dapp and never have to make a wallet for anyone if I don't care too.",18-07-03-17-24,4,0,[deleted],8vq9m7

Not sure if proxy accounts will be common, but they may be. I think that you will mostly just be using your wallet directly to speak to the dapp like its an account. 

>Since only the second option is free for the user; how is this different than ETH devs setting up proxy accounts and paying Gas fees for their users? 

This can work and it would be fine IMHO

Problem is that it once again highlights how self gratifying the ETH community is when it comes to purity tests but the moment push comes to shove the most ideal methods to move forward will throw out pretty much all of that purity in an instant. I say it over and over again, when you move into the dapps space you are at the mercy of the dapps developers. 

And in this case, what your propose would work great for ETH, but it would also be a pretty centralized solution thus they would probably want to go further down the gambit to ensure dapps developers are forced to collaborate to some kind of constitution and rule of law. Code is Law will not work within a dapps space. A single bug or exploit or god knows what else can wipe your wallet in heart beat. 

Otherwise, you are now forced to either choose to funnel all transactions through a 15 TPS limit or basically let a third party have full control over everything you do within the dapp. And you basically end up with whales and dapps devs acting like warlords in an anarchy.

8256,"I don’t think UBI is going to be proposed on the EOS blockchain anytime in the near future (1 year+) 

I think Dan is passionate about finding solutions that make the world better and fairer but I also agree that unless UBI was enforced on all major blockchains, it would be a net negative for EOS because 4/5% could be put to better use and I don’t think the PR or adoption potential would justify that expense long term. 

Blockchain is still in the early stages of adoption so in normal to bull markets it can overcome a 4/5% expense whether it be UBI/Mining/Other but it is not a long term sustainable model imo. ETH is moving to a much lower inflation POS (one day..)  and BTC inflation decreases over time too. 

So in a few years the percentage inflation and how productively it’s used will make a much larger difference than is observable today.

As for the governance model, I think REX will go a long way to getting average users voting and I think this will probably make it better from a governance standpoint than most existing blockchains. 

I am however opposed to ECAF, I don’t think it needs to be done at protocol level, Individual DAPPs and custody solutions can offer similar functions for the very few current users that want it & the future mainstream users who we speculate are more likely to appreciate it.",18-11-17-05-07,3,195,Babble9753,9xol3w

Not sure where you got this system from. In the US in the late 1700s the requirement in most states to vote was you had to own property, or be a net tax payer (... and be white). Ignoring the racial component, this isn't as ""unfair"" of a system as voting weighted solely by weighted wealth. The problem is it requires identity or 1 vote per person. This isn't something that's been addressed yet on the blockchain as there's no way to tell a person is unique. Dan's UBI idea encourages people to ""prove their identity is unique"" for UBI. As a disclaimer, I am not a supporter of Dan's UBI as I don't believe it'll work.",18-11-17-05-07,3,33,_degenerategambler,9xol3w

8259,"- Biometric input to allow a unique individuals a greater voice will not be mandatory and the scan does not attach your finger print to your wallet. Everything stays trusted, anonymous and transparent. There are many ways to accomplish this with the EOS network. A very simple method would be to write a unique number into a contract for every print. Everytime someone attempts to login, the wallet calls on the contract for an approval that the current number has not been used. Key pairs could even be used. A better option would be a decenteralized web of anon individuals that can confirm identity information. There's a lot of information on this tech if your willing to look into it.

- A modern democracy does not equal 1 person 1 vote. Votes are weighted. The U.S. even uses delegates and superdelegates. This is pretty much the exact model EOS uses but more weight will shift to unique users as optional unique identification is deployed. No system is perfect but if you can't see how this is safer or at the very least just as safe as the rich controlling hashing power, generally through only 3-4 entities, you don't want to see it. You'll never be convinced. That's fine. Your free to buy what you want but you will only hurt the entire by not cheering on the market leading blockchains and suggesting doomsday scenarios. All because you have another opinion. Especially, when you imply only children buy EOS. Children follow the heard. The heard isn't with EOS. That's pretty clear.

- UBI is nothing more than an award system that uses the already existing WP fund. It's a way for EOS to have more distribution, a small amount of computing resources for new users interested in trying some dapps and a chance for average Joe's to finally own some of that crytpo they have always heard about. This isn't UBI like you see in real life. You aren't going to be coasting in life off Dan's simple reward system. Lordy. 

If you don't agree or don't understand EOS and you want stick with something else, that's fine. Know that these types of posts only hurt whatever project you are into and these posts were all too common when Ethereum was gaining popularity. They same tone of disdain, the same recycled talking points that people read from their favorite proponents of BTC, the same fear spreading, warnings of it imploding and lots of scam posts. They didn't stop until Eth reached hundreds. This behavior will continue for any crypto that threatens the popular investments. This is how this works and it's a shame. Especially because the concepts of EOS have taken another step up in complexity. This makes it much harder and more lengthy to explain. Also, this makes it very easy to point to certain aspects and say ""look that seems bad!"".",18-11-17-05-07,3,33,Kumomax1911,9xol3w
8260,"Good points. Governance is undoubtedly one of the most difficult aspects of this new technology. The Bitcoin model of governance (miners with the greatest computing power win) has its merits: the miners have economic investment and ""skin in the game"", and the competition causes the strongest to survive... it's capitalism. 

I'm no expert, and I'm going out on a limb with this, but can the planet handle another 100 years of raw capitalism? Yes, there would continue to be incredible technological gains, however it would likely come with massive societal suffering as the ""weak"" and voiceless starve and global resources are exploited for the wealthy.

So, is there another, more inclusive way? And, is that way simply socialism, with its history of tyranny and bloodshed? Socialism, in my view, is a failure and is not an option.

No, EOS's present system of governance is not perfect. But I'm optimistic that, by allowing changes to its constitution and by testing new forms of governance on sidechains (such as Telos), that we can engage and experiment and follow a just path of governance. Personally, I need to look for a sustainable form of governance, and EOS provides an attractive platform for learning about these issues. Finding ""crypto-economic solutions for securing life, liberty, property, and justice for all"", as per Dan Larimer's stated mission, seems to be a good foundation for determining a better way forward. 

I need to throw in a disclaimer here: I'm just a layperson trying to think these things through. I have no expertise or formal education in governance or economics, so I have plenty of homework to do before I attempt to join any discussion on these issues. My views will likely change over the next year as I continue to learn. I just figured it's better to join the conversation than lurk on the sidelines!",18-11-17-05-07,3,41,Roger_Wilcoin,9xol3w
8261,"You grossly underestimate the fact that EOS was created to be forked, side-chained, killed, and created very easily. When you expand the time-horizon, the landscape looks something like bitcoin, where centralized entities run slightly different versions of the code and together make up a decentralized ecosystem. I keep 80% in EOS because there’s a lot of value to the global distribution that the crowdsale achieved and it’s highly likely that a community-induced fork of the main chain will keep nearly the same token balances. I sleep well at night for this reason alone.

The main chain of EOS can ultimately fail like any democracy, but it would have to be by failure of the block-producers to give the community what they want.

The author uses the term “pedophilia” and the expressions “sexually assaulting” and “sexually abusing” related to names with no real need to do so.
The author uses the expression “buggy blockchain”; which is, again, despective and misleading. And under that title relates some episodes about ECAF and Blockproducers behaviour in a biased manner. As far as I know, on the aerly stages ECAF acted on good faith following claims and under Constitution (they also motivated their resolutions brieflly (as usual in emergency measures taken by arbitrators outside blockchain); and no Blockproducer with a medical emergency was threatened with a lawsuit for failing to comply ECAF orders (the author appoints some whatsapp messages as his source of knowledge).  
The author exaggerates (mislead) when he says: 
“Since going live, the EOS network has struggled with defective source code”.
Finally, the author mislead again when he talks about active dapps; because he knows (its said before on the same article) that the network was launched on june.  
“As of June, ethereum had eight decentralized applications running on it with 300 or more active users, while EOS had three. Ethereum launched in 2015”.

8293,"Not an ETH maximlists here, I truly love EOS and I'm voicing my concerns.

ETH has the scaling updates in front of it.  When they're launched the cost of gas will plummet. It will take years of heavy transactions count to reach the price of an EOS account which will only go up. The ""EOS Ghost Town"" theory has very sound footing. 

And there's a chicken and the egg problem in the EOS reasoning. If I'm a dev I want as many users for my app as possible. But being a crypto project my users have to be first onboarded on the platform and then my app. Ideally the users would be already onboarded on the platform and familiar with how to use it and operate on it. Compared to ETH the number of users on EOS is dramatically smaller. This number would grow if there were attractive Dapps on the platform. But there aren't. So as a Dev I would wonder why should I choose a platform with very few users versus one with a ton of users. The value proposition this far was that it was very cheap and fast. But it isn't anymore and has high friction for new users (where the initial promises were that they are striving for indistinguishable experience versus web apps). And if ETH gets fast with their scaling updates what's there left for EOS? Is it a better proposition to ask new users to pay upfront their future activity, or let them pay as they go?

I think there's some misconceptions here. You will NEVER need to put your private key into a website.

Scatter is a chrome extension ( akin to metamask ) which allows you to sign transactions on webpages without manually inserting your private keys there. You will be putting _a_ private key into Scatter, which runs locally on your machine in a clean environment on the browser outside of the reachable scope of applications, never inside of a website. The entire purpose of Scatter is to make sure you **never** have to enter your private key in any website. Ever.

Scatter is as secure as a desktop wallet. For more information about the security measures you can refer to https://github.com/EOSEssentials/Scatter#security Scatter is also open-source, and you are all more than welcome to read the code.

I don't have any proof of that but the facts are:

  * It would be very easy for them to recycle their ETH
  * They are continuing to funnel money from the contract into exchanges
  * They promised to provide an audit to set these concerns to rest and have not delivered anything but excuses so far

8472,"I don't think you quite understand.  Imagine they earn $1000 from legitimate EOS token sales.  Then they use that money to buy $1000 worth of EOS from themselves.  
All they've done here is take $1000 worth of EOS out of circulation, but they make it look like someone really wanted to buy $1000 worth of EOS.  ",18-02-02-11-40,1,12711,ifisch,7uni7v

Why are you up in arms over this?

Your investment is preserved, the technology gets more attention b/c it's higher in perceived value, which creates more interest and which creates more dApp development, and thus everyone wins. I repeat, this is exactly what reddit did when this very platform was started.

I'm not sure why you think I don't get it.

8580,"Thanks for your insightful explanation! For the record, /u/jman76358 is a nefarious FUDster here, don't listen to him.

The reason why it would be ""confiscated"" is because EOS tokens represent a portion of the EOS network. If all the tokens start getting held up and never used, not only would the voting system be broken, but the network itself would be compromised. There are also more advanced reasons too which I hope someone could explain but that's the gist of it. 

Simpler explanation: EOS tokens are not inherently coins or currency, they are considered **Real Estate**. They're an *asset* to be used. Imagine buying a house and leaving it vacant for 3 years without doing any maintenance whatsoever. Plants would grow, the house starts to decay, animals and squatters may even break into it.

EDIT: If you use your tokens at *any* time within those 3 years, even for just voting, you **won't lose** anything!

8590,"1. (almost?) nobody wants EOS confiscations to happen. As eos nyc said:

  > We can confirm that this constitutional article will never be ratified long enough for it to take effect. We have not seen a single token holder support it, nor do we support it. We hope it’s changed.

2. current version of constitution is only a place holder until the smart contract for its validation for each article independently is up.

3. Constitution doesn't matter, consensus decides everything

4. Nobody is sure what interpretation means. Even Dan debates both sides: https://i.imgur.com/68tr6YD.png

5. As mentioned above, requires soft fork to even work with community support, and there's 3 years before it would even go into effect.

6. Out of all suggestions it might only mean 2 things, both automatic:

  * shared unused resources like ram/cpu/net/storage/alias are released but funds are safe and accessible with old private and public key. auction refers to ram/storage being sold off on market automatically with funds given to account holders balance. vested coins are unvested but still there.

  or

  * instead of simply releasing all non-eos property like ram/cpu/net/storage/alias/tokens(not eos)/anything-else-imaginable that might be tied to an account, it's auctioned off as a whole on free market automatically with ENTIRE proceeds measured in EOS going to original account holder and proceeds accessible with original owner public and private key.

None of these involve your EOS being taken away - just deals with how to avoid somebody permanently reserving huge % of network resources and how to make sure they keep their wealth in full. First scenario for example might not address a really really nice alias or some amazing permission to some kind of smart contract that an account has, so instead of simply releasing those, it would be auctioned off and instead of getting 0 for those the owner would get its worth in EOS during auction.

You can see how a whale lets say that's owner of 10% of ram shouldn't probably get to keep those 10% of ram if he can't even do a single 0 cost action for 3 years and forever own 10% of up to millions of tb of ram that might be available forever making it inaccessible to everyone else?",18-06-24-02-53,1,647,awasi868,8tb8qn

8647,"Yes it would require a separate set of block producers, though there's also nothing that would stop block producers on the main chain from setting up hardware to run on any additional side chains that pop up.

Here's a video that explains [side chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4z13HqRjFU) (although it's specific to how it's proposed for Ethereum). Basically, you've got code that works between the two chains which ensures you've got tokens and the side chain then performs whatever action you're attempting to take.

I haven't dug into the technical details too heavily, but here's my understanding of it:

Applications being run on a side chain would be run on a completely different set of system resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth), but still rely on the original tokens. Think of it like sharding, but if the shard has it's own ecosystem rather than just being a smaller chunk of the network. Any changes that need to be made to an account on the side of the main chain can be sent via an interblockchain message, though those will probably be limited in some way since it sounds like they're 10x more costly than the messages sent internally. Likewise, since it is a separate chain, it could also have it's own token based off your holdings (like a fork) which are specific to that chain - but it all comes down to specific implementation (and I haven't seen any of those propositions so it's really just speculation).

I can't find it at the moment, but there was a recent block producer call where Dan laid out his ideas for side chains.

As far as governance, I could see it going either way. I could see some being (potentially) run with different rules, and others where they prefer to adhere to the constitution on the main chain. All of it again really boils down to how these things are implemented because it's only going to be limited by design and code.

It's not something that's set in stone, but I think it's something that'd be beneficial for a ton of reasons (including having separate resource pools), and I think that alone might be enough to make it a reality. No matter what, eventually the maximum amount of RAM will be hit (talking about tech limits, not how much is bought currently). The only way to ensure that EOS is scalable when that happens is by expanding with additional chains. If EOS is only lightly used, it won't really matter. If a lot of large apps show up, it will end up being a must. That I think is enough to say that it likely will happen - but there's always the possibility of other solutions being chosen instead.

8652,"Sidechains are entirely new chains. That's for large corporations to set up. And even then, you cannot summon public trust automatically by centralizing all block producers into the same institution -- which is the business that owns the token that's being ICO'd. 

""Sidechains"" running their own tokens will be rare and will be limited to very large consortiums of several businesses that somehow have an incentive to start a blockchain that's subordinate to the EOS chain. But if you already have a sufficiently large quorum of organizationally decentralized set of producers then you are set to launch your own chain. There's no reason to make it subordinate to the EOS main chain. You can launch your own token and then you can communicate with whatever chain -- not just EOS -- using whatever inter-chain communication mechanisms are made available.

Either EOS competes with Ethereum and solves the ICO-for-everyone use case that was shown to be massively popular with Ethereum, or it's going to be an elitist platform and it's going to fail. It should do sharding ASAP. If Ethereum can scale TPS by 100X with sharding, EOS can scale RAM by 100X with sharding too, and it should do that. It's better to have ICOs spread across the RAM on 100 shards running on the same 21 main EOS BPs than having the weird complexities of sidechains -- which are a huge barrier of entry for 99.9% of ICOs.",18-07-10-19-55,1,124,fcecin,8xnjfi

""According to Weibo, some of the bugs present in the code for the EOS platform would allow arbitrary code to be executed remotely on EOS nodes, potentially even permitting attackers to take full control of nodes.

The team at Qihoo 360 claims that through the use of malicious smart contracts, hackers could have the ability to trigger a security bug. When the hostile smart contract becomes part of a new block, it could turn all full nodes vulnerable to attacks. The extent of the problem would extend to backup nodes, exchanges, wallet nodes if this is true.

The Qihoo 360 team has apparently reported the bugs to the EOS team. The EOS team responded by stating that the “EOS network will not be officially launched until these issues are fixed”. The Qihoo 360 team also pleaded through their Weibo site that cryptocurrency projects should be more cautious with the security.

I'm not dead set on the need for every man and his raspberry pi to be able to run a full node, but most would say an average user should be able to run a full node if they so desire. The performance improvements in throughput and latency for EOS are almost entirely due the fact there are only 121 full nodes in the EOS network allowing hardware and connectivity to be ramped up.

Good luck on the launch though, I personally think there is room to explore on the spectrum between decentralisation and performance. I just think EOS leans too far in the direction of performance at the expense of decentralisation... If it moves towards greater decentralisation in the future I could be persuaded to take a second look.

This is both because of the politics involved, and because it was never originally designed for scalability/speed, which is why the proposed solutions have so much overhead and complexity involved. People will use Ethereum when they don't need speed and they do need guaranteed immutability. Also, Vitalik is a technology genius, but seems to know very little about economics, and seems to care little about mainstream adoption, which has been and will continue to be a problem for Ethereum from an investment point of view.

Coupled with the idea that EOS airdropping will become the blueprint for project development in the future (i.e. airdrops will do what ICO's did for ETH). EOS represents a significant threat to the traditional ""manipulated"", crypto markets. 

Rem - they don't have to influence all the altcoins, they only have to decide what price BTC will be - and the rest of the market follows. Dominance level is not based on utility, BTC falls behind in most features (except security). BTC has dominance because most trading pairs are based on BTC as a gateway. Imagine if all exchanges dropped their BTC trading pairs, in favor of a no-mine, more democratic, more stable, smart contract based alternative.
Yes, EOS is centralised (at the moment), and yes it is fungible, and has freeze / roll-back capabilities - but all of these things are needed if a crypto is going to be used in business solutions.

There are no extra barriers to entry for women in the crypto space. Any perceived lack of women on development teams boils down to a lack of qualified/interested candidates, not discrimination. In fact[ studies have been done](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888) that show employers in STEM fields have bias *towards* hiring women when the opportunity arises. Moreover, [other studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/) have shown that the gender gap in STEM widens the more egalitarian a society is; women follow their passions when social conditions allow for it, and those passions [tend not to be](https://i.imgur.com/FKyAGMB.jpg) computer science and engineering for most. *And there's nothing wrong with that.*

>The only reason you even noticed or paid attention is because it’s so uncommon to even see one woman on a blockchain related project.

The reason I noticed is because that was the entire basis of their pitch and it's literally in their name. ""Vote for us because we're women"". Shoulda learned from Hillary that cheap tricks don't win votes.

>The idea that you would withhold your vote because they are “unfair” toward males is super lame.

I'm not a fan of sexism and discrimination, in particular when it's done under the guise of a noble cause. If you think this is ""super lame"" then your opinion is irrelevant to me and I'm not interested in anything else that you have to say.

>How about you become a better human and stop putting so much attention to tiny bits of unfairness toward men from women. 99.999% percent of the time the unfairness goes the other way.

How about you become a better human and stop spreading such complete nonsense. I would react the same way to an explicitly men-only team/scholarship. Women already have an easier time getting scholarships and jobs in tech when they're equally qualified as their male counterparts, in particular because so many employers and schools have unrealistic quotas based on the faulty premise that gender gaps indicate discrimination, and overcompensate.

Why aren't you advocating for more female construction workers, welders, garbage women, pest controllers, Alaskan tuna fishers, janitors, truck drivers, or plumbers? Women make up only 8% of workplace fatalities. Is that something you want to rectify as well? Is it unfair for women that they're burdened with higher high school graduation rates, better grades, and significantly more university degrees per capita? How come you empathetic equality lovers never talk about the fact that men make up 75% of suicides and are 85% of the homeless population?

>Before you respond, I want you to really stop and consider... why is it that it bothers you so much?

Because I'm tired of political zealots trying to infiltrate my field of work and hobbies with their rancid, discriminatory ideologies, and I've seen first hand what happens when teams hire people based on what's between their legs rather than their skill-sets and level of competence.

>Women are not a different team or tribe, they are just trying to give a fairer shake to others who normally don’t get a fair shake.

Which is why they've created a literal female-only tribe that actively discriminates against men? I'm not the one sitting here telling women that they shouldn't be hired or given scholarships. I couldn't care less what they look like as long as they do a good job.

The main complaint is that it reverted *every recorded transaction* as a consequence of censoring *one* illicit transaction.

In other words, EOS has a system designed to account for these inevitable problems so that such disruptive measures as a hard fork are not necessary.",18-06-23-23-57,2,121,Memec0in,8ta34r

Why not advocate for more strict checks and balances then instead of arguing that the system is fundamentally flawed, when it's clear from this conversation that you don't actually believe that? As far as ECAF goes, that's a place holder until a DAC can properly fill the role. With that said, they cannot act unilaterally. In fact they have no executive power, as they can't force BP's to comply with their rulings, and cannot remove BP's from power for failing to comply. Only voters can do that.

>And, Ethereum doesn't have that functionality because the Ethereum protocol is secured by a REAL blockchain....not a pseudo-blockchain susceptible to a multitude of security breaches.

Empty rhetoric. The EOS blockchain is fundamentally the same as the Ethereum blockchain from a technical/high level point of view.

I think EOS is decentralized, at least when compared to mining pools, but it's also more mutable (purposely so) than ETH. EOS decentralization is more about external censorship-resistance, not internal consensus resistance, in my opinion.

EOS purposefully avoids forks by establishing a consensus process amongst the BPs regarding software updates. The real question is, if the 4-5 ETH mining pools were to simply update their software wouldn't this fork become the ETH main net? Isn't the real ETH just the fork with the most hashing power behind it?",18-06-26-01-06,3,489,wdnboss,8tr8h7

9477,"The real ETH is the fork with the most hashing power behind it simply because most exchanges have set a precedent that this is what they will follow however we don't know really know how the Ethereum Foundation would respond to a contested fork that succeeds their desired fork. They hold the trademark to Ethereum so technically if any fork succeeds that they do not approve of, they can probably make costly legal attacks. This makes me question the centralization of Ethereum.

And in the Bitcoin corner: We've also seen BitMain and ViaBTC's verbal attacks on Bitcoin Core and their heavy promotion of Bitcoin Cash. These two mining pools control well over 51&#37; of Bitcoin Core fork. Now they haven't attacked the Bitcoin core fork (which they easily could) which provides a pretty credible argument to EOS as well as to why block producers simply aren't going to go rogue on the chain which is the heavy fud that's spread around here. If people are still insecure about BPs going rogue then voting in BPs that have taken on financial investments from VCs/Private/Public would be in our best interest since those BPs are bound by fiduciary duty to run EOS in fashion that promotes stability.",18-06-26-01-06,2,1,richerthanyou89,8tr8h7

9479,"I believe the centralized/decentralized thing is a by-product of what might be a definition of a 'security'. 

 - For something to have been sold as a security there needs to have been a implication from the seller that the buyer could reasonably hope for a positive financial return on that investment. The terms of the EOS ICO specifically excluded any such implication.

- The positive-return needs to be something promoted or controlled by the issuing entity: in the EOS ICO, block.one specifically said that they would not be doing anything other than making the eos.io software, and that should there be any commercial benefit to arise from subsequent use of that software then that would be generated by 'the community' (ie, not block.one).

Within 23 hours after the end of the final period on June 1, 2018 at 22:59:59 UTC, all EOS Tokens will become fixed (ie. frozen) and will become non-transferrable on the Ethereum blockchain. At this point the EOS Token distribution will be complete and any person who wishes to launch a public blockchain platform adopting the open source EOS.IO Software (an “EOS Platform”) will be able to generate a file or “snapshot” showing the fixed balances of the EOS Tokens from the state of the Ethereum blockchain (the “Snapshot”). As block.one will not configure and/or launch any EOS Platform, block.one will have no control over when, how or whether the EOS.IO Software is adopted or implemented, or how, when or whether a Snapshot will be created or used or whether an EOS Platform is launched.

In order for the balance of your EOS Tokens to be included in the Snapshot if a Snapshot is created, you must register your Ethereum address with an EOS public key.

------

Please note:

Registration is not necessary prior to participating in the EOS Token distribution.
Registration is only required once for each Ethereum address, even if this address is used multiple times to participate in the EOS Token distribution.
You should hold all of your EOS Tokens in the same Ethereum address and register your EOS public key to that Ethereum address.
Do not register the address of an exchange account, if you hold EOS tokens in an exchange account, you need to transfer your EOS tokens to an Ethereum address which you have full control over before the EOS Tokens become non-transferable on the Ethereum blockchain which is expected to occur within 23 hours after the end of the final period on June 1, 2018 at 22:59:59 UTC and then use your own Ethereum address to register. We suggest you not wait until the last minute to register your Ethereum address with an EOS private and public key pair.
If you hold EOS tokens in multiple Ethereum address, you need to register EOS keys for each one.
If you wish to transfer your EOS tokens to another Ethereum address, you can generate a new pair of EOS public and private keys and register them with your new Ethereum address.
You can always generate a new pair of EOS public and private keys and register them with your Ethereum address. Every time you do this, the existing keys will be replaced with the new EOS public and private keys.

----
Use MYETHERWALLET to send your registration transaction.  This is a tx on the Ethereum network to link your current ETH address holding your EOS erc20/ICO tokens to your newly created public EOS key.

In any decentralized coin an address can freeze if the majority of the miners (1 or 2 pools) decides to ignore incoming transactions from a specific address and drop blocks that contain them coming from other miners. This would practically freeze the coins stored in that address. 
The difference in eos is that, if proven the account and the lost funds can be recovered as well by getting another pub/private key pair assigned if 71% of the block producers decide it.

On the other hand, if they get to a market cap of that 18 mln they will buy about 500.000 EOS. That's a heck of a lot, but they might need it to go mainsteam and to make a lot of accounts (ram). The team does look a bit small to me (and why would you mention your bridge championship?), and their pricing (pg17) seems very cheap to me. My guess is that if the project succeeds, they will be swallowed by survey monkey in no time. But I also see potential issues.

1. This was a mistake in our whitepaper and we are changing that.  The yearly revenue of market research industry is around 44.5 bln USD as found here:[https://www.statista.com/statistics/242477/global-revenue-of-market-research-companies/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/242477/global-revenue-of-market-research-companies/)
2. We do not sell all the 120 mln tokens. We sell only 80 mln, so 2/3. This is like round 1 of financing. The rest will be used partly for promotion, and bigger part to sell at higher token prices and have second round of financing. Survey gizmo collected around 80 mln to compete with Survey Monkey, so in order to fully compete we hope to sell the remaning tokens for at least 1/2 USD \~ 80 mln USD and have second round of financing covered.
3. Small team - true - this is why we raising funds - for at least 2-3 teams of top level developers within 3-4 months after ICO.

eos blockchain is paused, but eos tokens on exchanges are bouncing around wallets as they are traded, because the chain is down, none of the changing of hands is recorded. 
eos chain comes back online, but missing many transactions - these transactions 'never occurred' .

It becomes a problem when you put fiat value on the token. It's not really a problem if the token is just a utility; if EOS is truly a utlity, then pausing the chain is much like Windows forcing you to do nothing when its in midst of upgrade. Nothing gets done when the chain is down.
AND THATS KINDA THIS GUYS POINT - if you store your tokens on exchange, then your tokens are NOT protected. If they are in your own wallet, then you're great.

how's the hack work:
0:00 chain pauses, cause price to dip
0:01 attacker sells his coin to those buying the dip
0:05 buyer think he is getting a good deal, growing bags
0:05 attacker moves funds into another coin, or cash - whatever - doesn't matter what it is, just not paused token
0:10 chain comes back up - back to 0:00, where the chain was paused. 
Attacker maintains ownership of token, buyer never bought token - but funds where moved out, no 'redo'.

Because it takes longer for my proportionately smaller rig to solve the puzzle than a combination of rigs with much a higher hashrate. Moving to a mining with a pool means you'd get your reward more consistently, instead of one big fat reward when you mine the block. Important thing to NOTE is that I'd still get the REWARD --- I CAN RUN and VALIDATE A FULL NODE. That is not an option on EOS. There are 121 nodes and that's it. You can do nothing with regards to actually validating/helping achieve consensus with your machine. By design, in EOS you can't run a full node.

""Make sure you use active and not a private key"" is a little misleading. You will always need to use your private key in trusted wallets.

Instead try ""Make sure you use more than one set of keys. Take the set with the highest authority (labeled ""Owner"" by default.) and store it off any internet connected device. 

This way if your primary ""active"" private key is ever compromised, you can use your ""owner"" private key to block an unauthorized user and immediately change your ""active"" key set. This gives you three days to stop an unauthorized attempt to remove your staked funds.

Creating new key sets with different levels of permission is fairly unique to EOS IO and every user should take advantage of it. This hack would not have been possible if the user followed this direction.

> By setting max bet, we can prevent from running out of bankroll. Allowing a higher max bet can benefit big players and allow them to play with many strategies. Although probability and numbers are calculated accurately, players can still consecutively win. To prevent bankruptcy, some platforms set a fixed max bet in ratio to their bankroll. For example, they will set 1000 as a cap for each bet if they have 100K bankroll, leaving a room to some lucky players. However, it’s hard to raise the max bet because we need lots of bankroll to do this. We have another way to accomplish this:

On average, the max bet is raised \~100x with the same bankroll using this mechanism. We don’t need to set the max bet manually. Our system will protect us from going bankrupt automatically.

He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a “distributed collaborative entity,” is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone’s ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet.

Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn’t discouraged him.

...

Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data.

Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved.

That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic.

Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet.

He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people’s private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. ",18-11-02-09-48,1,141,besthingsinliferfree,9tee1y

10089,But one thing gets me thinking: the video as proof of identity for arbitration. I mean today there is tech that is able to put someone else's face on your body. What will happen in the next years? Where is EOS core arbitration based? The proceedings are conducted only online?,18-10-21-23-31,2,45,Libertarian777,9q35n4
10090,"The 3 year thing is true. Not FUD, but the way it's portrayed is disingenuous. First of all, this is probably the first constitutional article to get dumped in the next revision so the whole thing may be a moot point. But assuming it stays, in the very unlikely event that it does, you need to literally do nothing at all for 3 years. Any transaction, including voting, liking a post on an EOS based social network, or any other interaction with a dApp will reset the counter.

There are going to be so many things that incentivize voting (e.g. REX) or incentivize making transactions (e.g. renting out your EOS through Chintai, similar to REX) and there are going to be so many dApps where you can hodl your EOS but still make ""qualifying transactions"" that you literally need to be living under a rock or in a coma for this to impact you. No joke. This is not like Bitcoin where you have to make a Bitcoin transfer, pay fees, etc. This is just you interacting with websites that are underpinned by the blockchain... you pay no fees, you lose no EOS, you keep hodling for as long as you like, etc. Anyway, not going to affect you. Guaranteed.

Regarding the vote buying scandal, it might or might not be happening (currently only alleged), and even if it is, it doesn't necessarily mean there will be a negative impact on the blockchain performance, and if at any point it does, I believe the arbitration system will take care of it. I have nothing to back this up. This is mere speculation. I admit that (funnily, uncertainty about the future is not something that the naysayers are willing to admit when they pronounce the death of this chain...). Anyway, admitting that I don't know what's going to happen, I do know how this blockchain is built, and arbitration is going to help in the collusion case. If it doesn't, then it's likely because it doesn't work at all, in which case EOS is screwed for multiple other reasons.

Remember, the chain is 4 months old. You're buying in at <$6 because there's a lot of maturing that still needs to happen. ",18-10-21-23-31,3,141,besthingsinliferfree,9q35n4
10091,"People are already HODLing on the exchanges-- the majority are already doing that anyhow; you don't need an actual EOS account to HODL.  Most people are lazy and keep it all on the exchanges so they can quickly trade or liquidate to fiat pronto.

Regarding the vote-- informed voting is the only hope for long-term DPOS/EOS success.  Voting is easy to do now, especially when using an informed vote proxy.  A good proxy has performed the BP research, allowing stakeholders to choose a proxy that will vote their stake.

I guess we will also see some standardization in this area too.

The biggest differentiator for Stellar is that Stellar allows you to create “assets” which I’ve never really got fully appreciated because I haven’t seen it applied in reall life. Assets are representations of real life things like commodities , fiat money, or crypto currency. 

Stellar has been low profile which is why it’s been hovering at the bottom of the top ten. But it has been building a sturdy base and is partnered with IBM.

There were powerpoint slides comparing Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stellar side by side. I think this was back in 2013 or 2014. The internal scripting in Bitcoin is quite tedious in comparison to how it can be handled in many newer projects, but smart contracts did I fact originate with Bitcoin and not Ethereum... It is more difficult, but doable. The programming in Bitcoin requires you to be a better programmer you might say. But I'd still say that the route of EOS, with a design that takes WebAssembly into consideration from the very genesis, offers considerable advantages. By now, I'm sure Stellar can also use other languages for scripting... But script what? Ethereum and the like can only handle simplistic use cases... They cannot make a twitter on that blockchain... They cannot handle in-game MMORPG economies. Any sort of attempt at doing so quickly runs into limits. If you program your decentralized solution on Ethereum instead of EOS, you risk endangering your project simply because it won't scale for future needs.

",18-06-05-07-20,1,21,KajinBaban,8ol1zb
10486,You are buying an IOU for the real EOS and will be sending to an EOS wallet when the main net is officially live.  You will be able to tell the difference based on what wallet will receive it.  You won't be able to send it to an ETH address anymore just like you can't send to BTC to an ETH address since they are different.  Then EOS will have it's own type of token for ICOs / Airdrops similar to how ETH has ERC20. ,18-06-05-07-20,1,189,Gelvandorf,8ol1zb
10487,No a utility token doesn’t even need to have a price. But someone will need to stake EOS to use the utility token because each transaction requires bandwidth. ,18-06-05-04-31,2,573,cognitivesimulance,8ojnrd
10488,"I guess the dApp developer puts in the stake, right. The users use the dApp for free. Seems you have to charge for your dApp to earn your payroll and cover your bandwidth expenses then, unless you do an airdrop. ",18-06-05-04-31,2,51,CryptoDApper,8ojnrd
10489,Generally I think most dapp devs will probably put in a stake but for some apps like a decentralized Dropbox I would expect users to stake.,18-06-05-04-31,2,573,cognitivesimulance,8ojnrd
10490,"If users would stake they must have EOS wallet I guess, which would mean less users for your dApp (at least atm). Would be good that users not even knowing it was a dApp their are using.",18-06-05-04-31,1,51,CryptoDApper,8ojnrd

Even if some crypto project ""airdropped"" perfectly to every individual human being equally, over time it would accumulate again. The only way to have equality in a trade system is by constantly regenerating -- ""airdropping"" -- capital to every person, i.e. implementing Basic Income to augment Trade.

PoS is no different from PoW. The only difference is that with PoW the capital centralization mechanism is exogenous to the system. In PoS, those with tokens get tokens. In PoW, those with ""real-money tokens,"" i.e. the huge mining farms and the US-dollar means to pay for all the equipment and the ensuing power bills, end up with all the tokens.

If a token is trade-able and desirable, it's going to be accumulated by those who have the capital, in whatever form. This ""POS / DPoS is economically centralized"" is pure nonsense.",18-05-20-21-40,2,124,fcecin,8ks3ro

This combined with a insurance system whereby the loan payee will pay a premium on top of the monthly repayment to ensure the risk of default.

In a capitalistic society that means providing investor education and capital. Note that capital is not the same as free money.

Any interpretation of basic economic theory would state there’s no trick that will get EOS around this fact.

The only reason progressive taxes works is that it’s an involuntary system.

You don't actually *own* the ERC-20s you have on the exchange, and this appears to be a loophole. Yes, those US/China people will see their exchange accounts updated from ERC-20s to new-EOS too.

If you withdraw those ERC-20 tokens to your own private ETH address, that's when you become the owner. 

In theory (someone'll correct me if I'm wrong!) a US user, banned from having participated in the ICO, can simply wait until their exchange-held EOS ERC-20s have been swapped for the new EOS-coin and then transfer that new EOS-coin to a private address on the new EOS-chain, because at that point 'EOS' is no longer an ICO asset.

EOS as a concept is 'Ethereum 2.0' - they wanted to make a faster, more accessible, more functional and more decentralised DApp platform which would be suitable for the modern business environment.

The platform is also backed by a massive fund, which will hopefully allow projects to be funded without the need of pre-sales, and could result in holders of EOS being airdropped tokens. Even if it doesn't, then the fund should allow for the best projects to be developed on the platform, driving demand for the token.

In EOS, the dapp developers pay the fees through token inflation. Users can make transactions and interact with dapps for free - they dont even need to know anything about blockchain or cryptocurrency. They can use a dapp just like they use any other other website. Very usable. Since the developer pays the fee instead of the user, they can figure out how to pay monetize their apps however they want. With ads for example.

10680,You might find some good answers in the [FAQ I created](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/88585f/the_exhaustive_eos_faq/). ,18-04-09-00-36,4,51,Techno-Tech,8aqar7
10681,"The number 1 and number 3 most used blockchains(in terms of tx per day) are made by our main man Dan Larimer. http://www.blocktivity.info/ I believe in a couple of months, it will be #1 EOS, #2 STEEM and #3Eth, but I am happy to be proven wrong. 
Every blockchain above EOS in market cap has major flaws. Ethereum is great but can't scale for another year or 2 so it's out for now. Everything else can't scale and don't have anywhere near the features that EOS does. The flaw in crypto in general is that is has only solved a handful of use-cases : currency, ""store of value"" (though this was only mentioned when they realised that it can't be used as currency anymore due to scaling), ICO's, and gaming to name a few. Smart contracts promise to greatly increase these usecases but can't at the moment due to scaling. As smart contracts are part of blockchain v2- chains that don't have sc's are like html with no javascript. This leaves EOS, ETH, Cardano, NEO, NEM? LISK? (could be more) as projects that could potentially justify the market cap of $266 billion by distrupting existing industries. I hope they all succeed(I think they will because development doesn't happen in a vacuum), though it is my view the EOS will have the right level of decentralisation and usability features to take us all to the next level.
As for the economics, if you accept that is will have broad adoption- how the token works is basically a perfect storm in terms of price rise and appreciation. 
1. People enter the market and stake their tokens to use on the network .
2. If this effect beats the max inflation rate(5%) then scarcity drives the price up, and coorespondingly the profitabiliy of the b.ps goes up.
3 Bps upgrade thier hardware to grab and extra slice of the inflation goodies, which means the tokens you were holding on to a year ago, now command more processing power/storage, increasing value of token and so on.

As you can see there are positive feedback effects here but it all depends on people entering the market and adopting the network- which is where the ~$1.5 billion in VC funding comes in. This is a cash injection to fund projects within EOS, which if the community isn't already super keen to develop (they are), 1.5b is a lot of money and could kickstart this whole thing- all of this will happen in the next couple of months :).

The shill case is that it will be better and bigger than ETH in various ways. I think that's possible. But simply based on transaction volume to market cap ratio now, I think it's undervalued. The ratio hovers around 10:1. BTC is twice that, ETH three times that. So if it becomes valued in that same range later, which it should, then the coins should be easily worth $10-20/each. If it becomes a hyped up coin with a crazy valuation like some others, it could be $50+. That's without any growth in volume. If it does blow up and pass ETH, this could conceivably be a $500+ coin in the next few years.

What do you make of vitalik's criticisms of EOS below. From my understanding he is making all valid points:


[–]vbuterinJust some guy 241 points 8 months ago 
On ""100k transactions per second!!1!1""

Dan's EOS achieves its high scalability by relying on a small number of what are essentially master nodes of a consortium chain, removing Merkle proofs and any other protections that would allow regular users to audit any part of the system's execution unless they want to personally run a full node themselves. See http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/05/08/coordination_problems.html for why I think this is undesirable.

On DPOS

To try to ensure decentralization, DPOS allows all coin holders to vote on who the nodes running the consortium chain are. This, together with the lack of in-protocol economic incentives for these master nodes to behave correctly, and the lack of client-side validation capability, mean that there is an extreme reliance on the voting mechanism. Voting has the following problems:

Low voter participation (the DAO carbonvote, the current EIP186 carbonvote, the DAO proposal votes, and even Bitshares DPOS votes in 2014 all had <10% participation)
Game-theoretic tragedy-of-the-commons vulnerabilities: because each voter only has a tiny chance of influencing the result, their incentive to vote correctly is thousands of times lower than the socially optimal incentive. This means that situations like everyone putting their coins on exchanges and exchanges voting on users' behalf, with users not really caring how exchanges vote with their money, are likely to happen.
Coin holder interests are not perfectly aligned with user interests, and so proposals that increase coin prices at the expense of making the system useful may get implemented.
Basically, those arguing in favor of coin voting are arguing in favor of the same process as the DAO carbonvote deciding who runs the blockchain and all significant protocol decisions.

On fees

EOS has a mechanism where instead of having transaction fees, there is a rule that if you hold N tokens you can send a maximum of N * k transactions per period (see Steem whitepaper). This has quite an undesirable consequence for usability: it means that users have to buy N tokens, and have to be exposed to their volatility. This is especially bad for:

The poor, who are not interested in putting the entirety of their often very low savings into a funky new cryptoasset in order to be able to use a blockchain.
Anyone who wants to use the blockchain only a few times and then go away (they would need to buy coins and then sell them again)
Anyone who experiences prolonged unexpected spikes in demand (ie. pretty much eveyone); users will have to buy enough coins to cover perhaps the 99th percentile of their expected usage, so that they don't get stuck being ""out of gas"" and having to go to an exchange.
In Ethereum the latter is also true to some extent, but because you have to pay fees, the values involved are much smaller, so buying an extra few dollars of ether just in case is not a big deal.",18-04-09-00-36,1,719,etheraider,8aqar7
10774,"lol. now because I do not agree with your point of view I am deemed a troll. I look to educate myself, if Im wrong Im wrong. But continue on patting yourself in the back I guess, dont let me interrupt with thoughtful questions. ",18-04-09-00-36,1,719,etheraider,8aqar7

10777,"On the first point, I believe Vitalik was mistaken. As far as Im aware, EOS has merkle proofs and light clients. Either way I dont think this matters much as all. If you really want to audit everything yourself you can run a full node, but again, I think you can do this with out runing a full node.

On the second point, Vitaliks critisms are totally warrented. Voting for block producers is a design decision that allows for feeless transactions and massive on-chain scalability, but it does not come without trade-offs. The trade offs are that EOS will only have 21 block producers and you can only participate in block production if you are voted in, as opposed to Ethereum where anyone can mine to produce blocks. Obviously it would be better if anyone was able to participate in consensus like they can in Ethereum by mining, but this fundamentally limits the kinds of applications that can be built on Ethereum. Personally, I think the trade offs that EOS has made to get feeless transactions and on-chain scalling are very valuable for certain applications, like the ones I mensioned previously. 

Vitaliks criticism of low voter turnout is a valid criticism, and Im quite worried about this as well. Low voter turnout and uneducated voters can lead to currupt block producers, which is probably the greatest security risk of EOS. I do not think that it is likely for block producers to be currupt, because the coin holders would vote them out and block producers are economically insentivized to not be currupt (they make more money that way) but its an attack vector worth thinking about. I've discussed issues related to voting and this attack in my post, [EOS' Greatest Security Risk is Overpaid Block Producers](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8b457s/eos_largest_security_risk_is_overpaid_block/?utm_source=reddit-android). 

On the part about fees. I think vitalik is missing an important point. *Users of Dapps on EOS do not need to own any EOS at all*. Yes, some EOS coins will need to be staked to allow for a large number of transactions to happen on a certain dapp, but the coins that allocate resources (high tx per sec) to a certain dapp can be owned by the developer, rather than the user.

That said I'll give it a crack. 

Cosmos comes to consensus by the block producers voting on a proposed block from a ""leader"" (the BP that's proposed the block).
This leader is chosen from a round robin algorithm each block round, which is weighted by their voting power. 

It get's more complicated from here. There is an assumption that some % are honest BPs and some are wildcards. They vote on whether to produce the block.

EOS is a DPoS. In the EOS model, everyone votes for the top 20 block producers with one wildcard chosen from a standby pool of 120 runners up. Blocks are produced every .5 seconds cycling through these producers. There is an assumption made that these BPs are producing honest blocks.

As opposed to developing a complicated algorithm to protect against dishonest players, voters can shift votes away from dishonest producers and ask them be penalized for violating the constitution if they're found to be in violation of the communities rules. 

There will be arbitrators that are independent from BPs that will be able to rule on matters raised by the community. This is like how the U.S. govt separates powers between congress and the executive branch.

The success of EOS depends greatly on the ability to keep the arbitrators and the BPs separated and properly incentivized. The BP's incentivized by the money supply and health of the platform for businesses, and the arbitrators incentivized by the community. 

The way this works for Cosmos is that the BPs are allowed to create all rules, and have total control because they have the largest economic incentive to be honest. Any zones created off of the Cosmos central hub are able to create their own rules that are layered onto the Cosmos constitution for use in their own zone. 

There is no proposed way to roll back malicious acts by BPs on the central cosmos hub, though this could be allowed in the zones controlled by other actors off the main hub. 

Cosmos, and EOS are very similar in their aspirations and their differences in their approaches to consensus is super interesting and will be fun to watch how they evolve.

The depth of the retracement is indicitive of the health of the rally. 

If it retraces say 50% - 78%, then it is healthy retracement and uptrend is expected to continue.  If it retraces 90-100%, then the retracement is suspiciously deep, suggesting the selling is too strong at the origin of the retracement (the all time high) and we may enter a range before deciding whether to continue, or for price to turn.  

Regarding EOS specifically, the market is now accumulating at 61% retracement of EOSUSD (origin of the buying at $13 to $18.68, then retracement to current price at $15.25) - i.e. this is very healthy and nothing to worry about.

Universa seems to be going after the digital payment industry where they will have a lot of competitors. EOS is more for development of free dapps for users to use without putting a huge cost on developers to deploy systems with high volume and traffic. Totally different model imo. EOS can still be used to transfer value (without cost), but it serves more than that purpose. On EOS it is also free to store data on the blockchain and free to retrieve it as long as you are in possession of some EOS tokens. Obviously EOS also has some inflation (there is no such thing as a free lunch), but the users wont really feel it, and the developers will be taking a 5% inflation risk per year for holding that EOS, which at such an early stage shouldn't deter them from making their dapps. This 5% will be offset by the growth of the network, imo, so it is not that big of a deal if the project starts getting exponential addoption which would contribute to a large rise in price of those tokens.",17-11-23-18-01,2,0,[deleted],7exua5

The Solution: 
- A massively airdropped EOS alt-chain, distributed over the next 9 months as an ERC20 token, converting to tokens on an EOS alt-chain at the time of EOS launch -~July 2018
- EOS project have declared that they will not be involved in launching a network, only in producing the open-source code.  Responsibility for launching the blockchain lies with the community

11206,"Common fud sponsored by known Ethereum proponents. Some of it is just a flat lie that is as clear as day, like the speed of EOS and not using crytpo pairs. Other claims and accusations do not include all of the information like the decentralization of EOS. Even Eth is essentially just a distributed cloud service. Distribution is the whole point. That prevents double spending and adds trust. Though, you don't need every PC in the world mining in order to achieve this. If you search the related topics you'll find the information you're looking for or you can just look at one of my recent comment that breaks down the decentralisation of Eth and EOS and how it could be easily argued that EOS is capable of more decentralisation than POW crypto like Eth.

It's easy to fool people on this because the structure of POW crypto is pretty black and white. Validators are miners. They get paid to validate transactions through the network. As long as a good number of people mine, the network is safe.  Though, there are multiple weakness and things aren't truly working as they should. EOS has multiple layers of decentralisation through social governance, Voting, feature features that could add voting weight to unique users, 121 validators and even watch dog government bodies that all are designed for a fair and balanced system while targeting high speed, reliability and trust. EOS takes a bit of reading and understanding of crypto, economics and basic human behavior to get a firm grasp of the full picture. It's easy to point to one thing in EOS and say ""That's a bad thing!"" without understanding how everything works together. Read the threads and even my recent post on it.

11208,"I don't think it's the best option. I think larger investors do deserve a larger voice. People can be really dumb and clearly are very susceptible to miss information.

However, I do agree that voting weight should be added to the individual. Large holders have way too much power. When block one adds unique user identification through finger prints and facial recognition (Would be optional and they don't need to connect your finger print to your account. The system just needs to check if you are unique before voting.) They will be able to give bonus votes for each unique user or for the first X number of coins of each unique user. 

For example (numbers are arbitrary. I haven't done the math to pick the best numbers for this shift in voting weight.): Every unique user gets an additional 100 votes or every unique user gets an additional x10 voting power for each coin up until 100 coins. Personally, I'd go with the x10 voting power. 

This allows a leveled playing field. More power to the individual without silencing the big guys. Obviously, this is only possible after we get unique identification. Until then, incentivized voting will help. Only 8% of EOS users vote. Getting paid to vote could turn that number into a majority. That in itself nearly corrects the whole issue but I'm still not sure it would be perfect. Testing would be needed. We should see that feature soon.

I think it will take the same dive because people WILL take profits. I already sold half and immediately put a new buy order at $11 again.

If you bought at below $10 or below $5, of course this doesn't make sense. But some of us didn't get in that early.

11545,"I dont think there is a definitive state of being centralised or decentralised. The level of centralisation is a measure of how many successful block producers there are on the network. Monero for example is more decentralised than Bitcoin because there is a regular change of hash function which prevents large scale production of blocks by asic pools, however it still does not prevent large scale mining using GPUs which is also quite widespread. In cases of both Monero and Bitcoin, nobody has definitive control over industrialised mining which means that any organisation with money can step in and outperform your regular community miner. EOS will have 21 block producers which are paid and the right to produce blocks is controller by voters who stake their coins for a right to vote. What I dont know yet (still trying to learn) is whether this number can change or not for further future scale-ability and how this voting will work exactly. Apart form identifying mining abuse such as front running and others how will we be able to know that a mining entity is abusing the network.

In BTC-like systems, this is not the case. A miner can contribute to the network anonymously, without requiring trust. One consequence of this is, it would be much easier for say a government to force known entities to censor or revert transactions.

I would also make the case, that mining pools are superior to DPOS, wrt decentralization. If the mining pool coordinator behaves badly, miners can always unilaterally leave and form a new pool. In DPOS, to elect new proposers, it requires the current proposers to accept your new voting transaction. So votes can in theory be censored, making it impossible to elect new proposers.

As of right now the proposed cap for BP rewards is 1% of inflation. This is not a proposed cap to inflation itself which is still has a hardcoded cap at 5%. The other 4% would fund worker proposals which could essentially be anything the community thinks is a good idea and approves.

As for how inflation should be chosen and adjusted in general, rates should be set in response to real economic data.

11766,"The answer has multiple parts.

- EOS will constantly be able to upgrade the code to increase efficiency. In the next year we will likely see speeds multiply by many times.

- Rex will unlock a massive amount of CPU power that's not utilized. From what I understand with Dan's messages, the system is being pushed because a good majority of the available CPU is locked away from holders not leasing it. EOS was designed for the resources to be used, not hoarded. Rex intends to fix this.

- Renting resources will become much more common in the future. Rental packages and options will be common place in wallets and sites. Even monthly subscriptions will eventually find their way in. That's a big reason why you're buying EOS now. You're the land owner.

- The biggest point. It's assumed most for profit dapps will soon switch to supplying the resources to their users. Id imagine the first betting dapp that switches to this structure will be widely successful. These dapps will only make more money if their users don't need to be concerned about resources.

- Don't forget. Each transaction on Eth/BTC will run you 40-75 cents. There really is no comparison here. Your 5 EOS may not allow you to sit all day signing transactions at the casino but it's definitely giving you one hell of a bargain. For now, if you want to sit for hours playing games, you'll need to either start renting or at least buy an amount that can more easily sustain your play style. It's not much different than buying a new Xbox one s but at least you can sell it off whenever you want.

- You noted that you are out of CPU don't have enough to rent more but you aren't willing to use free services like CPU emergency that gives you free resources because it's not an emergency? That's what these services are designed for.

- last but not least, check bloks.io for EOS network issues. It's very possible that your being restricted in usage. When EOS is running into issues it can reduce your usage by 1,000x or even more. This has become more common. I believe some bad BP's are making the issue worse but this is one more thing that Rex will help correct.

General problems:

1. EOS mainnet performance is spotty from an end user perspective. Whether it's CPU drain or API endpoint history failure or anything else doesn't matter, what matters is whether it reasonable and reliably works or not.
2. EOS mainnet governance is a clusterfuck that is still unable to make decisions to change anything for the better.",18-11-11-16-47,4,1,eosforumbot,9w1h5v

Now consider ETH and EOS. Eth was the first smart contract platform to be released and gain traction. It was the ""Bitcoin"" of it's niche. EOS is just like all thoese alts in the first wave claiming to replace Bitcoin but failing... the network effect is too strong and no amount of marketing will change that.

Want proof? Look at Bitcoins dominance. There are dozens of coins that are technology superior to Bitcoin with _big_ budgets, yet they don't take off. Thinking that EOS will take off because it can do what ETH did ""but bigger"" is ignoring the reality of the whole crypto market IMO.

If there was a block producer where everyone was in a wheelchair or everyone was deaf, we could tell them they will only get our vote if they fully earn their way like everyone else.  We can say that being a women, being gay, or being black isn't a disability so why help those without disabilities?

The reason isn't because shEOS needs it or we need need to support it.  The reason to support them is because we are so powerful that we already have everything we need and we can support them.  If you don't feel like you have anything extra to give then don't.  Supporting sheOS is for those who think EOS is already far and away an awesome product and we already have awesome BPs.  We have so much abundance, that we can afford to go beyond and support gender diversity and equality.

Men will dominate computers and high tech for the foreseeable future weather shEOS gets the vote or not.  Our vote is only an indication of what we support.  It's OK to ignore gender or other diversity factors and stick to clear business benefits for whoever wants to.

And yes, I would have missed out on numerous rallies in the google stock. But eventually it *has to* pull back to some sort of mean support level. *That*  is a good entry. Profitable traders are successful precisely because of their scrupulousness surrounding trades; being willing to miss out on a big rally so that you can get a more advantageous entry later is quite possibly one of the most difficult skills a trader can possess, and its something that separates great traders from lucky losers. Mathematically, doing what you are talking about is a losing strategy. You might get lucky with google here and there, or maybe you buy in so early you are always in profit, but the next stock you do that to will put you right back in the red. That is a fact.

If this were Omisego, QTUM, Ripple or any other smart coin I would more than likely wait for a pullback before buying, but the upcoming events for EOS seem like major catalysts for price increase. I choose not to wait too long for a dip in fear of having to rejoin again at a much higher price later, and want to secure as much profit possible through high volume in this run-up.

That doesn't make them any less important in the space.  I'm sure not EVERYONE in the late 90's totally believed the internet would be what it is today.

12325,"My post is based on the sticky post in Reddit that says how to register.  So the only ignorance is in the horrible way this swap is handled.  If people need to follow some crazy procedure then first of all the fact that you have to do this should be the highlight when you go to Eos.io and then there should be directions in that highlight.  Instead most people have no clue that they even have to do this and once they do know by accidentally seeing the sticky in reddit the directions are pretty bad and impossible for a US citizen to do.  

EOS is acting like everyone that owns EOS follows their every move and would know.  I’m just not a fan of (timed swaps) in any way.  It’s just totally against my thoughts on crypto personally.  It dignifies the stance of Cryptocurrency is not real money.  Who would ever want to own money or an investment that they have to watch 24/7 or a swap may appear and make thier money worthless when they miss it.  It’s just not logical.  I understand that swaps are important and helpful in many instances, I have no issues with that, but saying you have to magically know about it and do it in a time frame or oh well is the BS part.  Especially since most the time the coin developers or foundation magically claim all the coins that aren’t swapped.  More like a scam IMO at that point.  

What if you put 1million local fiat in the bank and went on vacation to another country for 6 months.  Then when you got back and tried withdrawing your 1 million fiat from the bank they said “oh we burned your money because you missed the deadline to swap the money to a different colored money”.

For the record I have a masters in computer engineering, minor in math and LAN.  I have created 2 of my own coins (not that it’s hard now, but I made mine in 2013, pre scrypt kiddie coins).  Not important coins, just did it to learn.  The point is I have the knowledge and know how to easily register my EOS but it’s not the point that I can.  It’s all the associated disrespect that I perceive with it.  The fact that anyone who doesn’t stumble on the info is robbed.  Eos can’t email or call everyone with the tokens since they don’t have the info but they sure as hell can make it very well known front and center on their website, but they don’t.

P.s registering my eos is as easy as manually setting my IP Vanish to another country or if I had zero clue about computers it would still be super easy to get someone to register my public key for me (I assume it’s just a public key registration, I happily sold my eos 45 minutes ago when it hit .0008 btc and bought act.  For the incoming (good riddance, blah blah posts) you idiots should go buy a clue on economics because your ignorance is stunning.  Your IQ is extremely lacking if in any way you honestly believe your posts that attempt to belittle people is a good thing for your investment.  Will EOS go up? Yes it will.  Is it my loss? No it’s not because I know wtf I’m doing and all the coins I’m invested in will go up, I simply moved my money to another coin that will go up.  Not that it’s my front most ambition anyhow, since even after the coins go up I don’t sell.  Will Eos grow a lot less due to the way things are being handled and the ignorant response in all the threads in /r/Eos? Most definetly!

EOS accounts are 13 char strings,  a human\-readable identifier that is stored on the blockchain. For example @eosauthority, @bob, @mary. As explained in [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions). Account is just account, a name that is required to interact with Blockchain, they do not hold your EOS tokens here, they are just a mask or an avatar if you will, that is owned by your EOS Public key.

`After 3 years of inactivity an` **account** `may be put up for auction and the proceeds distributed to all Members according to the system contract provisions then in effect for such redistribution.`

The Article XV purpose was to discourage cybersquatting, aka people registering thousands of name without any purpose other than holding for a few years then selling it at premium price.

These are the accounts that the Article XV referred to: @coolname, @premium, @rekt, @eternalhodler. Not your EOS token/balance that is owned by your EOS public key. So if you don't use those account for 3 years, it will be put up on auction. And guess what? Your EOS balance will be still in there, and 10 years later you still own that balance (as long as you have access to your private key), you just lose your account of which you can just create another new one by issuing ""cleos create account \<MyNewAccountName\>"" command.

You can't just get someone's EOS without having access to Private key.

I can't imagine how this is even possible anyway when you comprehend the size of EOS given some time. You must have a very limited vision for the potential of EOS to suggest such a thing.

The crypto space is virtually lawless to some extent. The internet became the internet because it was lawless. Our current internet is flawed because of the controlling elite and censorship. EOS must be also lawless to achieve anywhere near its true potential. I know this is a scary thought but you have to trust the process of Anarchy to prove itself.

Let’s use a basic example for an easy review.  EOS is $10, there only exist 10 EOS, 2 are inactive, inflation is 5%, 8 EOS are staked or leased for bandwidth, for $1/year each because they guarantee you 10% of the resources.

So these 8 EOS can enjoy the benefit of up to 25% more bandwidth than the markets should allow, using 100% of resources with only 80% of the allocated EOS.  Inflation is .5 EOS that year.

Now we determine that Joe is inactive and we put his EOS on the market to offset inflation , and three things may happen.  The EOS May stay at $1 rental because each EOS guarantees 10% of system resources, EOS rental may go down to $.80 because that’s what the market built in previously to use 100% of the resources, or more likely some where in between say $.90.

Now the previous owners of the 8 EOS are getting between $6.40 and $8.00.  And the inactive EOS is generating $1.6 to $2, which offsets the inflation of the inactive coins (2Eos * 5% * $10 = $1), and in this basic case may even provide extra funds for worker proposals or to go into an account for Joe if he ever returns.

Taking it off the market temporarily due to inactivity to prevent the inflation problem sounds like a good solution, ie: inactive EOS is not inflated since it's temporarily disabled, but if the owner ever returns it's re-activated and considered part of the market.

What I don't understand with the current proposal is how redistributing that EOS creates less problems for the network, since the inflation will still be there (same EOS in circulation, just re-distributed) and this EOS will now be actively used due to being redistributed to active users, thus consuming CPU cycles on private accounts that, had the EOS been inactive, these CPU cycles would have been publicly available for the entire network for free instead due to their inactivity.",18-06-14-00-32,1,1284,clanleader,8qsvjo

However, a state could not force Ethereum or Bitcoin to shut down an app because there are too many BP's in too many countries, and none of them are known. (They could draft a law to make it illegal and imprison the founders, but no one would care, which is why bittorrent still works.)

""I can read through people’s intent and that isn’t lost because of text.

It appears you are attempting to front run an already well established campaign talking point that EOS 42 and EOS NY \(and ourselves\) has pushed since day one. 

I guess by rehashing it you can position yourself politically around the topic in front of token holders who don’t know any better and include yourself in a list of people who have already been running on a platform of independence. 

Month\(s\) ago, many of us adopted a draft constitution and code of conduct \(even before the final constitution was ready\). You can read all of our statements around these issues in those corresponding posts. 

If you were truly contributing in the spirit of collaboration and not for political gain/positioning you would have taken the time to find that information and exclude us from your public comments regarding these issues. It just looks like you are trying to cast doubt and tear others down to build yourself up. It’s in bad taste and not in the spirit of collaboration that has become the social norms in the EOS ecosystem.

You could have just compiled that list and identified those who had not adopted these principles in a public post, then outreached to those people. That would have been more thoughtful \(and probably more productive\).""",18-06-04-12-04,1,21,edgy_evo,8odohb

He’s released a series of videos to inform people on EOS and in his podcast he and his mate were having a laugh about how much of a crazy bet it was and went into more details about the ins and outs. I wouldn’t say he was misleading people, I feel like you are either taking his comments out of context or being disingenuous yourself.

Also what are the repercussions of him misleading people with this? Did he lie about the tech? Did he lie about his companies financials? Did he lie about anything significant at all? Nope he just made a bit of a fun bet with his mate and shared it with the community using a click bait title.

The more dangerous thing is how people are soo quick to blow things out of proportion and potentially discredit an otherwise honest bp. /r/cryptocurrency has been intentionally spreading misinformation for months about EOS and a lot of it although technically was true (ie a degree of centralisation with 21 nodes) was blown out of proportion and used to smear EOS (ie saying EOS bps would collude to control the network).

12787,"He's technically correct though.  If he wins 1000 EOS at $1000 each, he has won $1MM in a bet.

I'm not sure how much time you've spent around any actual gambling, but it's not uncommon for your winnings and losses to have different values based on the odds, with one party paying out more than the other if a certain condition is met.  In this case the exact winnings and losses are just determined by valuation.  If price hits $900/token he will have lost $900k... which is nearly that $1MM bet you claim he did not make.  To be fair, it could have been made clear, but it's technically accurate and honestly not that big of a deal.

I once dismissed the guy as a complete idiot, but if you watch an interview with him, he's an incredibly intelligent, slightly mad eccentric with wild ideas.

Maverick is a nice fit - he does what he wants, says what he wants without any remorse. He cares not one single fuck what anyone thinks about him, tends to forget (conveniently) what he's said in the past and generally just leaves a wake of chaos behind him.

He's an unapologetic opportunity hunter, skirts around the edge of the law and often breaks it.

Institutional Money:
Big Institutions are not welcome in my paradigm of crypto but I feel they should build private blockchains like b of a and many other corporations have already. To help prevent centralization of wealth and power to repeat I hope emancipation and fractural structures will empower the few over the many. We need 100,000 to 1 million blockchains, many side chains and sister chains to support each. I envision numbers equal to a the neural network of the brain.

Its not, Its the middle ground for a much better balance. 

It has a proper capacity for a distributed network. Its functional and it wasnt kneecapped to prevent it from becoming a danger to the establishment. Now that we know ETH will never have sharding similar to how BTC will never have lightning network. They will keep pushing it back another year every time they get closer with the goal of keeping the coin as centralized as humanly possible. ETH is heavily censored and controlled at this point. You guys absolutely needed casper and plasma to be competitive.

> Also, did you vote for the members of the EACF? No. These members exert control over the BPs as they can freeze transactions writing to the block.

Irrelivant. Pointing something like this is merely an attempt to deflect from the fact that ETHs is a heavily controlled and centralized coin. Which it is.

> Your vote means nothing at this point in time with BO holding 10% of all EOS.

Your vote didn't matter in ETH either when they decided to cut sharding from ever being completed. Enjoy your bags as your coin is officially an ICO indefinitely. Overaly centralized coins like ETH have been literally destroyed by poor governance. And you didnt even have a vote at all.

The scam is EXTREMELY OBVIOUS in the case of ETH. People have made entirely new coins nearly from scratch within the time frame that ETH SUDDENLY needs to fucking get one feature that is probably not even possible. How can you not see that? They are pushing it back.

Yes it is, the end result is censorship and punishes the community for using the coin. Its no different then a central authority whipping you against a wall every time you want to use the coin. Punishing you with shock bracelets every time you want to spend money on something.

That IS a form of censorship.

I intend to, because a coin that does not scale well cannot have a proper distributed network. A proper distributed network is needed for decentrality. If you limit who can use the coin either in a targeted or unintended manner then you have effectively censored that coin and prevented it from being useful to all people who were pushed away.

You cannot achieve decentrality without a proper distributed network.

Sure, but its not within the design parameters. Ram is not designed to stay super expensive, Dan has mentioned tons of things that will bring the price down. Why are you trying to say that's like LITERALLY CHOOSING to kneecap your coin and then push back the solution to that problem years and years away. Its so long away from now that someone can probably just fork ETH and do it themselves faster. But they cant because the new fork would be destroyed by the ethereum core team / corporation. Because it is a centrally owned shitcoin.

No its not! If only 15 fucking people can use coin when their are thousands that want to use it then its not decentralized.

It doesn't matter, if the coin is not capable of supplying its userbase with proper ability to use the platform then it is a coin that is being actively censored by its protocol. This centralizes the userbase of the coin making it so only a very few people are able to even use it. Its a mechanism, either intentionally or unintentionally implemented to prevent a full distributed network.

If I cant effectively buy a cup of coffee with a coin then that coin is designed to prevent me from use cryptocurrency in this manner. It doesn't matter if it is a government entity or just a desire to curtail censorship on some other level.

So, I've read many comments in this thread and think both sides have valid points:

Of course with its huge head start, Ethereum has a wealth of readily-available resources for fledgling Solidity developers, and EOS has a lot to catch up in that regard but it will improve quickly. On the other hand, with Casper, Plasma etc (plus perhaps something else we don't know yet), I'm fairly certain that the large pool of talented Ethereum developers will eventually achieve much improved level of scalability that may well rival that of EOS.

I just hope we can stop unproductive EOS vs. Ethereum debate that veers off discussing objective technical merits and instead degenerates into name-calling matches. Why not cheer for both projects to succeed? I'm sure there will be enough investment money and also actual DApp applications that can sustain both platforms (plus many more, perhaps on a smaller scale than these  two).",18-04-25-07-30,1,576,ypp192,8eo5e3

Once you commit to a language it becomes very hard and time consuming to change. Smart contracts written in c/c++ will mostly remain in c/c++.

Larimer hasn’t substantiated a single claim he has made. All you have to go on is his word. Sure you could look at the GitHub but unless you’ve contributed pull requests to their repo you probably don’t really understand how it works under the hood or if it is actually even secure.

Therein lies the problem not just with EOS but most crypto projects. Lots of promises with no substance or proof of any of the claims.  In addition the more complex a project, the more likely it is to have issues and the more important it becomes to provide proven assurances.  EOS is complex.  Words in a white paper are just not enough. 

I accept I could be wrong.  But I’ve lived long enough to know people are often full of bullshit and will do or say anything for a quick buck. So unless there are actual audits and proofs of the claims eos makes, I cannot in all sincerity just believe what they say. 

And the fact they are selling as a c++ smart contract platform to me speaks volumes about their attitude towards security or your investments.

Which is completely undocumented anywhere on EOS's website. So far, the only methods available to do that require to either trust a third party tool that hasn't been endorsed officially by EOS, clone the eosjs-ecc and goof around with some nodejs, or build and run the beta genesis key generation tool that hasn't even been tested on Linux. Either way, this is as far as can be from a sound, well documented, and user friendly process. After all these years of evolution of crypto systems, I find EOS launch process to be seriously lacking in many important areas. For a project this well funded, this is quite a let down.

13741,"Hey man, thanks a lot for this post. #1 is just a temporary hiccup & I would not worry. However, I really want to address #2.

The reason why most projects are using the genesis snapshot, is that it's easy. You can download genesis.json, make a 5 minute script, and start pushing out tokens to everyone's account. You can do an airdrop start-to-finish in a few hours.

If you want to do a ""block 3,000,000"" snapshot, things are more tricky. Currently, you will need to create a script to parse each block from 0-3,000,000 looking for token transfers, and update an internal db, which is initialized with the genesis snapshot. This takes awhile, and is harder to code up.

HOWEVER, we cannot use the genesis snapshot forever. 1 year from now, airdropping according to the genesis snapshot would be a joke. Since this is going to be a highly necessary thing (being able to run snapshots) we (as EOS developers and block producers) should get together and make an easy open source script to push out snapshots, given any block.

My concern is that I have seen launch issues persist in blockchain projects for years. For example, Dash had an accidental premine at launch that people still mention years later. It has been a factor in some forks. Similar issues exist in other blockchains. My preference is to err on the side of caution at launch. Especially when the additional time required is on the scale of 12-24 hours. The recently noted issue 3918 has not been tested. Dan's explanation seems to make sense but it is untested.

13923,"Experimental physics grad here - current QCs do not (and probably cannot) output perfect binary results. Rather they output a range of results that are very close to the real answer. This is because you apply an electromagnetic field with the encoded question across the qubits and then you record the output photons which by the uncertainty principle has inherent uncertainties. Many current architectures will repeat the same question several times and take an average result of the output answers. This means that QCs are very good for problems like machine learning where you want to optimize the weights and bias which are not deterministic but good approximations.

QCs will likely be orders of magnitude better at brute forcing crypto protocols but they will never be perfect and are likely a little over hyped atm. Long term, they definitely could pose problems to current crypto-architectures. ",17-11-22-03-22,5,759,LukeSkyWalkerGetsIt,7eizym

13927,"My gut feeling form current REAL QCs (as opposed to the perfect hypothetical models from theory) is that they wont scale in a way that would allow hash code decryption - one scaling problem they have is that you will need to repeat measurements many times which scales with the number of qubits (we would like a linear scaling but that's not really what we are seeing atm). Additionally, there currently isn't any known algorithms for QCs to actually decrypt hash functions. If it is possible, I can't see it happening within the next 10/15 years... I could be wrong. 

The question is discussed more here: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/44386/are-cryptographic-hash-functions-quantum-secure",17-11-22-03-22,2,759,LukeSkyWalkerGetsIt,7eizym
13928,TL:DR: IMO QCs will only scales to a few orders of magnitude better than classical computers. This isn't enough scaling to brute force hash codes. ,17-11-22-03-22,2,759,LukeSkyWalkerGetsIt,7eizym
13929,"In semiconductor physics (ie. the physics behind transistors and processors for computing) transistors as grown using really cleaver techniques on a perfect silicon crystal wafer - this stuff is supposed to be atomic scale perfect but often due to the difficulties of manufacturing errors and defects are grown into the crystal - not enough errors to render the chip useless but enough to downgrade an i7 to an i5 or maybe you will have to shut down a full core or two. 

Quantum computers try to entangle a bunch of single atom qubits. This stuff needs to be atomic scale perfect AND needs to be in a non-interacting environment - ie. close to absolute 0 temperature, no noise, no em fields, nothing but the input signal you want to process. So its a really challenging engineering problem but assuming you have all that sorted... qubits will still always be limited by the uncertainty principle so I don't think they will be good for this type of problem. I think they will be REALLY good at machine learning though. ",17-11-22-03-22,1,759,LukeSkyWalkerGetsIt,7eizym

I will keep both EOS and BTC and hopefully one day they go back and exceed their ATH. ,18-06-18-00-10,2,244,jasonvoorhees-13,8rr9fn

If network can't support some bandwidth level of transactions, reduce cap below it, there's no circumstance at which it should fail.

Nobody can spam consistently past their allocation of bandwidth.
