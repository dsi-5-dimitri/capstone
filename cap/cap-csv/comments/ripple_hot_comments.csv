I wrote this guide because I had to find out by myself and found it incredibly difficult first time. I hope this helps for all wondering how to buy ripple at the minute.

PLEASE NOTE: You can sign up to sites that allow the immediate purchase of Ripple, such as Bitstamp, or Kraken, but the waiting list is long and the sites often crash (from my own experience).
This is not necessarily the perfect way to purchase, but at the minute I find it to be the most reliable way.

In order for this process to work you need two separate accounts on two separate websites. These websites are Binance.com (a crypto currency exchange) and Coinbase.com (the biggest website for crypto currency purchases). Once you have made an account on both, you will also need to provide verification information on Coinbase. This typically takes 1-24 hours to clear depending on how busy the site is.

You will also want to download an app to you phone called Google Authenticator – which you will require in order to log into Binance, as it will offer procedurally generated six digit codes in order for you to log in each time. You will know when to use this because Binance will request that you scan a QR Code.

This process below details how to purchase a crypto currency called Ethereum, on Coinbase. Once you have this crypto currency, you are then able to transfer it across to a live exchange, Binance. From here, you will then exchange your value in Ethereum, for Ripple. You can do this same process with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin, from Coinbase. However it is far cheaper to transfer Ethereum, and so you are able to convert it into more Ripple.
I hope that this guide helps.

Good luck and my your investments make you happy.
These instructions apply once you have verified your account on Coinbase and set up 2FA on Binance (scanned the QR Code with Google Authenticator).

1.	Log into Coinbase.
2.	Click Buy/Sell (Top left hand Corner).
3.	Click Ethereum. Select the amount you wish to purchase.
4.	Click Buy now.
5.	Leave Coinbase open. Open a second tab on your PC and log into Binance.
6.	At this stage, remember to use the Google Authenticator App for your 6 digit code.
7.	On Binance click funds (top right hand corner) and then Deposits / Withdrawals.
8.	Search for “ETH” on the left hand side.
9.	When Ethereum pops up, select “deposit”. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CLICK ON ETHEREUM AND NO OTHER COIN. IF YOU SEND YOUR COINBASE VALUE TO THE WRONG CURRENCY YOU MAY LOSE YOUR MONEY.
10.	Copy your unique “ETH Deposit Address”.
11.	Return to Coinbase on the tab you left open. Leave the tab open for Binance
12.	Click “Accounts” on the top of your screen.
13.	Go to Ethereum, and click send, providing that your initial purchase has gone through.
14.	Paste your “ETH Deposit Address” and click send.
15.	Your Ethereum will now be sent to Binance.
16.	You will receive an email when your Ethereum has arrived at Binance. This can take up to half an hour (from experience) so please do not panic.
17.	On Binance, once your Ethereum is there, hover over “Exchange” (top left) and then select ""basic"".
18.	On the exchange, make sure that “ETH” is highlighted on the top right. This is next to “BTC” and “BNB”.
19.	In the search bar,, once you have selected ""ETH"" type “XRP” and then click on “XRP/ETH”.
20.	Scroll to where it says “Buy XRP”, click “Market” and “100%”.
21.	Click “Buy XRP” and you have Ripple.
22.	You can check its value by going back to ""funds"" and then ""withdrawal deposit"" - in the top right hand corner.

Because transactions are fast and XRP is used as a medium between other currencies e.g. USD and GBP, the number of XRP used in the middle is irrelevant. E.g. If MoneyGram transfers $100 USD to somewhere ending up as £74 GBP, they won’t really care if in the middle is 50XRP or 2XRP or 0.1XRP.

The current minimum reserve requirement is 20 XRP. (This is the cost of an address that owns no other objects in the ledger.)",17-12-21-23-23,1,8,UmmeedSinha,7l94ng
178,"Hey good luck. The very first thing is to read about the technology of the coin in which you are investing. You need to buy any altcoin or bitcoin and send it to exchange websites like binance.com / Bittrex/ Poloniex etc. After recieving it you can convert it to the desired coin you want.

Since you are a student, keep in mind:
1. Invest only which you can afford to lose.
2. Buy or Sell in pieces and not all in once.

241,"Did you do your homework?
XRP works better the higher the value.
You can do internation remittance of 5 trillion a day better with a higher value as when it is $100,- as when it it worth $0.10 as you will have to use less.
Let me put it in perspective:
There is about 14 XRP for every person on earth of which 55% is placed in escrow and 6% is in the ownership of Ripple employees. 
So that makes about 6 (to count easy) for every person on earth.
Mojaloop wants to help the unbankef people to be their own bank so they can save money and get out of poverty. 
These are 2.8 billion people.
Than you have remittance companies, banks and people like me who have some XRP.
That is not much of an XRP available even when there is just over 39 billion in the market or 39% in the market at the moment.
The higher the price the more liquid it becomes and the better it works as the fees still will be 10 drops or one millionth of a cent to get burned/fees.

It will make a $10,- product made in Africa available for the global market.
Which is now not useable due to the high fees of PayPal etc.

So these poor people can now sell their stuff, be their own bank and save money to get out of poverty (Mojaloop.io).

If banks wants to send 5 trillion a day in 250 business days as it is now (XRP will make it 365 24/7 but I just don't want to do the math as it is not useful for this example).
So banks want to move 5 trillion with 39 billion  on the market. That is just not possible even when they have all XRP and a price of $10,-.

So there will be the store of value due to the costs savings banks and retailers like The AsiaMTM Group.
And I know a few other household names which will adopt XRP as a payment for their services. 

When you count all that in, a low price just can't send even 100 million in global remittance.

I know some more day to day uses where it can cut costs but I can't say them yet. So don't believe me on this.

If you take all these factors in account and when instand payments are applied the 27 trillion locked up in Nostro and Vostro accounts will gfet freedup so the banks can use that money to loan it to businesses and other people to gain more profit. 

It is not hard to see that it need a higher price as a bridging currency.

The part xCurrent does is created a demand for a XRP-fiat pairing where that isn't possible now. 
The more partners xCurrent are going to use the more demand there will be to get a fiat pairing and a aditional 27% costs savings bybthe banks. At least that is what Ripple states. Cuallix has another number as the 60% costs savings that they gain with XRP. (In the 60% is the 27% if XRP usage already included).

So instead of telling me to do my homework. I suggest you should Google what numbers Cuallix has announced of costs savings. 

And when you did that we can always talk again. It is not hard to Google takes about 30 minutes including reading time. 

So you go read and let us talk afterwards when you knoe how big the global remittance is, take in account retailers who accept XRP.
The 2.8 billion people of Mojaloop.io.
And the rest of the world like you and me who take a cab or rent a apartment somewhere to spend our vacation.

And tell me what it has to be worth before you can effectively use it.
And when you read think about the Jevons Paradox in this case too as it will be a good example of what is about to become reality.

Before years end you will see what I mean. And it is only starting, do the bridging currency needs a high store of value to be used even when it takes just 5% of global remittance.
But it will grow way beyond what ever you think is possible and my guess is a lot higher as $1000,- in 10 years even.

Due to all possibilities it has besides bridging or the Smart Contracts in Codius. 

Just look what the experience of Cuallix is, the global remittance amount, the Nostro/Vostro accounts, Jevons Paradox and Mojaloop.io.

Look into this as those are only the start of where it will be used for.

Anf shall we agree to discuss after you looked into these topics and experiences.

Maybe look in what corridors xCurrent is going to make as it is designed for fiat pairings driven demand all over the globe where it is not yet possible to use XRP due to the lack of pairing in a currency. 

I hope to read your answer when you looked into these few topics I just addressed.

I will await your reaction, looking forward to what your response is.

Sometimes I feel like I’m living in a bubble because I track developments w  the XRP ecosystem and RippleNet 10x more than my other holdings - Yes it represents the majority of my bags - but I still just don’t see another crypto with such a coordinated group effort across the board - from Ripple themselves, to SBI, Coil, R3, Weitze, etc - towards actually making adoption a reality.  Other cryptos have updates and news sure, but it mainly feels like hot air and Rah rahs to pump the coin, wait for the next bull run, etc - nothing really legitimate to show me serious growth potential - at least not in the level of XRP and Ripple.

But then I stop myself and wonder - if I was focused to the same level on something like EOS or ETH instead for example - are they pressing their platforms forward with the same level of resilience and determination?  Do they have the same level of pedigree amongst their development teams?

Strictly from a business standpoint, is this ecosystem progressing or not?  IMO, in many ways you could  actually say it’s accelerating.  During the same bear market that has you all bummed out.  If the tech sucked, it wouldn’t still be growing, would it?  People would probs be cancelling services, wouldn’t they?  Former customers would be talking shit about how RippleNet didn’t help them and it’s a scam and what a waste of money, right?  Have they?  No.

477,"Super clear instruction, very nice! I have two general questions about Coil, hope you can help me get this straight: 

1. Do you need to have the chrome extension in order to be able to see if a website is monetized? For example, I cannot see anything on your own website [consistentme.com](https://consistentme.com)
2. The money that is being transmitted towards the monetized websites comes from those who are subscripted ($5,- pm) right? So the combination of visitors on your website, number of monetized websites and the number of subscripted people decide how much your page 'is earning'? 

I still find it a bit difficult to get my head around Coil and why people like myself would pay $5 per month. Not sure what I would get in return for that $5 besides possibly add-free websites? 

Thanks!",19-02-22-20-17,1,28,BlokyNL,atffp5

But as long as you can edit theme code or add plugins, there is a way to install Coil!

I got feedback on my article which I will update tomorrow, this plugin seems to be the most up-to-date choice when using a plugin for now! 😊

https://thedmlab.com/blog/coil-payments-wordpress-plugin-xrp/",19-02-22-20-17,2,121,consistentbenny,atffp5
481,"1. With the Coil or Firefox extension you see it right away, yes. Another would be to check the page with the [Coil Checker](https://fudbingo.com/coilchecker).
2. Yes, so every Coil subscriber pays a monthly rate of 5$ right now. This allows Coil to donate to content creators. I believe at this point, while in development. How it adds up behind the scenes, like if exactly the amount coming in per month is also going out, I don't know. I believe Coil has great support from Ripple and they just have a pool of XRP which they can use.

To your general question - you basically answered the question already.

Imagine the internet without having to watch ads on every page you visit (or having to use an ad-blocker to make it bearable to use). Coil's real-time payments could either allow a website to reduce or completely get rid of ads, which they are now dependent on, because today the internet is basically only monetized through ads.A website could also have ads for free users, but could deactivate them for Coil users. Or have special content which you need to be a Coil subscriber for to see it.

It could be like everyone's Netflix or Spotify subscription. I imagine people to also have a Coil subscription of 10$, but obviously it will take time for a critical mass of people to understand why they should pay something at all for content on the internet. The internet is perceived as a free good, but people forget that ads are everywhere, they track & follow you, always trying to get your attention over and over again to buy stuff. I personally would not use many websites anymore if I did not use an adblocker. But many people don't.

Also, I believe that this might come top-down from content creators to their followers. For a content creator, having to use ads to make a living sucks, because it just feels like you have to sell something to your followers (passively through third-party ads) even though you just want to share your content with them. But a content creator needs to eat too. Every blog post or YouTube video is work.

So once some creators move over to getting rid of ads, explaining to their followers why instant micro-donations are a much better way for them to deliver their content clean and distraction-free, loyal followers will actually follow.

With Twitch and YouTube streams you can already see that many people are willing to pay for consuming ad-free content. Over time I do believe this will spread out to all other sorts of digital content too.",19-02-22-20-17,1,121,consistentbenny,atffp5

I've never quite understood how this works in practice. Presumably if you run a validating node, it's just validating transactions by itself, and unless another validator explicitly chooses to trust your validator, doesn't that mean you're just out on a limb, screaming into the darkness and it doesn't matter what transactions you claim are valid because no-one trusts you?

So all validators have to be connected together in a web, and if you're not connected to that web, or you form your own closed circuit separate from that web, ultimately no-one else will care?

The peer-to-peer XRP Ledger network consists of many independent XRP Ledger servers (typically running rippled) that accept and process transactions. Client applications sign and send transactions to XRP Ledger servers, which relay these candidate transactions throughout the network for processing. Examples of client applications include mobile and web wallets, gateways to financial institutions, and electronic trading platforms.

Does this mean that Rippled servers are the first stop for most applications. ",19-02-22-11-38,1,11866,charklar,atastd
637,"Validators aren't really validating transactions. They aren't creating blocks... The XRPL is a mesh network. Every validator sees every transaction. Validators are more like sequencers, who order transactions that apply to all protocol rules( transactions are validated by protocol rules). Perfect transactions are always added to the consensus round, the UNL is only used for edge cases honest participants can disagree on( IE a double spend attempt). It doesn't really matter how a DS is resolved, just that it cant happen( since both transactions in a DS are valid it doesn't really matter which one is chosen, just that one is)

You don't have to be on others UNLs to still be functioning within the network. For example, as a validator if you are not on any UNLs, you can still do everything any validator does, like submit a transaction. That transaction will be included in consensus, if it follows the protocol rules. The purpose of running a validator is to be able to rely on your own node to submit transactions.
 
Side note: They don't have to trust the validators on their UNL individually, They are trusting that as a whole the UNL they chose is a diverse enough to where validators couldn't collude in unison because if they did then the validator listening to them could fall out of sync with the main chain....",19-02-22-11-38,2,3455,mikenard77,atastd

We know that RippleNet can provide liquidity to illiquid pairs, for instance if no one wants to trade Dinars for GBP but you could buy USD with Dinars and then buy GBP with those USD. You bought all of the available GBP for sale for Dinars already, if any existed, or so many that the exchange rate for that pair is no longer favorable.

RippleNet automatically chooses these paths. If you want to buy BTC with USD, using RippleNet you now have access to not just the USD/BTC pair but to every pathway from USD/X into X/BTC.

XLM was routinely pumped by the founder Jed McCaleb, he sold 0.5-1.5% of daily XRP volume to fund his purchases of XLM, and he did so for years (he had 9 Billion XRP and now he ""only"" has 4.68 Billion left). That is why XLM always rose a few hours/days after XRP did. For unknown reasons he stopped selling XRP January 11, even though he had sold 1-3 Million XRP daily for years. The only transactions he has been doing from his 4.68 Billion XRP account lately is to tip people in XRP every now and then: [https://bithomp.com/explorer/rDbWJ9C7uExThZYAwV8m6LsZ5YSX3sa6US](https://bithomp.com/explorer/rDbWJ9C7uExThZYAwV8m6LsZ5YSX3sa6US)

I don't know if he stopped believing in the XLM project or if he knows something we don't? He may have come to some sort of new agreement/cooperation with Ripple again?

Of course we all know the stake and influence of SBI over R3. Not to mention R3 and Ripple working together now as well as before the lawsuit. It makes sense that R3 would utilize XRP moreso than something else.

However, I'm not assuming anything. We all know what that creates. This will be an interesting project to follow. Instant Property Network is beginning an alpha trial period. They are trying to tackle streamlining the transaction of property, a $217tn market.

### Tencent embraces Ripple currency

The most effective thing a company of Tencent’s size and scale can do for the development of digital currency is to infuse some capital into various platforms. Tencent recently threw its support behind the Ripple payment protocol, pledging $2 billion [to the project](https://oracletimes.com/tencent-to-pump-2-billion-into-ripple-xrp-and-more-banks-are-in/) in March 2018. Over the course of the next year, Tencent will convert that $2 billion into Ripple cryptocurrency to be used across different applications within the Tencent ecosystem.

Ripple is an especially attractive digital payment protocol for banks and other financial institutions due to the fact that transactions are fast, relatively inexpensive to process and highly secure thanks to blockchain technology. By both providing monetary support to the currency and incorporating it into popular platforms like WeChat and QQ, Tencent has given Ripple the best chance possible to catch on with users in China.

Blockchain technology requires a great deal of computing power to operate, and Tencent Cloud can provide all the resources needed to maintain ideal performance and uptime levels. BaaS solutions like TrustSQL will continue to grow in demand, and Tencent Cloud solutions help organizations develop their own tools and integrate them into popular applications.",19-02-18-15-04,1,7,cryptojan,art0r8

1. Sell 50 XRP at 30c
2. Sell 20 XRP at 30c
3. Order execution: sold 30 XRP at 30c

Between step 1 and 2 the order representing 30 XRP was reserved in the book, and then step 3 shows that an order for those 30 XRP has now been processed, but with there only being 20 XRP in the book, it's clear that that 30 XRP order was a reserved one.

### Tencent embraces Ripple currency

The most effective thing a company of  Tencent’s size and scale can do for the development of digital currency  is to infuse some capital into various platforms. **Tencent recently  threw its support behind the Ripple payment protocol, pledging $2  billion** [**to the project**](https://oracletimes.com/tencent-to-pump-2-billion-into-ripple-xrp-and-more-banks-are-in/)  **in March 2018. Over the course of the next year, Tencent will convert  that $2 billion into Ripple cryptocurrency to be used across different  applications within the Tencent ecosystem.**

Ripple is an especially attractive  digital payment protocol for banks and other financial institutions due  to the fact that transactions are fast, relatively inexpensive to  process and highly secure thanks to blockchain technology. **By both  providing monetary support to the currency and incorporating it into  popular platforms like WeChat and QQ, Tencent has given Ripple the best  chance possible to catch on with users in China.**

I can't see a future where the top 5 banks (1-4 china, 5 UK) in the world roll over and let JPM, #6, take control of crypto, thether it to the USD and become the global banking superpower. Interestingly enough, the remaining top 10 ten banks are 2 French, 1 Japanese and The Bank of America, who would be direct rivals to JPM and again extremely unlikely to use their JPMcoin.

I first scoffed at his explanation as though Swift was all poweful, but then I realized Swift and legacy banking can never take risky moves due to regulation and shareholder sentiment. But ALL of the smaller banks and credit unions sure can. Which will put the Larger banks (like Deutsche bank mentioned) out of profit on FX fees.  

I thought it interesting, there’s absolutely still a chance for ripple! I love that he eventually left SWIFT and began working at Ledger in institutional custody security :). At the very least, Xpring will help XRP use cases, earthport, sendfriend, SBI... all is not lost if they collude against Ripple because we have XRP Ledger which is separate and that’s (thankfully) what our coins are on.

Banks are not going to drive up the price of cryptos, regular people are. The next big cryptocurrency is going to be the one perceived to be the most legitimate by casual onlookers, and if they see that banks are using XRP to handle their multibillion dollar payments instantly and cheaper than the alternatives, that’s the one people will flock to.

I still feel we have a long way to go from the perspective of the fiat value of XRP, but I think we are heading in the right direction.

1852,JPM coin is DLT and this was inevitable and the whole banking industry is in disruption. This is a bullish signal for xrp and crypto as a whole.

I think you aren't seeing the bigger picture here. XRP is  to be used to make settlement at the consumer level nearly instant with low fees. What JPM is doing is something similar and internal. Basically an IOU to internal (potentially external) transfers. This would result in the same thing where at the consumer level they would receive their funds immediately.

That's my understanding of it anyways. It seems like it will lessen the demand for XRP because of this. However, I think that the fact that JPM is doing this only validates the industry demand for an XRP-like solution. And of course XRP is likely a MUCH better solution as well.

To answer your question, as I mentioned previously, JPM's reputation is in the crosshair with the silver market fiasco. The only way I see other banks using their coin is if they blackmail them to do it. No bank will use another bank's asset especially considering its an IOU and that's a huge counter party risk.

Here’s the truth that a lot of crypto people who have zero experience in finance and banking - these banks like JPM are just going to copy models like ripple and use the technology for their own gain. There is no revolution unless there is a mass economic collapse of world ending proportions. It’s not happening. Fear is stirred in media for clicks but it’s just not reality. Banks like JPM in 5-10 years are going to be largely software engineers who are maintaining and creating all the technologies that Ripple creates - they already are 25% - 30% SE's today. Bitcoin is centralized in China because guess what - they think they can undermine control of the new economy through ownership of bitcoin.

Ripple is especially dead because simply its only selling point was for absolute autonomy of cross-border payments and transactions instant settlement of trades for banks.

And who is GS, MS, BOA, and the rest going to trust more JPM or Ripple.. hint hint its JPM.

So I have criticism for all crypto but XRP especially appears to have no legs for future adoption. I guess we'll see but people on this subreddit (maybe not you exclusively) have no scope of how the financial system really works.  There are hundreds of thousands of software engineers behind each one of these big banks maintaining and innovating the infrastructure that keeps them relevant in the modern economy.

1976,"You have good pints but some are not accurate and definitely overstated. For starters it would not cost J.P. Morgan “billions” to utilize Ripples technology I don’t even know where you would get such an idea. On the contrary any banks utilization of XRP through Ripples XRapid technology saves them quite a bit of money. It’s the opposite of what you stated. Furthermore, although banks do employ software engineers to a degree, they do not have hundreds of them on staff modernizing their technology. The fact that they still utilize old-school Swift proves that point. Additionally, XRP is already being used by banks and credit unions and developing fintech which just disproves the statement that XRP doesn’t have any legs.  I have to say we are getting to a weird point in this conversation because you’re repeating FUD that has been disproven several times.

When I read what you write I can tell that you’re falling into the trap of assuming that all of these banks are going to get along and agree with each other as they develop their own bank coins which is one of the main points countered by Brad Garlinghouse stated in his opinion of why centralized coins won’t really work. You are assuming that they all have each other‘s back‘s which is true but only up to a certain point. When it comes down to trying to gain control over digital assets the majority of banks will not relinquish control to any other bank. And this is one area where Ripples technology and XRP specifically stands out in that it is a distributed decentralized permission-less protocol. Despite your attempts and others to state that Ripple controls XRP it is simply incorrect. And even if you want to imagine in your mind that it’s true it’s not something that will be true in a matter of just a couple of years when their majority stake of XRP has been diminished.

The last point you stated is actual FUD that’s been disproven several times; the idea that somehow Ripple would control or have power over the banks if the banks utilized XRP.  Ripple cannot access the majority of their own XRP as it is time-locked, and within just a few years their majority of it will be gone. You are also just repeating the false logic that I pointed out earlier regarding ownership of a large amount of a crypto currency does not establish control of it and if you think it does then you have to apply that logic to all the others including J.P. Morgan’s coin. Be careful not to conflate Ripples ownership of a lot of XRP with their ability to control the decentralize ledger in which XRP is traded. Ripple does not control the decentralize ledger or any of the XRP that’s on the open market. ",19-02-15-20-22,2,417,CryptoTheSeaMonster,aquvj3

They are being used by Western Union and Santander. Big whoop. They are nothing. JPM Coin gives control to JPM, why would they give up that control to a silicon valley company?  JPM, GS, MS, etc they control the modern economy - they are not going to just give that up. And they are all in talks with one another in ""competition"" because they all employ the same people.  Yea they try and one-up each other here and there but they will not go for XRP under current conditions or they already would have. We are in a decade long bull market why haven't they adopted the tech yet? This move by JPM is not unique - guarantee by the end of the year other banks will come out with similar technologies.

Listen here's the gist because you are really not informed on the crux of financial system.  I am not saying that the JPM coin is great - I am not saying its decentralized, I am saying that it gives control to the banks. And Brad Garlinghouse is not sitting in the same room as Jamie Dimon and company - he is going on stage and selling something to people like you promising that you will all get rich because he is just so smart and knows all but the truth is that these banks that control the financial world are not going to just bend over and say - ""here's my ass Brad now fuck it so we can make more money."" They are going cut, copy, paste, and control. Systems will get faster, tech will get more sophisticated, and those who have been in control for 120 years will stay in control. xRapid sounds great on paper but there is a reason why it hasn't been adopted yet - we're in a 10 year bull market where these banks are sitting on more capital then they've ever held in history - they are going to spend that cash internally not on a glorified outside vendor.

You’re one of these people who keep forgetting to apply your arguments to the other side. It’s fine if you want to attack XRP or Ripple, it’s good to be critical. Unfortunately you keep focusing on XRP and Ripple (with some sort of unnecessary odd anger I might add that implies this is somehow personal to you) instead of understanding that your viewpoints equally apply to the other crypto currency’s and the banks themselves when they create their own crypto technology. All of the arguments you made can be turned right around against your point, for example when you say why would J.P. Morgan give control to a Silicon Valley well why would the other banks give control to J.P. Morgan? Hint, they won’t. And since your assumption about Ripple having control if their technology is used with XRP again as I pointed out earlier it’s a false assumption because it’s used on a decentralized permission-less ledger.  You keep ignoring that. You are also not listening at all to the points I’ve made. I’ve counted your FUD effectively but you then go on to repeat them as if you’re not listening to anything I said. You aren’t countering my follow-up points, just repeating yourself. Even when I tell you it doesn’t cost the banks money to utilize XRP it saves them money you keep trying to insist it will cost them billions. It’s a false argument I have debunked. And if the banks want to spend money internally to try and create their own token they may do so, and we all know they will, but it will just cost them money.  There are a lot of banks in the world that will not spend that money and will not do that and they will not give control over to J.P. Morgan either. Your position assumes that all these banks are going to get along and give up control to JP Morgan or each other’s coins and that’s just not going to happen.

That’s what you’re describing; individual banks with their own coin utilized among their partners establishing walled gardens, but look at the very first word, it’s “walled” which implies a border limit to what can be transacted. So even when the banks employ their own internal walled gardens they will run up against their own wall at which point their power or control ceases to be effective and another method must be utilized. This wall appears at the point of cross-border remittances. It’s when this wall is reached that the only safe and effective solution will be a decentralized permission-less open market ledger which is exactly where XRP steps in. So for as much is you want to dismiss Ripples technology or XRP itself you need to see where its place will be....it’s when this wall is reached and the only safe and effective solution is a decentralized permission-less open market ledger.

No they won't I agree, but they won't give control to Ripple as well. They'll copy JPM and create their own coin in the marketplace to allow for cross-border payments/settlement to be possible between parties.  It'll serve the interest of both sides.

> Even when I tell you it doesn’t cost the banks money to utilize XRP it saves them money you keep trying to insist it will cost them billions. It’s a false argument I have debunked. 

What would be in it for Ripple if they weren't paid? And if it was Free JPM and those on their level are more concerned about control not cost.

> Your position assumes that all these banks are going to get along and give up control to JP Morgan or each other’s coins and that’s just not going to happen.  

Nope they will work with the biggest bank in the world by creating their own technology to further control the world's assets. They won't be at the mercy of JPM but they will be in partnership - that's how business works.

> And no they don’t have to give Ripple control either, that’s the whole point of XRapid technology is it works on the decentralized permission-less ledger that does not give control to Ripple. You can keep repeating yourself and ignoring these points but it doesn’t change the reality of them. 

Okay so they don't want to give up control to Ripple but why is it in JPM's interest to give up control in general?

It doesn't matter what the currency is, but JPMorgan Coin is only good for *their* partners, it doesn't solve the issue of a bank outside their network interacting; unless the 'global standard,' is that coin there's a conflict of interest versus XRP which isn't governed by a competitive entity and is a neutral party. Luckily there's already an exchange in place to trade any coin/fiat!

So we have our first BankCoin, from what i recall arguments against BankCoin are trust as per the twitter comment linked. however it's a stable coin. so you trust it as much as you would tether, however unlike tether it probably will have an audit and its backed by JP. The reason why bitcoin was created the way it was, was to remove a potential bad actor, in this case the mint, the producer of tokens. thats what blockchain solves. however with an audit and compliance, perhaps thats good enough for banks to work with JP.

- unlike xrp, jpcoin is not volatile, yes xrp only has a 2-3 second payment window so volatility is kinda moot. but it does stop banks from wanting to hold xrp.

- this is a question: Since jpcoin is USD stable coin, how will remittance work? xrp is a bridge asset just like this coin, will it work the same way?

In case of payments, the other party you're sending money to has to trust that JPMCoin is really worth a dollar.  Why should they?  Its JPMC's word.  Whereas with XRP, exchanges all over the world have the values of XRP posted publicly.  And even if they do trust JPMC, they need to find someone that can cash out that JPMCoin.  JPMC would have to build an entire ecosystem and get exchanges/banks to pay them for JPMCoins.  Buy why would competitors pay them and share their wealth?  

Ripple isn't a bank.  Its goal is to make sure the XRP ecosystem is vibrant. Ripple has no desire to beat any of these banks at banking.  The more everyone succeeds using XRP, the more its worth.

Going through the official release it doesn't sound like JPMcoin is aiming at replacing swift and taking over international money transfers as the FUD would have you believe.

Instead it allows for JPMcoin's and in turns their money to be able to interact with other blockchains and DLT seamlessly without having the need of going through another crpto like tether or eth etc.

JPM already makes these international payments within its own company etc and will continue to do so, but now they have a way of moving their JPMcoin aka USD seamlessly throughout the crypto and DLT world.

Eventually as all money and assets become tokenised we would expect each company and country etc to generate their own token to be traded and interacted with all the other tokens? or possibly have one token act as an intermediary for all of them, or even a universal currency.

This would be a third party owned coin that could be refused to be redeeemed. This position is insane. They could hold the redemption hostage, void the redemption, blacklist banks, terminate accounts without warning.... Holding another countries actual US dollars, their native currency, or numbers in a system representing dollars,  cant work that way... because they are federal reserve note dollars, not JP morgan dollars. Although there is a right for many banks (like paypal) to seize your money, this would make it all the more easier, more legal, and literally inside the contract of the coin that it can be seized by the provider bank.

I'm not a fan of the federal reserve at all, i despise it and do not trust it... but in the united states we've tasked these type of actions to the fed and department of treasury only. NOT to a multinational private conglomerate. Yes i know fed is a private bank... But truly they have certain responsibilities to the USA, contracts for those responsibilities. I doubt JP morgan has to be (especially within the contract/whitepaper of the coin) loyal to the United States or to the companie they will be issueing the JPM coin to.

All of those things you mention are well and good, and will help the economy. But if you think every single bank wants JPM coin, and NOT US Dollars, thats wrong. (I'm not quite talking to you, but to anyone who believe this will be a huge success) 

Other financial institutions lawyers have much of a right to be skeptical. US dollars come with their own value based on a global economy. It derives no permissions. Theres no company that says you cant redeem US dollars. JPM coin can deny redemption of their coin at any time.

They are sure of themselves because the new version is already out, Each validator signs their proposals ands its known who voted for that amendment, thats how they know majority are in support of the amendment right now. It takes two weeks of support for it to be implemented, which is why they gave a date two weeks from now when others will be amendment blocked. If right now validators decided to change that support, the amendment would not be enabled.

2244,"It's interesting that that has him listed as a founder of Ripple, though the founder's agreement specifically stated that he didn't want to help cofound the company, and was being paid in XRP and wages...

Britto could give Satoshi a run for his money with how secretive he is.  The guy is still so much a mystery.",19-02-14-17-15,1,6500,thekiyote,aqgqmx
2245,"Hmm I don’t remember it being said that way, he was just behind the scenes the whole time.... only david took wages. chris, Jed, and Arthur took xrp....https://xrpcommunity.blog/the-founders-agreement/

Definitely, maybe he is Satoshi lmao",19-02-14-17-15,1,3455,mikenard77,aqgqmx
2246,"I've always interpreted the founders agreement as being a way of describing how Britto was going to be compensated, since he wasn't going to be going down as a co-founder of the company.  Specifically because of this line:  

> The Founders acknowledge that these Credits have no value as of the Effective Date **and that any compensation for work performed by Arthur Britto is provided in a separate consulting agreement with Open Coin Inc**.

The language, especially ""consulting"", implies that Britto's work with the firm is temporary, _however_, if Larson, McCaleb and Britto wrote this themselves, it could be just bad lawyerese.  In that case, two other versions of this agreement can exist, dictating the amount paid out to Larson and McCaleb, too (who we know also got an XRP payout).

The flip side of this is that, as far as I'm aware, Britto's name hasn't been on _anything_ public from Ripple after this agreement.  He's not sitting on their board, and he's not in the C-suite.  Which means that, if he's still with the company, he's only in an engineering level role.",19-02-14-17-15,1,6500,thekiyote,aqgqmx
2247,"As far as I understand that line refers to the work he already did being accounted for with the 2%. Any further work for ripple would require additional compensation.... the first line even considers Arthur a founder of ripple. Just to note at this time ripple was the XRP Ledger and payment platform(additional software), and open coin was the company.....

I believe they don’t mention the others allocations because they discuss 80% to the company and 2% to Arthur. There were many forks in the early days before xrp was xrp(xns), they already maintained 100% of the assets, there’s no need to mention them in an agreement which was specifically for Arthur’s compensation because he came on after....",19-02-14-17-15,1,3455,mikenard77,aqgqmx
2248,"Yes, I'm aware of the distinction.

The first sentence defines ""The Founders"" as being the founders of the platform, not the company. 

There's a _whole_ bunch of language in here that describes Britto as being a separate entity from the company, how he's getting compensated, what happens if the company creates a new coin, etc.  This isn't language that's typical for founding agreements of a _company_.  In those, typically founders lose _all_ rights to the new company, and get nothing back but ownership.

If this is all that we have to go on (and let's be honest, it basically is), I'd say that either Britto was planning on going his own way, or he's naturally skittish (also pretty likely, considering his intense privacy), and was demanding extra rights at the start _if_ he left the company.  McCaleb and Larson might have gone down the more traditional route.",19-02-14-17-15,1,6500,thekiyote,aqgqmx

However, if widely accepted and adopted (which is happening), Mojaloop could fix corridors that were previously or are currently lacking the necessary infrastructure for efficient local and international payments, making them brand new plausible targets for RippleNet/xRapid.

You should also bear in mind that xRapid needs very good and reliable crypto exchanges at both sides of the transactions. So there's also very important infrastructure needed in this regard.

Please take a look at this very informative thread, where Ethan MacBrough shares valuable insights on the potential value that Mojaloop could provide to RippleNet in the future:

Banks who issue digital assets still need a way to move and trade those assets.

 For example Bank A isn't going to take Bank B coin, especially in a cross boarder situation. Not only does that coin have counterparty risk from the backed asset, it has counterparty risk associated with the issuer as well. This is the same concept as fiat. There still needs to be a intermediary asset.  The same way xrapid buys xrp with USD and sells it for EUR, it can buy bank A coin and sell it for bank B coin. As well as banks issuing assets on other blockchains, for example jp morgan coin will be issued on several platforms and networks, possibly even the xrp ledger.

Our argument was about buying btc through xrapid, I was saying that doing it this way would save time as btc takes minutes to hours if sent through it's blockchain. I also was saying that it would allow to buy btc at lowest price possible at the market given that network of btc pools (exchanges etc) would be big enough.

Some selected snippets:

>The bill itself essentially has two distinct elements (*i.e. securities and tax modifications*) and it is easier to review them separately.  
...  
As you can probably see what the bill attempts to codify is a pure “utility token.” However, in my opinion this distinction misses the heart of the SEC’s concerns regarding digital assets. Carving out an exemption for a particular type of digital asset isn’t solving the problem; if anything it makes it worse.  
...  
Specifically, we know that the SEC views ICOs as meeting the Howey Test so this bill is proposing to specifically exempt what would otherwise be a securities transaction.  
...  
While Congress can, of course, change the definition of securities, they haven’t before with any other asset class so why would they start now? Specifically because the above carve out really is no longer necessary when you take into account recent SEC guidance. This bright-line distinction might have been more necessary back in May of last year when they started drafting this bill but the SEC subsequently released additional guidance which I believe adequately covers the majority of the points noted above.  
...  
Creating a hardline exemption is extremely dangerous because it would allow any digital asset which meets the basic technical standards above to be completely exempt from securities compliance, and the related investor protections.  
By way of example, under this proposed exemption an inexperienced issuer who purports to be able to create a digital asset which meets the technical standards above, would not only be able to offer and sell such digital assets (*or rights in them like a SAFT*) instantly and without regulatory oversight, they would be able to promote these investments in any way they wanted (*i.e. general solicitation*).  
Moreover, if said assets were specifically excluded from securities regulations, those who chose to invest in such assets would not be afforded the protections available under existing securities laws (*e.g. redress in the event the digital assets were never created/issued, fraud, etc.*). The investor concerns present in this example alone clearly illustrate the issue with proposing a bright line exemption. For clarity, it should also be noted that the wholesale exclusion of ICOs pursuant to proposed Section (a)(iii) is inherently flawed on its own. The majority of the fraudulent activities we have seen in this industry have been at the ICO level and specifically exempting these transactions from securities regulations is extremely dangerous.  
...  
The second portion of the bill ... First and foremost, this portion of the bill oddly defines “virtual currency” differently then it defined “digital tokens” in the first portion. Under this section, “virtual currency” is defined as “a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange and is not currency.” Ignoring all other issues for a moment, the fact that the definitions between the sections are not the same would only cause further confusion. Put another way, an investor who buys a “digital asset” based on the first section would then need to determine whether it qualifies as a “virtual currency” for the proposed tax rules.  
...  
Conclusion.  
Additional guidance on the offering/sale of digital assets and the tax treatment of gains/losses in connection with the trading of digital assets is **absolutely necessary**. This industry isn’t going anywhere and we need better guidance in those areas to help the industry grow in the proper way. However, this bill simply misses the mark on multiple fronts.  
While it’s a noble effort, *I simply cannot see this bill going anywhere in its current form.*

This is what I wrote: That's not how these new bank coins work and their purpose in the international monetary system. Do you think the SBI bank or the Bank of Saudi Arabia, or the Russian SBER bank or even Bank of America is going to accept JP Morgan coin without transaction costs? No. This is just a coin to make transactions easier within the JPMorgan network. These new bank coins reduce friction within a banking network, but overall increase it in interaction with other banking networks. The huge Japanese Mitsubishi group already is experimenting with their own coin for example, so is SBI Banks S-coin. There needs to be an intermediary mechanism between JPMorgan coin and MUFG coins and the increasing number of currencies, both digital and traditional. If anything this shows even more need for a settlement coin, as there will be hundreds if not thousand of more currencies in the world and the need for much more money in nostro and vostro accounts (unless a fast inexpensive digital asset were used to get the transfers done).",19-02-14-15-04,11,7,cryptojan,aqfoe7

Some select snippets:

>The bill itself essentially has two distinct elements (*i.e. securities and tax modifications*) and it is easier to review them separately.  
>  
>...  
>  
>As you can probably see what the bill attempts to codify is a pure “utility token.” However, in my opinion this distinction misses the heart of the SEC’s concerns regarding digital assets. Carving out an exemption for a particular type of digital asset isn’t solving the problem; if anything it makes it worse.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Specifically, we know that the SEC views ICOs as meeting the Howey Test so this bill is proposing to specifically exempt what would otherwise be a securities transaction.  
>  
>...  
>  
>While Congress can, of course, change the definition of securities, they haven’t before with any other asset class so why would they start now? Specifically because the above carve out really is no longer necessary when you take into account recent SEC guidance. This bright-line distinction might have been more necessary back in May of last year when they started drafting this bill but the SEC subsequently released additional guidance which I believe adequately covers the majority of the points noted above.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Creating a hardline exemption is extremely dangerous because it would allow any digital asset which meets the basic technical standards above to be completely exempt from securities compliance, and the related investor protections.  
>  
>By way of example, under this proposed exemption an inexperienced issuer who purports to be able to create a digital asset which meets the technical standards above, would not only be able to offer and sell such digital assets (*or rights in them like a SAFT*) instantly and without regulatory oversight, they would be able to promote these investments in any way they wanted (*i.e. general solicitation*).  
>  
>Moreover, if said assets were specifically excluded from securities regulations, those who chose to invest in such assets would not be afforded the protections available under existing securities laws (*e.g. redress in the event the digital assets were never created/issued, fraud, etc.*). The investor concerns present in this example alone clearly illustrate the issue with proposing a bright line exemption. For clarity, it should also be noted that the wholesale exclusion of ICOs pursuant to proposed Section (a)(iii) is inherently flawed on its own. The majority of the fraudulent activities we have seen in this industry have been at the ICO level and specifically exempting these transactions from securities regulations is extremely dangerous.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The second portion of the bill ...  First and foremost, this portion of the bill oddly defines “virtual currency” differently then it defined “digital tokens” in the first portion. Under this section, “virtual currency” is defined as “a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange and is not currency.” Ignoring all other issues for a moment, the fact that the definitions between the sections are not the same would only cause further confusion. Put another way, an investor who buys a “digital asset” based on the first section would then need to determine whether it qualifies as a “virtual currency” for the proposed tax rules.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Conclusion.  
>  
>Additional guidance on the offering/sale of digital assets and the tax treatment of gains/losses in connection with the trading of digital assets is **absolutely necessary**. This industry isn’t going anywhere and we need better guidance in those areas to help the industry grow in the proper way. However, this bill simply misses the mark on multiple fronts.

>While it’s a noble effort, *I simply cannot see this bill going anywhere in its current form.*

If not, send a link to Ripple saying something similar if you have one. Also, Hodor simply used that as an example, it wasn't intended to be an actual game plan.

I actually foresee a future where businesses are preordering escrow sales months in advance. If things take off 10 companies could buy 100 million per month. Could easily see a mega-bank/FI saying they'll take the whole stash. If Ripple has 100 companies asking for XRP each month, that 1 billion isn't going to go far.

We still don't know what other plans they have for those coins either. The Xpring initiative could be huge. There's too much going on with XRP for them all to fail.

2540,"Yes, it's frustrating that there's no wording in the article that clarifies why they presented the graph.

However I think you're wrong, because Ripple are going to use the XRP they have in escrow like a central bank, releasing XRP over time so that there is always inflation in the circulating supply and preventing other actors from getting a corner on the market.

And as I said, I think the demand will be there and Ripple wants to go hands off so they can be ""a payments company"". Ripple never intended to make money off of XRP. They make money licensing software. To me, XRP is just as much a thorn in their side as it is a giant treasure chest.

I think they're totally fine holding onto the coins until the time is right but as soon as things are up and running, they'll let them go. Maybe keep a billion coins in their stash to sell at a 1000 bucks.",19-02-14-00-54,1,3639,toieo83,aq6t65

But due to changes in market  conditions, we’ve chosen to eliminate the role of Chief Market  Strategist.” - this is the only statement I would go by as it is the official statement from Ripple. 

**""representing the company to  investors, press and regulators**."" This is what Cory's position really was. Representing the company to investors, press and regulators. Now press part doesn't really have much to do with market. Investors and regulators are the important players. If Ripple states that market conditions have changed with regards to these two groups that could mean that regulatory clarity is coming soon as we have seen from SEC's recent comment on tokens with functioning networks not being securities. Ripple at this point does not need outside investment, it is growing organically and it even has its own fund to invest in the ecosystem, thus investor relations/representation is also not necessary. My best guess is we are going to see regulatory clarity coming very soon and Cory's role in highlighting the difference between Ripple and XRP and representing the company to primarily press is thus over. 

More important is the fact that Ripple terminated the position. It's not a difference of opinion with Cory or some personal commitment. Ripple no longer believes it is necessary to educate industry and regulators which means the people who need to know already know what Ripple is trying to do. ",19-02-12-10-31,9,1,ed_33,apmkr6

Let me share a problem, that may be related to the topic of your article. When I first started out in crypto a few years ago, there were many difficulties in the space, especially in finding trust-worthy resources.  I did however find one website, bitcoin.org that did have some basic and objective articles for new people.  I had mentioned earlier that I do believe that there may be room for an xrp.org or even crypto.org to have crypto currency basics for new people that is transparent and objective.  But who has time to make and update this resource?

This is an interesting question, and I think it should be asked a slightly different way: i.e., ""what crypto websites do you trust with your NNNNN""

At this point, I just assume all of them attempt to compromise my privacy.  So they are not trustworthy with my privacy.  Probably none are.  

What websites do I trust with my bank account?  Well the answer to that is more complicated.  I trust the bank that I have to use here in the United States.  So by definition, I trust their website since I use their website.  

With regards to downloading a crypto wallet?  Right now, the XRP ecosystem is NOT ideal; One of the few complaints I have about Ripple is their decision to abandon the RippleTrade wallet and not outsource it to somebody else.  I think they were restricted due to the Fincen fine resolution, but really loved that RippleTrade wallet.  So essentially, new users have to ask around, and if I'm asked, I point them to a survey I take every six months or so of XRP Chat users and their favorite wallets.  

With regards to impartial XRP information, I think one fan took a pretty good shot at an equivalent to ""xrp.org"", but it's called xrp.co.  

Here is the link: https://www.xrp.co/


I really appreciate the point you brought up:  Ease of use is key, and the ease of downloading a secure XRP wallet, sponsored by Ripple in some way, would be ideal.

I'm assuming you are referring to a specific price movement; as I stated, I don't share my own estimates any longer.  

That being said, I can absolutely share this:  I am 100% confident in XRP, and I believe Ripple is the best crypto sponsor organization in the market today; no question at all.

Oh yeah!  The volume chart in this one: 
https://xrpcommunity.blog/xrp-the-best-crypto-choice-for-long-term-investors/


Yes.  I should definitely update that and include it.  To do that, I literally need a few hours to look at data and then do scenario analysis.  I'm not a banker, so all the data and analysis I do for part of it must be borrowed or extrapolated from what I've read of others.  

I'm a developer by trade, but I think I'm pretty good at observing patterns of adoption for technology, so I apply my own thinking to the non-banking categories of utility-driven volume.  

Some of those statistics also take / took into account the 'growth of an entire industry' as the cost of a transaction falls to near-zero and becomes real-time.  This is a shadow of what happened when 'snail mail' changed to 'email' in the late 1990s.  

In any case, I think you're right; it's time I sat down and updated that one.  

For the old one, I created a thread on XRP Chat and opened it up for debate in parallel.  Perhaps I'll do the same again.

This news ""came out"" too late to make it into yesterday's blog, but I hear you.  And yes, I'll be covering it in a blog on the ... 18th.  My next blog on the 14th is going to be a narrow, topic-oriented blog. (but I can't reveal anything until Valentine's Day)  

When it was confirmed by a news story later yesterday afternoon, my reaction was this: ""I'm not concerned.  These moves into and out of organizations by prominent c-level executives happen frequently in the business world.""

The interesting thing is that I have yet to see any official statement from either Cory or Ripple. 

> I apologize for it.

None necessary.  I appreciate the critical questions now and again, and despite the silence of other readers, having a sharp exchange every now and again provides clarity on some topics.  

However, you lucked out due to my knowledge of your history.  My *usual* reaction when somebody goes off topic or makes an attempt at editing what I should / should not talk about is to block.  It may sound a bit like censorship, but it's more about time management.  I simply don't have time to have debates with each reader about what I should / should not cover in my writing.  

> If you would be so kind to give an ""insight on R3 and SWIFT"" I would really appreciate it.

I actually did review that video and announcement by SWIFT... let me see if I can find the link.  Oh yeah - it was in my Superbowl-themed blog here:

I don't see R3 as doing anything negative / anti-Ripple since 2017 however; that's when the lawsuit was initiated.

A big part of this argument could be summed up as:

""Certain giant companies that make a fortune under the current system while screwing the little guys, will not straight up jump on the Ripple train. Also the most efficient currency pairing in the world will not likely see a bunch of XRP use. And finally Nostro Vostro is not just dormant money (even tho it kinda is) for the bank its not sitting in, but let me over explain why its not.""

The reason that I am suggesting for a new blog is that there comes a time when too much speculation and rumors are in the air it is necessary to counter it to establish one's stance.

That blog should also be comprehensive. I do not like Ripple Drop vids because I look at vid less than the counter ticking at the bottom and think in despair how the heck will i get satisfactory info in 3 or 3.5 minutes. Its a tense moment.

Then the dude goes on to describe the 2-3 day hurdles, and yes many corridors get the money to the proper hands faster even if this isn't direct settlement, but that's how we ended up here... that's not good enough.

Also dude uses USD/EUR pairing as his primary example, a relatively efficient corridor, like Ripple isn't targeting lesser used corridors anyways. Pure FUD right there.

And lastly of course there are built advantages for the large banks. That's why Ripple is trying to become a distruptor. Industry disruption is difficult because new tech / ideas are rarely straight up adopted by the existing powerhouses. Shit changes the status quo and their previously mentioned advantages. Advantages that in the cross boarder payment industry the little guys do not fully get. So yeah we get it, the big banks aren't going to be the first to jump on board.

3236,"It's fairly long, so here's the most relevant parts IMO:

>Yet many of these projects begin in a centralized manner that looks about the same as any other start-up. A group of people get together to build something and they need to find investors to fund their efforts so they sell securities, sometimes called tokens. The SEC applies existing securities laws to these securities offerings, which means that they must be conducted in accordance with the securities laws or under an exemption. When the tokens are not being sold as investment contracts, however, they are not securities at all. Tokens sold for use in a functioning network, rather than as investment contracts, fall outside the definition of securities.

...

>Director Hinman went on to explain, however, that because the token “all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in *Howey* were not,” a token sold in a securities offering might later be sold in a transaction that does not constitute a securities offering.[\[14\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn14) Once “a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosure becomes less meaningful” and offers and sales of tokens are no longer subject to the securities laws.[\[15\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn15) 

...

> While the application of the *Howey* test seems generally to make sense in this space, we need to tread carefully. Token offerings do not always map perfectly onto traditional securities offerings. For example, as a recent report from Coin Center noted, the decentralized nature of token offerings can mean that the capital raised through token sales may not be truly owned or controlled by a company. Functions traditionally completed by people designated as “issuers” or “promoters” under securities laws—which, importantly, bestow those roles with certain responsibilities and potential liabilities—may be performed by a number of unaffiliated people, or by no one at all.[\[16\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn16)  
>  
>Additionally, I am worried that the application of the test will be overly broad. The Supreme Court in *Howey* embraced a “flexible rather than static principle, one that is capable of adaptation,”[\[17\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn17) an unwelcome phrase for people craving clarity. The subsequent application of the Supreme Court’s decision has further added to the ambiguity by diluting factors, such as the prong that asks whether the investors were anticipating “profits to come solely from the efforts of others.”[\[18\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn18) “Solely” has gotten dropped in the application of this prong. In the years since *Howey*, many courts have instead focused on whether profits are derived in effect *principally* from the efforts of others. This approach has been formulated by one appellate court as a question of whether “the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.”[\[19\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn19) More to the point, the Commission itself determined in 2017 that tokens issued by the DAO, a decentralized organization based on a distributed ledger, were securities despite the fact that token-holders had certain roles within the organization necessary to its operation.[\[20\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn20)

...

>It is possible that some projects may simply not be able to work under the existing *Howey* framework and the applicable securities laws. One cryptocurrency project, Basis, has announced that it will shut down operations and return $133 million in capital to investors due to the difficulty—if not impossibility—of complying with securities regulations given the team’s vision for the project.[\[21\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn21)I am not going to comment on what I think about the merits of any particular project or how the securities laws apply to it, but my antennae will go up when apparently legitimate projects cannot proceed because our securities laws make them unworkable.  
>  
>Ambiguity is not all bad, of course. We might be able to draw clearer lines once we see more blockchain projects mature. Delay in drawing clear lines may actually allow more freedom for the technology to come into its own.[\[22\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn22)  
>  
>Congress may resolve the ambiguities engendered by *Howey* by simply requiring that at least some digital assets be treated as a separate asset class. Congressmen Warren Davidson and Darren Soto recently introduced a bill in the House intended to amend the federal securities laws to do just that, provided that the token truly operated in a decentralized network.[\[23\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn23) Such an approach would facilitate more tailored disclosure. Indeed there are others who have argued that, whether ICOs can fit within the definition of a securities offering does not answer the question of whether that is how we should regulate them.  

...

>That careful thinking, however, may mean frustration for the innovators hoping for quick answers about what the relevant regulations are. Channel that frustration by coming and talking to us about how you think we should approach these regulatory questions.[\[32\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine#_ftn32) Sometimes I feel like the repairman in the ATM sending slips of paper to the outside world asking for help. In my case, I am asking for help on getting the regulations right so that innovators and entrepreneurs can spend their time and attention on making better products, providing better services, and revolutionizing the way we interact with one another.

Some perspective...

The volatility here is insane.... and there's no doubt that this makes for completely unpredictable price swings. The volatility is probably keeping new money out of the market, which is a bad thing overall and contributes to the overall current bearish sentiment and trend.

However, having said that, speculative markets do this. They need to then mature with clear fundamentals. This market is like a 6 month old pulling themselves up onto the couch to try and walk. Sometimes it makes some progress and appears to be successful. Mostly it ends in tears. Over time it will be up and running.

Any hint of clear fundamentals (e.g. regulation, ETF, increased adoption) will put a rocket up this market. The cryptos that are well-positioned to take advantage of this will have the most to gain.   


I strongly believe that XRP is one of the coins built around products with a sound foundation... that's why I'm here.

There are a handful of others in the same boat. The rest are shite coins and will initially tag along for the ride, but will fade away over time as money pours out of them and into the real deal coins when most intelligent ppl cash out their profits from the shite coins. By all means feel free to speculate in some of the shite.

In the meantime... enjoy the sideshow alleys and fireworks... because it's just a prelude to the main event. The main event will be a strong bull run leading into a divergence (the alt coins with fundamentals will diverge from the shite).

approach  to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work.  (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it  may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad  federal law was passed.)  
 

**(\*) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses**  
**(\*) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected**  
( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money  
( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks  
**(\*) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it**  
( ) Users of email will not put up with it  
( ) Microsoft will not put up with it  
( ) The police will not put up with it  
( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers  
**(\*) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once**  
**(\*) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers**  
( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists  
( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business  
 

Specifically, your plan fails to account for  
 

( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it  
**(\*) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email**  
( ) Open relays in foreign countries  
( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses  
( ) Asshats  
( ) Jurisdictional problems  
**(\*) Unpopularity of weird new taxes**  
**(\*) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money**  
**(\*) Huge existing software investment in SMTP**  
**(\*) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack**  
( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email  
( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes  
( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches  
**(\*) Extreme profitability of spam**  
( ) Joe jobs and/or identity theft  
**(\*) Technically illiterate politicians**  
( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers  
( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves  
( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering  
**(\*) Outlook**  
 

and the following philosophical objections may also apply:  
 

**(\*) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical**  
( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable  
( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation  
( ) Blacklists suck  
**(\*) Whitelists suck**  
( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored  
( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud  
( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks  
**(\*) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually**  
**(\*) Sending email should be free**  
**(\*) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?**  
**(\*) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses**  
( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem  
( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome  
( ) I don't want the government reading my email  
( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough

The biggest problem I see is that users will want to set up ghost email accounts they don't actually use. How does an ad buyer know which addresses are real? That will drive the value of those impressions *way* down to the point that a user has no incentive to switch. The magic of Google and Facebook is that they catch users doing things they *definitely* want to be doing and get obscene amounts of information about those users' preferences. Email spam is by definition low value. Higher value spam like sale announcements people sign up for.. well.. they're already signing up for it. No need to pay them for the privilege.

3456,"In this situation, you want KYC because it increases the advertising value of the email account and is what prevents people from being able to set up what you call ""ghost"" email accounts.  Social email will work differently than how traditional email works.  I will be able to control who can send me e-mail and at what cost.  These preferences will be able to be adjusted based on the type of communication I am receiving from people and businesses and the type of communication I would like to receive in the future.

Advertisers will adjust their spending based on the responses they get.  If they can't make a profit through their emails they will stop sending them.  

For example, social email would be an awesome way to offer a dating service because with KYC it would be impossible for customers to have fake profiles.  So let's say I'm a girl and I want to narrow down how many men can contact me.  I might raise the cost to send me an email to 5 xrp.  If I don't like the guy I would probably keep the coin.  If I like him I'll send it back.  Social email would be the safest dating that exists.  It would weed out anyone that was shady and had something to hide because with KYC they couldn't hide.

> Yet many of these projects begin in a centralized manner that looks about the same as any other start-up. A group of people get together to build something and they need to find investors to fund their efforts so they sell securities, sometimes called tokens. The SEC applies existing securities laws to these securities offerings, which means that they must be conducted in accordance with the securities laws or under an exemption. When the tokens are not being sold as investment contracts, however, they are not securities at all. Tokens sold for use in a functioning network, rather than as investment contracts, fall outside the definition of securities.

I must reiterate, It is important to be critical of its use-case applications.  We cannot depend on the corporate world to tell us what is good for us.

It says that Swift GPI is being used for $300 billion in global transfers each day, and that 40% of these settle within 5 minutes, and 50% settle within 30 minutes.

It is worth noting that when Swift talks about the drawbacks from Ripple's approach, they are only talking about xCurrent, not xRapid. Since there are a bunch of (seemingly?) happy xCurrent customers already, their concerns seem a bit overblown.

The article also points out this:

>At the end of January, Swift announced that it is partnering with R3 to have GPI Link work with its Corda Settler distributed ledger. News accounts gave the impression that the giant payment network was embracing the idea that faster distributed-ledger technology will replace the framework of correspondent banks, nostro accounts, and the store-and-forward messages that Swift maintains, and that Swift was going to use XRP, the digital currency of Ripple. The price of XRP shot up.  
>  
>However, none of this is true.  
>  
>Companies use R3’s Corda Settler to trade among one another. R3 is adding Swift’s GPI to the options Corda-Settler-using companies can turn to when they want to initiate a payment, besides using XRP. The payment itself will settle between banks as usual over the Swift network and the corporates will be able to track the payments. So this is actually a win for Swift over Ripple.

So what?  Do you really not realize why this is such a huge difference in meaning?  You are really downplaying the fees for some odd reason when that is a HUGE point in all this.  I'm not trying to be rude, but do you have any experience in international remittance or with the the consumer that uses these?  I used to routinely send international wires for people that were paying $35 to send $100 back ""Home"".  Western Union can be much, much more expensive.  I can say with certainty that for customers lower fees are MUCH more important than speed.  And you get lower fees only when the bank/remitter saves money.  So THAT is why customers do and should care about settlement times for the banks and whats ""Going on behind the scenes"".

The real question you should be asking is why a customer would care when a payment arrives.  Heres a great example.  My landlord charges me $45 if I were to pay rent by credit card (I realize this is due to processing fees), even though its credited immediately to him.  If I pay by check, its free, and its immediately to my credit, but the funds don't clear for the landlord for several days.  Why do I care about how quickly he gets settled payment?  I want the cheapest option that is to my credit, so I'll be doing a check. ",19-02-09-10-04,0,85,Believable_Nova,aoma0g

If banks decide that they will opt for SWIFT gpi and prefer having Nostro Vostro then it will be a tough fight.

Keep in mind that to shift bankers on anything new is difficult. SWIFT gpi will make it more difficult.

Also some online sources make the same mistake I have and refer to this as settlement within 30 minutes, not creditted.

We've now discussed what the difference between them is and I've learned something and will henceforce say credited instead of settled and if anyone asks the difference I can tell them thanks to you. I wasn't trying to convince anyone that this didn't matter or was settlement, I was trying to encourage people to read the article themselves by pulling out some interesting snippets from it. I misquoted that one part though ignorance, which you then decided to attack me over without providing adequate context for why I was wrong and why the difference mattered.

Also your landlord example is just one case where you don't care about the money arriving quickly, that hardly negates my point. Your own example of someone being willing to pay $35 to send $100 internationally likely suggests that this is an emergency payment, hence they would care about speed more than cost.",19-02-09-10-04,2,11,froggleblocks,aoma0g

In reality, this is probably where the market turns around. Why? Well, typically I try to save my biweekly purchases when the market trades sideways and a suspected breakdown is looming. We then get a small increase and I fomo buy, watch it increase a couple percents more over the next few days and then crash down. Right about now is when I should be fomoing in but I'm not. I have a few biweekly purchases stalled and waiting to enter on the next sharp drop. I told myself I will not buy until that happens. If the market goes up, I have enough to be happy and I'll put that towards my Jamaica trip. It will probably be a slow, annoying recovery. Some day I will look back to now and regret not buying in.

Could it be that this remain untill the market turns bullish, could that be that time that xrp soars?
I mean i think the big reason that price hasnt changed is all due to to the market sentiment, which in turn corresponds to BTC sentiment.

Only Ripple/XRP is undoubtedly the safest bet. But we have to admit that late 2017 is gone, and it will take a long time for XRP to possibly crawl back to $3.8. 2019 won't do nothing, SBI Exchange and Fidelity Custody are nothing but a farce, an elaborate ploy to dump the coins again and again.

Only with real usage, with dozen of banks adopting xRapid, with at least 20 banks like Mr. Kitao conjectured or the security lawsuit is resolved that could lift XRP outta this cesspool. And I don't see it happens in 2019 at all, it's just gonna be a boring year. I don't think we gonna dump any lower, but $1 anytime this year sounds farfetched as well.

Here to waiting till at least 2020/2021. Cryptocurrency is a scam, we all know that (and if the Ripple company failed to deliver them promises, failed to reinforce the infrastructure thus attracting major financial entities rather than shit banks and tiny weeny remittance companies, then XRP will be a fraud and I would be glad to dump all of this shitcoin). Investing in XRP means putting your money in the least scammy and most professional project, which has the highest plausibility to succeed.

I have a more positive gut feeling about 2019, and over time I've been in the ""very right"" and ""very wrong"" category of crypto predictions - both in the negative and positive direction.

However, I think there are some interesting developments happening in 2019 that we didn't see in 2018.  SBI is one.  

I'm not one of those that think things will happen overnight, but there could be some major changes in the works, and I've noticed that volume trends can change rather dramatically over short periods.

Two things came to mind, one, the timelines for crypto/DLT to fully permeate and transform the World - at the end of that video of Bard and the VCs at Davos, he gets almost wistful, quietly mentioning how many years the adaptation process will prolly take.

The other, regarding the investment pros, I've noticed two clues recently. One, that spike we saw when the R3/SWIFT trial was made public. For such a minor piece of news, it demonstrated the coiled springs there are all ready to jump at every sign and revelation.

The second, on Feb 8th, the broad spike we saw, which I strongly suspect was caused by that SEC item posted on that same day. The regulatory uncertainty in US has no doubt been a damper on many speculative investors, which now looks more promising (after reading that long piece).

However, it seems like SBI has been very circumspect about security and doing slow roll-outs now in the wake of the Coincheck hack in early 2018.  

I do think it will be huge, but my guess is that we'll see it in stages throughout 2019.

If it is costing you money to hold your money in a bank, you will cash out and put it all in a safety deposit box. Eventually, due to fractional reserves, the banks run out of cash and giant economic crash follows.  By having eCash, fractional reserves are gone and all eCash is always part of the “banking system” since there is no physical good which can be pulled from eCash.  When a negative interest rate hits, there can be no run on the banks, since there is no physical cash to pull from the banks and the banks to run out of. ",19-02-08-00-48,1,377,Daleeburg,ao3w6v

3930,"Payment channel ""TPS"" just means that you're able to sign the current state of a channel on modern hardware a few 10k times per second in theory. Even network latency will drop this down a huge amount and in real life you're anyways probably quite unlikely to pay something in milisecond or microsecond increments. This is also only about updating the state of a PaymentChannel, not actually transmitting/settling that value.

What's usually more limiting or relevant for such systems is the time to settle the channel in the optimal and worst case:

Optimally, there's enough space in the next block, so in XRPL you can settle definitely after a few seconds, on Bitcoin for a very high probability after an hour or so. The latter might still be fine, if you're settling rarely anyways, the former is obviously nice if you want better guarantees and speed.

Worst case means all payment channels in the whole system settle at the same time. This leads to a load spike on the network. In optimal conditions (everyone on the same GBit LAN, few validators, simple transactions) rippled was benchmarked to 1500 tx/s, in reality the number is probably quite a bit lower, but still quite a lot above the artificial cap of systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum (XRPL blocks don't have a size limit).

Real world observed data shows that XRPL can clearly handle more than a million transactions per day, Bitcoin had its peak at about a third of XRPL's numbers so far (but is artificially limited). Bitcoin forks with larger block sizes have not yet been actually battle tested (or spammed...) in the wild. It would be interesting to see some actual independent benchmarks on testnets on how a more realistic settlement rate would look like. Considering the simpler fee mechanics and economics of XRPL, I'd still assume that it would come out far ahead (settling a payment channel is relatively simple: Remove the PayChan object, reduce one XRP balance and increase the other).",19-02-07-19-15,3,1008,Sukrim,ao1lib

There was no infastructure and Wall Street rushing into the dot com after the crash. There was no thriving dot com OTC...

Lets assume that the whole XRP supply is fractured around the world and some of it is either locked in escrow or by other means. And that enough trades happen around the clock. 
Now you want to send money so you want to buy 3m XRP that you can do so faster. You suck up the coins from where you are. There is now less supply and the same demand. Price goes up. 
You transfer the XRP and dump them somewhere else. You are fine now but the financial world does not stop. In that place the price goes down. 
This happens multiple times a day. But the flow will not be consistent in time and direction. Therefore it will always create a higher demand in some places. More demand is a higher price. And some will want to provide that poor people in need  of XRP help. So they will sell them some but of course at a higher rate because they want to make profit.

Research into how forex markets function can give great insights to Ripple's vision for XRP. In our current debt economy arbitrage between $ exchange rates are tied to the imports/exports of a country and money movement (a lot more complex but these are some instruments).

International money transfers have always been the goal for Ripple. XRP leaves one exchange in country A and enters the market in exchange B. Here there's a chance of arbitrage where there's a price differential between the two international exchanges (a small difference but one of good potential return with large capital). The important thing to remember is transactions don't happen in isolation so as the number of transactions increase the demand for liquidity increases as well. Modern forex exchange practices will become the market makers in the XRP economy as they trade XRP within and between competing exchanges. This trading will also utilize a good fraction of the XRP reserve. As the stress of transactional volume increase more people will attempt to trade it and there will be less XRP so the price will increase to keep up with demand as people are willing to pay more to continue to trade it is as the amount of transactions increase. It's circular and this chicken and egg problem is exactly why Ripple created XCurrent and XVia as a springboard for getting this ball rolling.",19-02-07-15-04,8,38,OldSoulsDieYoung,anzpqe
4028,It just creates arbitrage and that doesn’t last long. Someone will buy where it’s cheap and sell it where the price is higher. The difference will disappear.

4032,"I kind of see what you’re saying but with the massive amount of XRP already available and what’s still in escrow, it just seems like a huge number. Even with all the people holding, I still don’t think FI’s are going to “hold” XRP as much as they are going to “use” it. Which leaves a lot to be bought up by the actual holders. I use amazon as an example. It has 480 million shares outstanding and is around $1600.00 a share. That’s about $800 billion. That’s a lot of the worlds physical money tied up right there. Now take that $800 billion and divide it by 40 billion XRP and that’s $20 each. And that’s the price with everyone holding it. Now take into account most of the FI’s “using” XRP only need it for a few seconds at a time. The majority of those 40 billion are going to be sitting around unsold. That’s not gonna fly very long. People will sell and price drops, all the while FI’s are still moving the same amount of money.

Even if Ripple/XRP took the place of Swift’s $5 trillion a day, divide that by 24 hours of transactions in a day, that’s $208 billion an hour. And if you divide that by a measly 20 billion circulating XRP, that’s only $10.00 a piece needed. With ALL of SWIFT’s current market!

4033,"If it’s price is holding rock solid and I’m an FI, why would I want to hold it? I’d just buy it as needed.

4036,"The burn rate /u/Denisozo brings up is definitely one element to keep in mind, but we'll keep that in the *backburner*. 

Using the quick settlement time of XRP as part of the equation is unfair because it's a technical aspect inherent to the ledger and not a bottleneck to its fiat value. Just because it can settle faster does not inherently mean more fiat to fiat transactions occur (it could--and most likely WILL--lead to more transactions but as a function of increased capital due to the innovation of instantaneous settlement). 

It is more fair to breakdown the average fiat value per transaction. The $5 trillion a day is handled by 24 million transactions, so the weight of one transaction is roughly 208k. Here one XRP needs to carry the weight of $480.

Furthermore, it's important to remember the nostro/vostro element in all of this. A bank carries a huge risk holding on to volatile currency. In plenty of financial instruments, holding XRP would be hedging against some of this volatility. Similarly, if XRP is working as it is intended, its value would be steadily increasing as its use increases regardless.",19-02-07-15-04,2,38,OldSoulsDieYoung,anzpqe

That makes no sense.  Simply making something more readily available doesn't increase demand.  If there's one person in your street who wants to buy a new car, opening 10 new car dealerships on that street isn't going to increase demand - the demand remains the same (1 person wanting to buy 1 car).

The various people that set up the servers also maintain them. Users are not rewarded in most cryptocurrency systems I know, definitely not in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Because they prefer XRP for whatever reason. Nobody is forced to use any of these 3, they are not mandatory in any jurisdiction I know.

> If Ripple going after bank, why would bank use Ripple network instead of creating their own using ERC20?

Because Ethereum is a few years younger than the XRPL for starters, also if you look at stuff like CryptoKitties you'll see that Ethereum has a few throughput and speed issues. Lastly Ethereum tries to be a solid basis for all kinds of smart contracts while XRPL has a more narrow focus and is more optimized for its use cases (but sacrificing stuff like a turing complete built-in VM for example).

> Also can any developer contribute to Ripple code?

Any developer can try to contribute code to the main repository, if it actually gets merged depends on code reviews, similar to most other open source projects out there. The code is under ISC license, so you are definitely allowed to take the code and also to distribute your own versions if you want to, so not getting merged doesn't stop you in any way from running it or letting others run it.

If your own UNL list contains only 1 approved name by ripple and 9 NOT, then you only further **RELAY** already validated transactions by the UNL. Because that is the point of being validated by ripple and have your name written down by ripple in the first place.

If your own list doesn't contain any name approved by ripple, even if this list would be used by hundreds of thousands of other people, then all these transactions of you and these people, even if this would represent a much bigger majority, not a single transaction will be valid.

Once again.. using same UNL as ripple doesn't **truly** make you a validator, because these names imposed by ripple do the validation job.

Why does it work in this way with very few centralized validators ? Well because ripple cannot have high throughput with everyone verifying and relaying transactions. It's actually more centralized by dPOS even.

The conclusion is, ripple decides who is really a validator because it's impossing the UNL list, which they write. Therefore centralized.

https://dailyhodl.com/2019/02/03/ripple-partner-euro-exim-bank-successfully-integrates-xrp-powered-xrapid/",19-02-04-22-14,9,2084,jim_knox,an0pdj
4665,Xrapid is one way to use xrp. Ripple net members can also use xrp directly with xcurrent/xvia with other ripple net members acting as Liquidity “exchangers” / provides instead of exchanges. ,19-02-04-22-14,7,3456,mikenard77,an0pdj
4666,"Basically to use xRapid with a destination currency, there has to be an entity that will accept your XRP and return you that currency is exchange for that XRP.

What xRapid automates is the initial purchase of XRP, sending it to that entity and then taking the fiat that entity used to by the XRP and directing the fiat to a destination account.

That last step uses the ""local (payment) rails"" to get the fiat from the entity to the destination account. In most countries fast domestic payment rails exist which can move that money in real time, or perhaps for multi-million transfers, overnight.

In general terms we expect the entity to be a retail exchange where many people are buying and selling XRP, much like a standard FOREX exchange. But it could be a bank or 'liquidity provider' that is happy to be involved in the transaction because they want to buy XRP off you for their own future use. This is particularly more likely to be the case for large transactions, where the retail exchange does not have sufficient liquidity to absorb a large XRP sale.",19-02-04-22-14,2,11,froggleblocks,an0pdj
4667,">I am wondering how xrapid could work in countries that doesn´t yet have exchanges

&#x200B;

Xrapid is all about sourcing liquidity via exchanges, so having an exchange with FIAT-crypto pair is a must.

But when we reach a stage where XRP is held by banks/FIs, exchanges won't be needed. But for this a country's regulators should give sufficient clarity on what banks/FIs can or can't do.

In situations where regulation clarity is not esablished there is the alternative - Multihop

>xCurrent->xRapid multihop allows an xCurrent customer (usually a  bank) to settle its payments with funds someone else (the xRapid  customer) bought with XRP. The bank never holds XRP and the xRapid  customer's txn is outside the bank's.  
>  
>**This scheme was a response to customer issues involving regulatory  problems holding XRP or having an XRP flow inside their payment txns**. I  think we've demonstrated a pattern of listening to our customers and  that's why we keep gaining more of them.

> We had already created a cloud-based blockchain enabled trade finance application, so it was a quick decision to join other global Ripple participants for the first project, namely using the xCurrent service where institutions are able to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking and visibility.

> Euro Exim Bank are now working closely with technical resources at Ripple, and have successfully implemented the xRapid system for customers requiring low value remittances in currencies and jurisdictions typically subject to large exchange costs, costly liquidity and delivery time and acceptance issues.

And later:
>  Our proof of concept is already complete. We are happy to report that Euro Exim Bank have already started instructing global payments using the Ripple xCurrent DLT platform. Our next steps are to make trade finance instruments available via the same delivery mechanism, enriching payment instructions with the underlying Letter of Credit information, and extend our low-liquidity real-time xRapid capabilities.

So Euro Exim Bank do a lot of transactions with regard to international trade, for which they seem to be using xCurrent. It seems the use case for xRapid is going to be low value remittances, which is what every other customer is doing with it right now as well - not surprising given the price of XRP.

Interesting read and it has some solid points. However, I would like to point out a potential falsehood that is shared with the readers.  In my opinion, no blockchain or crypto has achieved high decentralization or even close to it - yet.  Calling XRP highly decentralized is like going back in time to 1997 and saying that Amazon was the largest retailer.  While the eventual projection may hold merit as true, I have to disagree with your opinion as it currently stands.

I don't agree with this statement, and here's why:  Ripple operates only 7% of the nodes on the network, and runs 27% of the nodes on the 'Recommended' (NOTE, not 'required') UNL.  

In the XRPL, validators can choose to use their own UNL if they wish, or they can choose to use the validators on the 'recommended' UNL.  Even if they choose the 'recommended' UNL, Ripple still only represents 27% of those validators.  

In addition, if you look at the overall count of validators - sort of equivalent to a 'has power' measurement in POW - Ripple accounts for only 7% total.

There was an intentional disinformation campaign launched by early Bitcoin owners in 2013 to suppress not only XRP, but any other cryptocurrency they perceived as a thread to Bitcoin's market share.  As hard as it is to believe, one Bitcoin owner even bribed social media posters on a large scale to lie about Ripple when they first publicized the innovation of the XRP Ledger.

4784,"That article is interesting in that they have considered other aspects of centralisation, however there are 2 components they've picked which I don't think are particularly illustrative of anything: code-base commits by developer, and exchange volume.

The reason being economies-of-scale and the general principle of the rich get richer.

In any (commercial) software development, there are always going to be a handful of developers responsible for the majority of code commits. This is due to expertise, experience and the plain old ""rockstar developer"" trope. You actually would be very suspicious of an application that had perfectly distributed code commits as that graph shows as being ""perfectly decentralised"". In very large pieces of software you'll have many thousands of contributors, in which case the pattern will apply to modules within the software - one group of developers will dominate a particular module but will still have some contributions to other modules within the system (particularly in areas that directly communicate with the one they are the experts in).

Sure, you can measure how many contributors one code base has compared to another, but I don't think this is a particularly useful comparison. It doesn't really matter who/how the code was written, just that it was. What is ultimately more important is frequency of changes and long-term commitment, with the highlight that an application that is reliant on fewer people has higher risks for long-term interest and maintenance, although with as profitable and interesting as ethereum and bitcoin are I doubt developer interest is an issue for the top contributors.

Secondly for the volume traded on exchanges, customers go where the most liquidity is, as well as other aspects such as ease of use, fees and KYC requirements etc. There will always be combinations of ease-of-use / KYC / fees /security that are inferior to other exchanges, since they aren't all running identical software or being administered by the same people - and even if they were, 2nd order effects such as responsiveness/uptime and plain old random popularity will ensure that some exchanges are always more popular than other exchanges.

Now again, it's possible to make comparison between coins, but the total number of exchanges is probably more illustrative than the volume being traded on exchanges. On the other hand, for a mature coin that has achieved mainstream adoption (as we hope for XRP one day) it is likely that there would be a good handful of very liquid exchanges, mapping to countries - eg there will be exchanges for pound stirling, yen, AUD, USD, rupees etc that all have high volumes, even if within each country there is still a long tail.

These same principles of economies-of-scale and rich-getting-richer likely apply to the other metrics too, but I haven't put much thought into it.

Re: centralization.  I agree that it *should* be a multi-faceted measurement, but when POW advocates talk about it, they have historically zeroed in on the validation part.  

And to tell you the truth, we are making steady progress on the non-validation, other metrics you referenced as well.  There was just a community-driven amendment added to the new code in the last week that will be a part of the XRP code with 1.2.0.  

And ownership metrics have steadily decreased the minimum required for reaching the 'top 1%' of ownership over the last year since we've been taking the measurement.  

But note that I still concede little in that regards to Bitcoin.  I think they have definite trouble with code updates, with the Segwit Bip being blocked by two mining pools and stopped.  

And also their ownership centralization looks little better than ours.  I'll see if I can find the link...

Like a slow simmer, or cooking on low heat makes the best food, the simmering price on XRP leads me to believe it's in for a really meteoric rise when ""it"" happens. I get the feeling that not only are people in the know stocking up immensely why they can, but the price is being kept low to possibly let weak hand retail investors sell due to boredom or lack of confidence, therefore allowing banksters and insiders to get more even cheaper. I refuse to believe this asset is worth only a couple cents. The magnitude of what it offers is unlike anything else the banking world has ever seen, and it's being led by Ripple who is comprised of elites and ex-bankers, even ex-SWIFT members.

It really is that simple. As long as there is enough volume to support that, the price of a token is under the hood, if you will. Unless the FI has invested in XRP to fill their own large bags v. using a LP, they likely wouldn't care less about price as long as it remains stable enough to make a predictable transactions. They will not lose confidence. The price isn't going to fluctuate enough in the few seconds it takes to settle a tx for that to matter anyway.

Prices will stay low if no one is actually using it, and nobody will use it because they're still waiting for higher prices.

I think, investment aside, if we really want to realise XRP's potential as a world currency, is to use it in such a context. Sure you can use your visa card, but what if you're overseas? Going on a holiday outside of your fiat market? You'll be hit with exchanges anyway, but moreover, the guy at a counter has to take his cut too.

If we want to foster in more utility for this coin, which will increase the value of your investment, I think we should consider using it as well, not only to add liquidity to XRP, but to also support and encourage others to adopt it at a mainstream level.

You can just re-purchase the same amount of coins everyday as you use it. Just think of it as wash-trading. Only... legal.

What I do know as a traveler is that over the past 10 years or so Visa has become much more accepted worldwide.  When I lived in Europe 12 years ago I had to have a Visa and a Mastercard in case one or the other wasn't accepted.   Amex was the most commonly accepted back then, but I've traveled to a couple different continents in the past few years with only a Visa and I've been totally fine.  Some places were very remote, non tourist type places.

Still, the new version of xCurrent offers benefits to customers who have not chosen to integrate xRapid.

Among the most notable improvements in xCurrent 4.0 is a feature called “multihop,” which allows payments to be relayed through a chain of xCurrent users. The existing payments system relies on a few large money center banks such as Citi, which act as hubs, Birla said.

Multihop could allow smaller regional players such as Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand to “get the same sort of reach that a larger correspondent bank can,” he added.""

5137,"It refers to the buying cost on an exchange. It applies on both side of the transaction, but I'll use the first buy-side for this example.

Say I want to transfer someone $50,000 AUD over xRapid and I have USD. Looking at the current order books for USD and AUD <-> XRP, I determine that if I buy 120,000 XRP on the US exchange, they can then be re-sold on the Auzzie exchange in return for $50,000 AUD.  


Say the USD exchange is very *liquid*. This means there are lots of buy and sell orders on the books, with a very minimal spread between them. If I need to buy 120,000 XRP, I can easily buy all of them at just 30c each, so it costs me a total of $36,000.

Now compare this to a case where the USD exchange is not very liquid. Maybe I can buy 100,000 XRP at 30c each, but then because of the illiquidity of the market right now, to buy another 20,000 XRP I have to pay 50c each. So my total cost is $30,000 USD for 100k XRP, and then another $10,000 USD for the final 20k XRP, for a total cost of $40,000.

In this case, the $4,000 extra cost in the second example is called ""slippage"".

Normally when the market is very liquid, the transfer can be done for $36,000 USD. But when the market is illiquid, the transfer costs $4,000 extra in slippage, at $40,000 total.

In this simple example I am using very wide price points, at 30c and 50c. In a real market it's more like there will be a certain amount of XRP available at 30c, and then more at 30.1c, and then more at 30.2c and then more still at 30.3c etc. But the ""height"" you have to go up the order book represents the total slippage of the transaction.

If I could buy a full 120,000 XRP at precisely 30c, then I have not had any slippage at all. But if there is inadequate liquidity, then maybe most of my XRP was bought at 30c, but then I had to pay 31c for some of it, and 32c for the last little bit of it. That extra amount from the 31c and 32c trades would be the slippage.

So for very large transactions there is always likely to be some slippage, even in very very liquid markets. But the less liquidity in the market there is, the higher the slippage will be, and the higher the total cost of the transaction will be. With markets that are not very liquid, the slippage for large transactions is so high that it is not worth doing those transactions, even though smaller transactions could still be accommodated with minimal or no slippage.

This probably isn't a great explanation, but it's enough that if you google 'slippage' in a finance context, you should now be able to understand any other article that describes it in more technical language.

>Is your main claim (about slippage) that there are reasonable levels of slippage and xrp markets aren’t liquid enough to achieve them?

For large transactions, yes. Slippage effectively makes up part of the cost of transaction - it's not a fee that you pay to your payment provider, but a cost that you pay to the market participants.

>If so, do you know what slippage would exist in the example you gave about transferring USD do AUD?

Well the AUD market is even smaller and less liquid than the USD one.

In dollar terms, no I cannot tell you.

As for whether slippage exists with Swift and nostro/vostro, I do not actually know. However I don't see why slippage would exist.

The idea of nostro/vostro is there is one entity that has assets and accounts in both countries (or perhaps different entities). Lets call them ACME bank. So you transfer $40,000 USD to ACME and they store it in their USD account. They then instruct their branch in Australia to send $50,000 AUD to the destination account. There's no actual slippage here because there's no market action occurring. Presumably ACME decides on the exchange rate based on the current market rates and agree this up-front with the customer for the transaction takes place (sending $50k AUD will cost you $40,132.52 USD right now, including all fees and exchange rate - do you agree to this price?).

It would be nice if this sub had more people with actual hands-on experience in banks doing these sorts of Swift transfers, but I've not really seen anyone claim to have hands-on experience.

>Asking for clarification, not confrontation. Appreciate your coherent posts.

5149,"Slippage literally only decreases as volume and order book depth increases. The whole point is that a single big transaction (hundreds k, or mils) shouldn't take a huge bite out of an exchange's book and move the price significantly if sold at 'market price', because if it does it means the buy or sell was done at multiple price points. There's no guarantee these will average out, actually, it's quite likely you'll lose money on both the XRP buy and XRP sell. It's like you going to tradeogre or crex, picking the cheapest shitcoin that is not completely dead, then buying and selling 50k$ worth. The price will look like a speedometer. It's the same for XRP but at a large scale.


Now consider that the exchanges also matter, it's a huge difference of whether you want to make that xRapid transfer between USD and KRW / JPY (relatively highly liquid even today) or XRP / VES where you'll probably cause huge movements with even a couple dozen grand.

For a small transaction such as the one in our example there is probably enough liquid assets in each account to just make the exchange happen.

I do think it's weird how Gottfried was still basically singing the same matra ""banks love our new API, they've *told us* they're happy with the current system, volatility, regulations, etc."" (which I would love to hear the end of this, you could almost hear how annoyed Brad was with that whole bs that 'banks don't like the volatility,' when fiat is 100x more volatile when we're talking huge sums and *days* versus seconds while simultaneously announcing partnership with R3/Corda; while you're right they don't *have to* use XRP or even Corda, (why partner with them?) SBI & R3 are heavily invested in XRP and it's **currently** the only asset that can act as settlement. (although R3 has noted that other assets will be accepted on Corda)

It just seems sort of bizarre to me. The only logical assumption I can make is that they may just have bad blood with Ripple and partnering with Corda will allow them to 'innovate' (via using XRP/Corda) but still maintain that this is a separate deal from Ripple and stay distanced from them even though if they fully implemented Corda it would be a boon for XRP and Ripple respectively as it would just create a much wider network for xRapid as well. (as Corda works seamlessly with the RippleNet/xRapid...)

I don't think this is an attempt to 'stall' bank adoption or even give them an opportunity to develop their own crpyto/blockchain mechanism. (That's like Blockbuster testing Netflix's streaming service, then attempting to create their own after Netflix already has the market; doing so is basically like saying ""yes Blockchain/Corda/xRapid is legit and well tested, but we can do it better...) I think the writing is on the wall and *most* likely SWIFT may just be allowing themselves time to ensure the Corda network can handle their existing volumes, etc. and when the time comes they can 'switch on' the settlement. It's playing cautious in a space where their entire payment model is facing a massive disruption-- they don't want to fall into obscurity, but also don't want to accept that they were outright wrong. R3 sort of allows them to save face a bit and stay relevant without giving too much ground to Ripple.

Either way I think this news is astronomically big for **XRP**; It wouldn't surprise me in the least if their R3 partnership leads to trialing Corda/XRP settlement and inevitably just full integration with their GPI/Corda/XRP settlement-- so they can claim 'with blockchain technology they now have instant settlement with their GPI,' without giving credit to Ripple. I dunno, this move just seems to strange to me if the 'trials' are successful that they *won't* move to settlement with Corda/XRP but allow banks to roll out the 'upgrade' at their own pace.",19-01-30-21-38,1,926,SpoonyDinosaur,albh5t

corporates using Corda will be able to authorise payments from their banks via gpi Link; gpi payments will be settled by the corporates’ banks, and the resulting credit confirmations will be reported back to the trade platforms via gpi Link on completion.

  Quote
David Rutter, CEO of R3, says: “Following the recent launch of our Corda Settler, allowing for the payment of obligations raised on the Corda platform, it was a logical extension to plug into swift gpi. Swift gpi has rapidly become the new standard to settle payments right across the world. All the blockchain applications running on Corda will thus benefit from the fast, secure and transparent settlement provided through the Swift gpi banks.”

griffdawwg 1 ~ 2 years account age. 80 - 150 comment karma.15 points 1 day ago

I think Gottfried brought up some valid concerns with regards to cryptocurrency and specifically XRP.

1.) Regulation- I think he's absolutely right that we won't see large volume going through XRP from banks until there is regulatory clarity, which I don't see happening anytime soon. There won't be regulatory clarity until they can't afford to ignore it anymore, and that won't be until there is regulatory clarity... Back to the chicken and the egg.

2.) Liquidity- Specifically, liquidity of XRP. This has bothered me for some time now. How can Ripple advertise on-demand liquidity with XRP when XRP isn't even the most liquid cryptocurrency, let alone fiat currency. The US dollar is incredibly more liquid than any crypto right now and XRP has very little volume passing through it, let alone enough volume to be useful for banks to use xRapid. The order books just aren't deep enough to handle bank transactions. I suspect this is why they targeted money transfer companies early on to bring more liquidity, but I don't see them bringing the liquidity required to compete with the liquidity of fiat currencies. Back to the chicken and the egg problem again.

All around great discussion by both sides, but it left me more concerned than not in the end.. And before you down vote me, how about you give me a valid counterargument for the two concerns I expressed above and we have a reasonable discussion?

1.) Regulation- I think he's absolutely right that we won't see large volume going through XRP from banks until there is regulatory clarity, which I don't see happening anytime soon. There won't be regulatory clarity until they can't afford to ignore it anymore, and that won't be until there is regulatory clarity... Back to the chicken and the egg.

2.) Liquidity- Specifically, liquidity of XRP.  This has bothered me for some time now. How can Ripple advertise on-demand liquidity with XRP when XRP isn't even the most liquid cryptocurrency, let alone fiat currency. The US dollar is incredibly more liquid than any crypto right now and XRP has very little volume passing through it, let alone enough volume to be useful for banks to use xRapid. The order books just aren't deep enough to handle bank transactions. I suspect this is why they targeted money transfer companies early on to bring more liquidity, but I don't see them bringing the liquidity required to compete with the liquidity of fiat currencies. Back to the chicken and the egg problem  again.

The R3 member banks involved in the trial include Barclays, BMO Financial Group, CIBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Macquarie Group, National Australia Bank (NAB), Natixis, Nordea, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Santander, Scotiabank, and Westpac Banking Corporation.
Rather than relying on nostro accounts to hold various currencies around the world, banks can enable real-time value exchange by using an independent digital asset. This blockchain-inspired alternative to correspondent banking provides on-demand liquidity and dramatically reduces associated costs.
David Rutter, CEO of R3, commented on the trial with Ripple:
“The tradition of holding numerous currencies across multiple accounts in different countries is costly and inefficient. This is a legacy issue from a time when the technology did not exist to offer a viable alternative; however, digital assets and distributed ledgers can now enable real-time exchange of currencies between parties anywhere in the world without the need for a third-party intermediary. This prototype paves the way for a major overhaul of how banks process and settle cross border payments.”",19-01-31-15-04,5,7,cryptojan,alljt4

XRP on its own would need to re-test and breakthrough the .35-.40 levels (i.e. create new higher highs on the daily charts) to get some bullish momentum. Right now, the pump is helpful but it's only regained the last 20 or so days of its own sideways and downward movement (tracking BTC). Personally I don't think the volume is anywhere like what it was in Oct to sustain a solid run up and hold it there on continuing good news/speculation independent of what BTC is doing (unfortunately). This means XRP will likely follow BTC down again - although possibly not by as much.

Apart from this new venture beween R3 and Ripple, which is highly likely to take huge market share, one way to create liquidity is that the banks themselves hold XRP. They didn't want to do that in the past, but it may change if a group of banks go together like the SBI CEO is predicting will happen this year (In many Asian countries there are no problems about holding XRP from a regulatory perspective, the same goes for Arabia, and perhaps Europe). Another way to create liquidity would be through a higher price for XRP. Ripple would have to stop selling XRP on exchanges and may have to burn some XRP for that to happen. Ripple could also start an incentive program where they release cheap XRP to banks while buying up XRP on exchanges to drive the price up. The important thing is to get the snowball to start rolling (which it has been). It will pick up speed eventually, but it could definitely need some nudging. Do you have any suggestions?

The only ways for the price to not climb when it 'should' are:

1. People aren't willing to sell at the price offered. So if you want the price to rise to $1, but no-one is willing to sell for less than $2, then it can't rise to $1. If no-one is willing to buy for $2, then it will stay where it is.

Edit: that said, I agree with you that Swift customers probably won't use XRP right away, nevertheless, the fact that SWIFT has caved to Blockchain and DLT is massive.

Thirdly, it's clear that you're cherry-picking your numbers or they're just flat-out wrong.

0.290395c was the price at 00:19:00 on Wednesday 30th Jan, GMT time. This was about 2 hours before the spike started. Your price of 0.286c was about the lowest price XRP has recently reached, a full day before the spike started happening.

My price is much more representative of what XRP was at pre-spike than yours.

Your peak price is pretty close to the figure I have (0.332987 vs 0.333 for you), but your price for when my comment was posted is wrong. My post was at 04:33 on Friday 1st Feb GMT time. This is 0.300572c.

When you use honest, accurate numbers, you will see I'm correct. Actually in doing this lookup again to prove you wrong, I found that the peak price was actually slightly higher than I quoted, at 0.333835, which means the price spike had retracted by 77% (actually 76.57%) at the time of my comment, not 76%.

Even using your calculation method (which is not appropriate for what is being discussed here - the degree to which the spike has been reduced), the actual calculation is that the spike was an increase of 14.67% followed by a decrease of 9.73% at the time of my posting - so about 2/3rds of the gain using your (flawed) calculation method was gone by the time of my posting.

6116,"Let's forget XRP, Corda, and Swift for a minute.  Imagine if you and your partner bank were sharing the same Google sheets file.  You are A and they are B...

A is in US and B is in Canada with different primary money.  In a month there are 10s of customer transfers between banks.  How would A and B record that in Google sheets?  At the end of the month, when the spreadsheet shows A owes B $30k USD and 10k CAD. B owes A nothing.  Think why and how A owed B.  It's because customers walked into A, made a deposit, then drove to B to withdraw or called family near B to withdraw.  The bills are physically gone from B and were physically deposited at A.

Now what?  If we go another month, A is likely to owe more and B is charging A interest daily.

At some point a truck of cash needs to be driven from A to B.  Does B in Canada want exactly 30K USD anad 10K CAD or do they want an exchange first?

XRP just replaces the truck, but can only send XRP, not USD or CAD.  It can send the value, but not hard bills.  Even if A and B use Ripple, Swift, and Corda all together, how will those bills the customers moved get from A back to B?

You can say they buy and sell bills from a 3rd party, but what if we call that third party C and C has the same problem to solve.

There are three problems and solutions that often get mixed up.  One is purly record keeping.  How do we make Google sheets in this scenario better?

Problem two is how do we settle and move value?  Trucks or blockchain.

Problem three is exchanging.  Each exchange is very expensive and involves moving the truck problem from you to someone else.  When you do that they take the physical money burden from you but charge you even more than their cost so your burden is higher than before you used the 3rd party service.  The price of assets during the exchange is set here at the exchange by you and your trade partner only.  The market prices are just guidelines to watch and consider, but the price you set to whatever you wish.  If it's too high, your partner simply won't take your offer.

Problem 4 is the network.  While XRP is just a ledger and value store, Ripple, Swift, Corda, and even Google Sheets are connected to many banks at once.  If A owes B, and B owes C, and C owes A all the same amount, that is a network to take advantage of.  They can all settle for free instead of sending three trucks or three XRP payments.  Thats much cheaper than exchanging too.

Either way, he still has a lot of XRP, but what he’ll be paying for 2 years, he could have gotten it all for 9 or 10 payments of the $500 per month I was suggesting.

In fact it's been going *up* against BTC over the last few months, even when you don't consider the last major crash when BTC essentially halved on value. That should already tell you something. These things happen slowly. To expect XRP to suddenly shoot up in USD and break away from BTC overnight is a little premature.

That leaves me trading in alt pairs. ETH seems to be on a slow decline against both BTC and USD, so I avoid that.

Until XRP becomes a true base pair on Binance, BNB is my base currency for trading.

These are all analogs to xCurrent, not xRapid.  Transferring parties still need to either A) accept foreign currency, B) have a nostro/vostro system that allows the transaction to take place at a set exchange rate, or C) expose themselves to exchange rate uncertainty while the transaction settles.

xRapid is a completely different beast.  It uses the speed of XRP and the liquidity of XRP in various currencies to settle a transaction with a pre-determined exchange rate in seconds.  If Corda Settler is capable of such a thing, none of the public information releases make that clear.

Your analysis needs to separate between short, medium, and long term outlook.  In the short term it looks good, but as you point out that's largely based on uninformed sentiment change.  In the medium term it may well be bad, as there is competition for xCurrent, which is supposed to be a gateway drug to xRapid.  But in the longer term, the fact that Corda Settler is doing its early testing with XRP may help with liquidity, which alongside updating regulation is the primary barrier to xRapid.  xRapid still stands alone as a service.

""C) expose themselves to exchange rate uncertainty while the transaction settles.""

What I'm referring to there is one or the other party receiving an IOU in a currency they don't want to hold, waiting to obtain that currency, and then trading that currency on the open market for the currency they want.  That is basically the ""no nostro/vostro"" version, and it takes days or weeks.  You are exposed to all kinds of exchange rate risk.  I don't think that's what you're referring to when you said:

""Using XRP via Corda Settler is C.""

Based on your more recent statement:

""I never said it wasn't nostro / vostro.""

maybe you actually meant it is B?  Whatever the case, a Corda Settler user will need to be using the N/V network or be willing to transact in a foreign currency (where ""foreign"" is inclusive of cryptos, basically, not their sovereign currency).  So it's not a settlement solution, really.  It's a messaging service like GPI or xCurrent.  It allows you to use XRP as a currency when you actually send that message, but we shouldn't confuse that with ""settling"" an FX transaction.  If both parties don't already want to work in XRP, someone somewhere still has to actually exchange one currency to another.  That is what xRapid accomplishes in a single bundle.

> My quote was in reply to your short/medium/long term paragraph - Swift GPI is well ahead of where xRapid is at, today, in terms of usage.

Gotcha.  I certainly don't deny that GPI and Corda Settler are competition for xCurrent.  They undeniably are.  But xCurrent isn't an XRP-based system.  From the perspective of an XRP holder it would be great if the whole world was on the RippleNet.  But a world in which GPI and Corda Settler were going their own way without any regard for Ripple or XRP would be much worse.  Because xRapid is the ultimate settlement solution (I'm not aware of a service anywhere that does what it does), the fact that the whole ecosystem is incorporating XRP is definitely a win.  It shows that they see the benefits of XRP as an functional asset and puts xRapid (or a similar service that uses XRP; XRP holders don't care) squarely on the roadmap for the future.  I could imagine a better situation for the XRP holder, but this definitely isn't a bad one.  That's why I think this development is a long-term win for an XRP holder.

But that's not how it works. They aren't comparable options at all.

You are a company in the US and you have to pay a company in Mexico some money.

If you have corda settler and it supports GPI, the choices are to use a transaction that automatically takes your USD and converts it into Pesos and sends it to the Mexican company - Swift's press release says that such settlements can occur in minutes or seconds, and that 50% of them settle within 30 minutes. Between USD and Mexico we should expect the transaction to take less than 30 minutes.

Or you can look up the current exchange rate for USD -> XRP, manually buy some XRP on an exchange (after you've signed up with KYC etc), convince the Mexican company to get an XRP wallet, and then you transfer the XRP to them. Corda Settler has an XRP oracle that snoops on the XRP ledger so it knows when the payment has gone through and updates Corda settler to say this. The Mexican company now has a wallet with some XRP in it (this part of the transaction was almost free and took less than 10 seconds). Now the Mexican company has to sign up to an exchange and sell their XRP for pesos.

That is literally the choice - between a system that automatically converts USD to Pesos, or one where both parties have to agree to use XRP and manually buy and sell it themselves, exposing themselves to volatility in the process.

6579,"**Decentralization**

Decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, economics, money and technology.

***

**Central bank**

A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and also prints the national currency, which serves as the state's legal tender.  Central banks also act as a ""lender of last resort"" to the banking sector during times of financial crisis.

I hold XRP and many more coins as vehicle of investment. So please read my thoughts with that objectivity I try to hold myself...

Let me share my thoughts, around why XRP is considered hateful and scammy.

&#x200B;

Supply:

Ripple / XRP has the ""pre-mined"" status, which is a red flag for many since btc were forked many times with pre-mined ICOs or btc forks. It was the basis for many Pump and Dump schemes. If the distribution is not ""fair"" by the cypherpunk ideology, it's likely to be considered a scam. Now it's arguable that the escrow and centralized supply (that is gradually being sold) is a mean for Ripple labs/XRP to be successful. But for some it's a repellent basis and red flag risk.

&#x200B;

Ideology, emotions:

Tribalism also surges from ideological and philosophical point of view. The level of it currently experienced is indeed fitting the term 'childish', but it's important to see that without such enthusiasm a new asset wouldn't remain standing. BTC indeed aspires to be the flagship of the ideology and economical concept of a standalone asset. It's going to be defended adamantly, to be the scarce resource, it's clear.

But let's consider ""XRPArmy"" is doing a big damage on the XRP agenda, countering the base emotions with similarly meaningless ""trolling"" ""shilling"". And it's in new heights since these stupid riddles of XY dollars by end of 2018 memes...

1. XRP ledger is centralised
2. XRP market cap is wrong and should be lower.

Based on these two arguments I gave my reply.

1. XRP ledger is desentralized in the sense that it is not owned by a single entity but agreement is reached by consensus of multiple participants. If those participants don't want to listen to you that does not make it centralised, you are free to build a list of participants that want to listen to you and validate transactions according to your view (a.k.a fork). This makes theoretically possible to ignore ripple validators if enough nodes agree to do so and even ignore their adresses.
Also software updates are voted by those validators so nothing would prevent you from carrying on maintaining the XRP Ledger as the source code is open sourced.

2. The article you linked presents an argument why XRP should not be listed as the second crypto asset by market cap by arguing that not the full supply of XRP is ""liquid"" because some of it is escrowed and also some individuals have undisclosed agreements on the rate at which they can sell them. My point was why on earth should that rule apply only to XRP when it is known or can be estimated in other blockchain the liquidity as well. That article is just cherry picking the rules to calculate market cap depending on the blockchain instead of using a rule for all.


>Running a ripple node is useless, because you cannot verify transactions unless others will opt you in. Because they get a list of trusted nodes from Ripple Inc.

Irrelevant for the auditing arguments as you can view the whole chain of transactions and also view the new ones.

Anybody thinking of selling everything out of frustration, I feel your pain. But this is business. It doesn't care how you feel. In fact, how you feel is so irrelevant,  that you'll be more successful doing the opposite of how you feel. Want to sell and get out? Better buy. Feeling fomo? Time to sell. 

Don't let the emotional side of your brain do your thinking. That's how you lose everything. Meanwhile, the logic side of your brain has some facts to offer. There's the fact that Xrp is the fastest, most eco-friendly, most easily adopted, and most secure asset out there. To quote Galgitron, ""it's a digital fucking fortress."" Then there's the fact that there are multiple companies like Ripple, Corda, and Coil that are all promoting XRP. These are companies that have vision, utility, and adaptability. And that's not even counting the other businesses that those companies are introducing to XRP! If these facts don't make you want to buy as much Xrp as you can because you are afraid of another 10-20% drop, then you're too emotional for this space.

We don't know what the price will do, so I'm just buying as often as possible with the money I don't need. No sense waiting for a dip or a rise. May as well just accumulate, and think in the time scales of years.

Thinking it’s going to go to zero overnight just because it lacks some next-level utility is short sighted IMO.  The internet still exists just the same way BTC will likely still exist in 10-20-30 yrs.  But I’m in it for what’s next, what has the potential to change the world and shake up entire industries globally, change nearly every person on the planet’s day to day life.  Like all those things that came because the Internet.   That may take time, and I’m fine with it.  Changing anything on a global scale takes time, I don’t care what anyone says.

The fact remains, right now, with crypto in its infancy, XRP has legit potential to completely revolutionize global finance and commerce for EVERYONE.  Sure maybe it won’t, but I find it incredibly unlikely BTC has a better shot.  Amazon was just another dot com back in the day, but one of the best and brightest ideas.  It lost 80-90% of its value, took some years to recover, and the rest is history.  I wish I’d bought some in 2000, and don’t think I’m alone there.

6891,"I recommend **everyone** read [this](https://business.financialpost.com/investing/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about). While crypto isn't a stock, the fact is it's operating exactly how the market intends it to. Very good insight on how buy/sell orders to hold prices down for as long as possible has been used since the 1930s-- the difference is crypto is a new space where it's pure speculation; this allows for a long period where investors can quite literally control the price before utility has any effect on relative value. The big run January 18th, 2017 and drop was done intentionally as huge bag holders could benefit tremendously and then sell for massive profits and then either exit the market or attempt to repeat the cycle.

We're still in *extremely* early and the market is very much control. Keep in mind Ripple and everything else hit ATH in January 2017; a huge spike largely from speculation and emotion. The market isn't stopping *Ripple* from continuing to build the ecosystem around XRP, isn't preventing them to just continue to grow; but it's going to take a **lot** of institutional volume before early investors will see a direct impact on price that can influence the price from *utility*, not just retail investment. Until that happens XRP will continue to be held down with the rest of the market. Regulations I think are a large reason we're seeing slow and steady adoption, however it's anyone's guess how long we have to wait-- as long as Ripple can continue to grow their partnerships and more institutions continue to utilize xRapid/Corda/XRP just keep your head down if you believe in what they're setting out to achieve. If they can continue to take out chunks of business from SWIFT, it will only further prove the value of xRapid/Corda. They are continuing to grow and unlike most other tokens, they don't *rely* on XRP sales. (While it's absolutely their goal to get people to move to xRapid, it's going to take time, but *everyone* already using it (besides maybe WU) have said nothing but positive things. This market is going to drive a lot of tokens that can't survive the bear market without investment which is honestly a *good* thing. Brad has mentioned that he thinks we're looking at 5 years before **mass** adoption of blockchain technology. He admitted he was quite off last year when he expected *more* institutional adoption, but regardless they are still growing and still getting partners actively using XRP. We're in a *tiny* bubble, and really it's impressive they already have xRapid customers despite it being production ready for less than a year.

If everyone holding XRP right now decided we weren’t going to sell an XRP for under $100, that would make the market cap 10 Trillion USD. $1,000 would make it 100 Trillion. This wouldn’t happen due to the way markets work, however its an easy explanation as to how a market cap is set. It doesn’t even remotely resemble how much money has been invested in it, but how much people are willing to pay for / sell it for. Many people seem to have yet grasp this concept.

Now why does XRP HAVE to be valuable? If Ripple succeeds in taking over the SWIFT system and handles the entire market of large volume cross boarder payments, the intrinsic value of XRP would have to be at the very least reflected in the market cap. CPSS (Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems) participating countries transfer around 8.4 Trillion dollars a day. Now is where I start to speculate. In my conservative estimated opinion, I would guess that financial institutions would want to keep at LEAST one days worth of transfers in XRP in their systems. Right now they have to hold a lot more money locked up in nostro/vostro because of the way the SWIFT system works over 3-5 days to guarantee the transfer. The XRP has to at least reflect the amount they need for the transfers. Banks can’t currently transfer $500 Billion of XRP in the next few hours because its simply not valuable enough, there isn’t 500 Billion dollars worth of XRP to transfer. By the very nature XRP **has** to be more valuable.

Assuming 1 days worth of 8.4T, would give 1 single XRP and intrinsic value of $84. And this would be if there were no investors in it and the banks held all of it. That's the *minimum* if XRP captured the entire market and the institutions held on to a days worth. Just think about that.

Now if other types of payment services involved XRP (Corda, apps like SendFriend, etc.) and we accounted for investors holding it, and we also know that financial institutions may hold more than that, these prices could be well over that. Do I think XRP will hit $200-$300 in the next 5 years? It's ultimately unknown, but the intrinsic value is much higher if they theoretically can capture a large portion of SWIFT, you see more Coil projects flourish like SendFriend, (which essentially just eliminates the need for Western Union, and while it currently is just a single corridor, they're working on opening it up) and then you factor in a new wave of FOMO, this time caused by *institutions* and utility; not just speculation, hype and emotion-- it may potentially bring back a lot of investors that either still haven't invested, or have left the market. Most retail investors that jumped in late in 2017 like yourself saw catastrophic losses and it's going to take **a lot** to bring them back-- speculation isn't going to work this time; if XRP can build enough utility to cause a intrinsic value (that can only go **up** once huge volume is created and tokens are being burned after every transaction) it can force a break away from the market; right now XRP just has a relative value to BTC and as long as there is money to be made from the pairing there's not a whole lot we can do.

Just hold tight. While the days of 100,000% increases (like the case of ETH going from $1 to $1,000+ in 12 months) I think are largely over, (which honestly that's just incredibly unrealistic and unhealthy for speculation to cause such a huge drive in price; the most successful IPO in history, [Ebay.com](https://Ebay.com) rose 1,000% in 6 months to put it in perspective how unrealistic the past gains have been. I think there is going to be a massive correction in the markets. Tokens that can't provide *actual* utility won't be around in a few years. (with the exception of some coins like BTC which may just be a store of value, but it's anyone's guess) We've never seen a token succeed at what Ripple is trying to achieve, (and largely succeeding) and it's doing something BTC and other PoW tokens have had a decade to try and achieve; get institutional investment/**actual** use- if they can continue to grow it may shake the entire market up and cause a huge shift in sentiment.

While you're not alone, and it stings to be sitting in the red and just 'waiting' you may be sitting on one of the best investments since Ebay or something and ultimately if Ripple/Corda just continue to build XRP use, the success is dependent on the price being higher. The bear market can only suppress it for so long. Personally I've stretched myself about as thin as I can; I would like to obtain more but don't want to get greedy, but I fully expect I won't touch it for 3-5 years at least barring some huge partnerships or Corda/xRapid adoption resulting massive retail/institutional FOMO. (which again, no token has been able to achieve that-- if Ripple/R3 is able to generate actual utility it's impossible to guess what affect that will have on the value, but one things for sure adoption of XRP may be what leads the way for legitimizing Blockchain and result in **real** money entering, not just retail investment. It's still a generally disliked token with a lot of intentional FUD being spread, but ultimately that won't matter if it's as widely adopted as they intend.",19-01-28-15-04,17,926,SpoonyDinosaur,akjo0k

Unless we go past all exchanges volume of 1 billion usd its difficult to predict the rates.

I know many guys will come in defense of XRP.

I am 100% invested in XRP. For me 2018 does not matter. It came and went. Lost opportunity but no use of crying over now.

We should talk about 2019.

In 2019 we need atleast $1 billion daily volume. At the moment CMC is showing us at $437 million & BTC as $6 billion. The gap is huge.

Plus as I said 2018 is history. Its 2019. We have achieved a lot. Lets see when we reach $0.5 & start stable cruise at $1. Just like we are tredging in $0.3 & 0.4 we need to cruise comfortably (stable) above $1.

And all of this needs to happen irrespective of market.

As much as I hate POW & BTC but I am afraid if it bloody falls to $2500 we will come sub $0.2 levels and this is where market will lose confidence.

6998,"Thanks for replying. Much appreciated. The age old divine mantra is the more the x-rapid use the more the price (jevon's paradox). This I have read here for two years now.

What I think is we are tied to the market. At the moment there is no correlation with the volume. Price is being defined by the market.

For day traders percentages (rise & fall) matters. They are not concerned (too much) about price. Its the hodlers that watch the price 24/7.

Having said this exchange volume (24 hr) needs to go up to $1 billion for starters in bearmarket or if we talk in percentage terms in healthy market then minimum 20% of the 24 hour market volume. That will be the signal of usage. I am talking about 2019 because many people here start talking about 2017 & 2018. Whats gone is gone. Current time matters.

7006,"No worries. The economics of it all are quite fascinating. But at the end of the day markets are going to be markets. 

XRP has utility for sure but that utility is currently underpinned by the markets willingness to speculate. xRapid relies on speculators to generate the liquidity needed to enable cross border payments. The hope is that lots more other successful uses of XRP will help to make the market even more liquid. I’m sure this will come with time.

The best that anyone can do to improve the longevity of XRP is to build applications that use it. The whole Jevons Paradox is a very interesting thought proposed by DS. But there is simply no way to know for sure if such a phenomenon will develop here.

7035,">What is going to motivate large banks to use XRP if they can already exchange money in other currencies?

Large banks already have capital parked all over. That is their business and revenue model. Its is the smaller to medium sized banks that are the main Ripple clients which are held to ransom by the larger correspondent banking relationships CBRs.

For them on-demand liquidity through XRP is the aim to cut down costs of moving money x-border. With XRP liquidity banks can cut costs of payment oeprations (FX exchange, currency hedging), nostro-vostro liquidity and claims/treasury operations. 

Apart from costs, there is the speed factor.

Even if banks want to still maintain CBRs, CBRs themselves have been moving out of emerging markets due to high costs. It is called de-risking.

They use it for the xrp ecosystem, not to fund ripple labs.

You don't have to verify anything from ripple but what they spent and if they spent it( which the reports and ledger are significant enough to do). The point is the report says it, you can go look at projects like ripple works, blockchain research with worldwide universities, donations to charity,  or the xpring projects yourself and see they are all legitimate(backs up by those movements on ledger). Hell ripple works has funded around 80 companies/projects alone in developing countries.

These are the public announcements made since xpring was announced several months ago.

This isn't stocks, a ton of this volume is still likely arbitrage. Its real volume, leading to real ledger movements which destroy xrp. Not to mention of that 500million xrp ripple sold, majority is OTC which can even have stipulations. It doesn't matter if xrp trade volume was only 100 million a day. 

Also maybe you should try to realize how markets work. You are discussing Mercury Fx's largest transfer so far of 4,500 in USD( it was GBP to peso). This does not dump xrp on the market. Mercury bought xrp in one market, and sold it in another. Doesn't matter that they don't hold xrp, as Market makers hold more xrp to  meet the demand.

Ripple would be idiots to raise venture capital (giving up shares) to finance operations, while having billions in XRP. They did that only in the beginning.

[They had 100+ customers end of 2017](https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-continues-grows-reaching-100-financial-institutions/). If they were pulling even $1bn/year I doubt they'd need to sell $500m XRP. Like, $1m/year is a good average salary, not everyone there is a superstar.

So if they have like $200m/year payroll and fund 5 startups for $100m (which is a lot), that still leaves a lot of money unaccounted for. Even more so if they are turning a profit.

If you knew how it worked, you wouldn't have said they dumped 5,000$ worth on the market with their xrapid transfer. 

500$ million in xrp is not a lot over the course of a year, plus that 500$ million went to the evolution of the network, driving more volume and demand.  It does not create a negative impact on the price, The actual movement from ripple to a company has no effect at all, and the selling stipulations work in a way where they can only use a small portion of that xrp over time.

Definitely one of your more 'cutthroat' articles; but amidst a few weeks of what feels like a *campaign* against Ripple/XRP with baseless misinformation and intentional FUD, I feel like it's been a strange wave. My theory is that while the community ultimately isn't maturing much, and this being a particularly brutal year for most investors, there's still a large number of investors hanging on to the 'dream' that PoW tokens will rise again, that BTC and other tokens will reach new highs again for no other purpose than they have before-- when the reality is it's had over a decade to provide something other than just being a token of relative value; I think we're largely seeing a shift with two camps.

The maximilists that *already* have a large stake in PoW coins are financially dependent on the volatility and keeping the 'speculation' and 'hype' alive, but as we're seeing that's starting to fall. It's a shame that so many investors *believe* in BTC for no other reason than it was first, when it's nothing more than a slow, wasteful 'store of value;' never mind the utility it fails to provide among all your other points.

The other group I think are those that bet big in late 2017 chasing huge gains, but again have no regard for the *technology of blockchain*. It's amusing to me whenever I visit other subs or /r/cc and the doom and gloom. My confidence in XRP hasn't changed, and it's unfortunate that it's still reacts to the market; but in such early stages it's the nature of a largely unregulated, speculative market. Ripple is changing that perception, and I think it's causing a lot of fear as they continue to gather more partners. (The amount of manufactured misinformation is bizarre and I don't think I've seen this with any other token before-- the *effort* to discredit it is unusual) 

They continue to have institutions begin to adopt xRapid despite all the negativity. I do feel that a huge market crash is imminent (and quite frankly, necessary) If BTC crashed to zero it would certainly hurt the crypto ecosystem and be the end of a lot of tokens, but I truly feel that if it doesn't happen *naturally* it will happen eventually as utility takes over speculation and retail investment. (Not to say BTC will, but I'm not sure if being a 'store of value' is enough when you have other tokens that are vastly superior in almost every regard, there just isn't any purpose for it other than currently it's primary tool use to buy other ICOs or other assets)",19-01-26-22-55,2,926,SpoonyDinosaur,ak0a2d

Why xrapid first? The reason is simple. A lot of people do not understand digital assets. Most digital assets do not offer anything of value. XRP has the opportunity to effect the way people send money and save money. If (a big if) Xrapid can successfully be implemented to the point where popular banks use it to offer almost free remits,  the crypto currency brand will change significantly. I see this happening but just an opinion. 

Bakkt will help with crypto branding but still won’t provide the reason as to why crypto will better average joe’s life. Sure, institutions will enter through Bakkt but nothing will take off unless real utility is easy to see. Has to be easy to see for everyone not just “institutions”.  Think dot com era. The telecomputer didn’t take off but the personal computer did. The industry thought the telecomputer was the future.... obviously wasn’t until years later when Microsoft came out with the PC. 

Samsung sells millions of phones worldwide. A secure wallet for digital assets will definitely help adoption. No one will use crypto to pay for things unless there is less volatility. Plain and simple. Who’s gonna buy a coffee from Starbucks with bitcoin when they can buy 2 coffees with the same amount a week later.

That could be interesting. 

Also mentioned in the article is NCB who are in talks with Riyad Bank for a similar exercise now. 

The implications of these are that significant operational savings will be expected which is obviously where XRP can add value. However, at a time of integrating two Banks, investing in new technology is always chlenging if done at the same time. Depending on the back end IT, it could take a while before Ripple's tech is used, but equally it could be an easy quick win.

Saab AB (originally Svenska Aeroplan AB, later SAAB and Saab Group; listen ) is a Swedish aerospace and defence company, founded in 1937.  From 1947 to 1990 it was the parent company of automobile manufacturer Saab Automobile. Between 1968 and 1995 the company was in a merger with commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania-Vabis, known as Saab-Scania. The two were de-merged in 1995 by the new owners, Investor AB. Despite the demerger, both Saab and Scania share the right to use the griffin logo, which originates from the coat of arms of the Swedish region of Scania.

Not to mention on sites like CMC, Jed’s xrp isn’t even considered circulating!! Ripple holds it thus CMC excludes it!

The problem is reports like this and sites use CS to manipulate prices. CS for bitcoin includes any asset that can be found on ledger regardless if its ever actually circulated,  if it’s in escrow/smart contracts,  in stipulations, owned by developers or companies, or lost. That same standard should be held for xrp. 

If they believe all those situations aren’t circulating supply, then bitcoin and eth also have inflated market caps at as well.

Market cap literally includes every asset even assets restricted from the public or involved in selling stipulations. CS is used in crypto for assets not mined yet(nothing about them actually circulating). Assets without mining shouldn’t even use CS, or at least hold bitcoin to the same standard about btc owned by developers and locked in smart contracts/lost. ",19-01-26-15-04,2,3456,mikenard77,ajxivs

I believe the xRapid ""fingerprint"" is different during these early stages. I would really like to find some quantitative evidence that it is operating out there, in the wild. I don't think we will see a direct increase in payments volume or count yet. To put the post's figure above in perspective, one first needs to limit the scope to inter-exchange Payment transactions only. These are just a tiny fraction of all Payment transactions at the moment.

I made some sleuthing recently. It is far from finished, but perhaps I can share some initial results. 

&#x200B;

What I did so far (long story short):

* made a list of all XRP addresses I could find for the following exchanges: Bitstamp, Bittrex, Bitso and Coins.Ph
* performed a query to obtain all inter-exchange payment transactions
* [visualized the data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matej.horvat#!/vizhome/xRapid/View1), Ledger Close time on X, Payment Amount on Y, and using color to indicate the exchange pair
* played around in this visualization, looking for any clues
* I've noticed a set of pecuilar bursts of transactions happening from Bitstamp -> Coins.Ph, or Bitstamp -> Bitso, where very similar amounts (small, \~ 20-50 XRP) are transferred within a short time-frame in subsequent transactions. The amounts are never an integer and they vary a little bit (less than 1%).
* Such bursts of small-amount transactions appear more and more often after October 2018, when xRapid should have been going live (there are some isolated bursts evident also before this time, but only on Bitstamp -> Bitso trafic; testing perhaps?)
* Based on this I've made another query, calculating the minimum difference in Amount and the minimum difference in Ledger Close Time between a transaction and it's neighbouring transactions (with this query I am able to single out the peculiar bursts I've observed)
* You can see the results [here in this second visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matej.horvat#!/vizhome/xRapid/View2); for best results use the filter to only show the Bitstamp->Coins.Ph traffic

I'm not sure yet about what I'm seeing, but could this be the way xRapid works, but carefully checking the current liquidity status and breaking down a single payment in multiple exchange transactions to limit the impact? Or is it just that these remittance companies are performing these transactions (in similar amounts and within a fixed time window, that is separate remittances but one after the other?

I forgot about the destination tag. In this case of Bitstamp->Bitso transaction, the Bitso destination tag is 25490962. If this setup has not changed, this could allow tracking transactions to Bitso (presuming the same exchange account is set up for xRapid as was used during the demo).

>Cross-border remittances are far from costless. On average, the charge for sending $200 – the benchmark used by authorities to evaluate cost – is $14. That is, the combination of fees (including charges from both the sender and recipient intermediaries) and the exchange rate margin typically eats up fully 7% of the amount sent. It is less expensive to send larger amounts, with the global average cost of sending $500 at just under 5% (World Bank 2017b). Even so, the aggregate cost of sending remittances in 2017 was about $30 billion, roughly equivalent to the total non-military foreign aid budget of the US!

Second how do you “re-key” after you buy someone’s wallet?
Third why would you buy a wallet unless it was being sold for less than 20 XRP and how would you pay for it ? With nano?

Saying it isn’t a fee because one day they may let you reclaim it isn’t really all that great of an argument. 

The nano wallets cost nothing to set up. Cost nothing to use. And I don’t have to sell my old wallet to someone to start a new one or leave nano behind when I do so. A heck of a lot simpler. ",19-01-25-05-40,1,917,DavidScubadiver,ajfip2

You could easily find someone online to sell a key to. It’s beneficial to both User who doesn’t need it and the buyer who does as the seller could be profiting or getting their original reserve back in dollars , while the buyer could be getting a deal as that price may be less than the market rate for 20 xrp today. Many buyers could also take the option to help avoid the ledger from getting to large, as well as the incentive of getting it cheaper than the market rate. 

You could pay for it with cash in person, PayPal, cash app, BTC, nano, LTC, possibilities are endless....

it’s not a fee. You don’t pay it and it’s gone, you still hold the asset and the account holds that asset(it’s more like a conditional escrow). Over the long term as the price of xrp grows and stays at that growth, validators vote to lower the reserve....",19-01-25-05-40,1,3456,mikenard77,ajfip2
7591,"actually they sold 535m in 2018, 0.24% of quarterly volume( which is roughly equal to XRPs DAILY VOLUME, not to mention it was OTC, and the OTC market is estimated to be 5x the daily market trade volume). So yeah they sold 535m in 2018, but the market buys and sells that much DAILY! The volume for ripples xrp sales was .006% of the global yearly market volume. A drop in a ocean, plus majority of it was sold OTC it has no negative sell pressure on the market. (large purchases come with selling stipulations that are volume contingent so they are always in correlation to the markets growth). Ripple doesn't sell xrp at a discount so partners can use it for transactions, they use selling stipulations for sales under market value( assuring utility will be used to effect price)

Ripple the company is funded by software, and venture capital( google, santander, etc They have had like 7 rounds so far). The funds from the xrp they sell goes to the ecosystem in forms of blockchain research, development, liquidity( funding market makers etc), xpring( 100+ companies building on the xrp ledger), ripple works(over 80 projects in developing countries), and the accelerator program(rebated for institutions using xrp and xrapid).

Also this DOES NOT dilute supply as all XRP already exist. The supply is known, it doesn't matter if some is in a smart contract or not. They are all held by someone already. Its simply ripple moving xrp from their wallet to another persons....Customers aren't using these large OTC buys for transactions, ripple assures that with selling stipulations, as it would hurt their bottom line as well ( every 2 cents xrp drops they lose 1 billion$)

2. ""Ripple Q4 sales accounted for 0.24% percent of global XRP volume"". In general, this means that Ripple's XRP sales are only a TINY fraction of the total XRP that are sold in the market which means that it has no impact on the price.
3. The supply is already known. The total supply is (almost) 100B, everybody knows that. Circulating supply is just an ""invented"" term which doesn't mean a thing when it comes to XRP. There are 100B XRP, end of story.

I’ve been tracking BTC vs. XRP and BTC+ETH vs. XRP daily and it’s held steady over the last 4 months.

7779,"So, two points, the first is that you say xRapid aims to ""eliminate"" the bid/offer spread.  I would say it aims to reduce it.

This is important to understand the motivations of market makers.  Market makers are incentivized to participate in a market with a smaller bid/offer spread if the volume is there.

Making $1 a trade a million times is better than making $10 a trade 10,000 times.

I think this is a big point that people who think market makers are going to be frightened off by smaller spreads are missing.

Second point is that out of the two big issues of illiquid markets, higher spreads and slower speeds, I think that the one banks are mostly suffering from is slower speeds.  Banks' clients don't understand why a bank transfer can take days in a digital age, and to feed their desire for quicker and quicker transactions, banks are having to lock up more and more money in tools like nostro accounts to bridge the gap, which amounts to lost business.   

Even if the spread in XRP (like all cryptocurrencies) is larger than in traditional FX markets, it can _still_ be cheaper than FX, due to the increased speed resulting in less loss of business.",19-01-25-15-04,1,6500,thekiyote,ajl64h

No, they can’t do whatever they want with it. Any released XRP Ripple receives from Escrow is considered “unfinished” if it isn’t sold to a third party, and the release from Escrow would be cancelled and returned. It isn’t up to Ripple, it is completely dependent on the demand for XRP. They don’t choose to put it back into Escrow, it’s in the rules of their wallet. This is how XRP remains decentralized. A fixed amount is released monthly. This amount was initially up to Ripple, but it cannot be altered, so they don’t control the release.

7860,"Very interesting panel. I do think a lot of people underestimate *just how early* we're in this-- Ripple already has *live* institutions *using* XRP which is pretty incredible for how infant the market is. However it will take complete regulatory clarity and understanding before we'll see the complete vision of the 'internet of value' being demonstrated. While it's going to take thick skin to hold through the market maturing, I do think 3-5 years is a good estimate to when it will be rather ubiquitous in industry. (If you've never heard  Glenn Hutchins before this guy is great and you can tell he has a lot of faith in Ripple; he's mentioned many times that while a lot of people got burned during the dot com, if you were one of those who bet big on Amazon, etc. early and held through the slow/volatile growth, you'd been in pretty spectacular shape today) If Ripple is able to transform (or take over a large portion of SWIFT) There's no telling how that will impact the token's value. (This doesn't even factor in Coil/Codius and the large potential there) We've never seen a token that has a price based on utility, it could be a gigantic entity if they continue to just build partnerships and xRapid usage organically over the coming years. While Brad is staying 'long on BTC' as a store of value, most alts can't rely on that forever. It's unhealthy for the ecosystem when an entire industry lives or dies by the value of BTC. **Utility** will eventually build the ecosystem. (in fact I think we're already starting to see that take place)

I honestly think the days of 100,000% returns or more from hype/speculation/emotion (FOMO) are largely gone; there may be some surprises, but we saw the ultimate result of that in 2017... as the panel brought up there was a huge rush (I really liked the comparison that during the dot com era, everyone was just putting '.com' at the end of their start-up but there was no clear *vision*\-- we're seeing that with blockchain again. I mean don't get me started on the amount of weed related tokens with pot acronyms or things like '[Long Blockchain Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Blockchain_Corp.)' that are just riding the hype/technology but have no *focus* on solving problems or even have the *intention* of providing utility) Ripple has been meticulous in distancing themselves from cryptocurrency and even blockchain-- instead they are a enterprise software company for fintech solving **real problems** using the technology. (and no doubt solving those problems with XRP is their ultimate goal, xCurrent/xVia are merely corridors to bring the technology to partners while staying away from the current general stigma/maturity of cryptocurrency)

However as other panelists also agreed on, Blockchain *isn't* going anywhere, but we're moving away from the speculation phase. Really early retail investors (pre-2016 and earlier) that made out like bandits did it all before institutional involvement-- most early traders that got extremely burned buying in near ATH are long gone and likely won't return barring some shift in the market; it's going to take more than hype to move things and bring the market to maturity. I think in 5 years time we'll see a fraction of tokens with substantial value (and I believe XRP will be among them) but it's not feasible to have 2k+ tokens all fighting to solve problems that don't exist. Ripple has provided a solution to a *very* specific problem, but blockchain can change the landscape of many industries, it's just a matter of it actually happening. But I do see a possible future where XRP makes a *lot* of people rich; it's just a matter of if you can wait for more banks to adopt xRapid/Corda, projects to flourish on Coil, Xpring, etc. I fully expect we'll potentially see some incredible gains, but I don't anticipate it until it's built enough institutional backing to bring back retail (or really, even hedge/business) FOMO. The more XRP can become independent and generate volume from utility, the less control the market will have on being able to control price. Plus in the scheme of things 2024 isn't *that* far away, especially if that means I'm basically retiring in mid-late 30s lol. (Remember the .dot made a **lot** of people filthy rich, I expect blockchain will do that as well, and this time it won't be because of speculation/luck, but because it's actually providing utility and **worth** the value instead of just holding relative value to BTC which is traded no differently than a commodity)

If you don't believe it, remember if you're here, you're someone that's in a bubble *inside* a bubble; the average investor likely still couldn't tell you much, if anything about blockchain and if they can, probably not much more than 'knowing' about BTC. (and it's likely not going to be anything positive) This is the nature of anything disruptive however; there's going to be tremendous misunderstanding, misinformation, speculation, etc until someone can 'break the mold' and deliver, and we've largely seen Ripple start to do something BTC and other PoW tokens haven't been able to do in over a decade; generate institutional utility and use. There's a *lot* of growing pains left, but if you believe in the fundamentals of what Blockchain, and namely Ripple are out to achieve, you could be hedging the next big industry since the .com era. I think there will be many winners yet, but Ripple is the only one that has such a laser focus on a specific industry and continues to gain partnerships despite the bearish ecosystem and immature/tribal market.",19-01-24-04-20,66,926,SpoonyDinosaur,aj2090

I don't see any significant 'advantage' if you aren't already [partnered](https://www.r3.com/ecosystem/) with R3 over Ripple; they both provide a very similar service, I think in the case of R3 it's more that they already have a huge partnership list that can now use XRP as a form of settlement-- While R3 and Ripple are actually *technically* 'competing,' the competition is extremely good for further XRP adoption. R3 is just bringing more institutions onto the RippleNet which is good for Ripple and XRP and xRapid/xCurrent can work directly with the Corda Settler interchangeably. As far as I'm aware though Ripple is the only one with institutions *actively* using XRP/xRapid-- Corda allows their partners to connect to the network if they choose.

They created xcurrent to help solve the chicken and egg problem for xrp because the trick was getting banks to adopt a tech that could only settle some of their payments at first. Corda does the same thing, as it allows banks to use xrp when they can (for example when another bank accepts it or there’s a payment path that uses it ) without relying on a new payment system to do it.

Contrary to what you have been told, the MTC GOX debacle is a massive win for altcoins. As far as I understand (thanks to [u/fadzter](https://www.reddit.com/u/fadzter)), each claimant will receive around 17% of their claim in BTC and the rest in cash  (around $600 x their btc claim). In other words, if you have 10 btc with MtGox at the time of the collapse, you will get: 1.7 btc and $6000 cash ($600\*10).

Overall this is a large positive for the altcoin market because there will be no new supply of altcoins, but new demand from early adopters that will log into their cryptowallets and accounts for the first time in years.

""Digital Token"":

The term ‘digitaltoken’ means a digital unit that—is created— in response to the verification or collection of proposed transactions;

pursuant to rules for the digitalunit’s creation and supply that cannot be altered by a single person or group of persons under common control; or

That's not the only downside for the United States and it's citizens. Even if a startup in the cryptocurrency space isn't located in US, doing business with someone in the US means they must follow US regulations as well. Not wanting to deal with it, they've ignored the country entirely.

8262,"Long reply I wrote in the comment section to Hodor's new blog post:

\---

Let me help out on that, as simple as I can:

* The value of XRP will rise with increasing demand. Why? Imagine the situation today, there are 40 billion XRP in circulation at about 0.3$ per XRP. This means the biggest transaction you could possibly make today would be around 12 billion $ and only if you would be able to own all XRP in circulation to be able to send it in one transaction. As of today, this is more than sufficient, because barely any FIs are using XRP, utility as of today is basically still not existent. That's today.  
\-  
Now imagine the future, yes, maybe all 100 billion XRP will be released by that time, so higher supply out there. But still, imagine thousands of XRP transactions going on every day, worth trillions of $ (estimations of SWIFT handling about 5 trillion $ worth of transactions daily out there), all across the globe.  
\-  
Not all of the supply will be available at any given time, every second new transactions will come up requiring their share of XRP to be processed, spread across multiple continents, countries and markets. One day has 86,400 seconds, SWIFT is handling more than 20 million transactions per day, so even the fast settlement time of a few seconds with XRP is not fast enough that at any given time all XRP would be available for a new transaction.  
\-  
The price will react by increasing, because otherwise transactions would start to be delayed as they have to wait for XRP to be released from ongoing transactions again, even when settlement time is super fast. The more value one XRP holds, the less XRP is needed for your transaction to go through. So with increasing transaction volume, demand for liquid XRP will constantly rise and **the only** variable that can scale to cope with the growing demand and to prevent delays is the price, as the total supply is limited to 100 billion and even getting less as with every transaction a small amount of XRP is burned.  
\-  
Hope that helps a bit, I could not make it any shorter than that. 😅  

* FIs can buy from escrow for now as Ripple is trying to onboard new partners and they probably get a much better deal as if they would buy from an exchange right now, so it is a business incentive that Ripple can give out for early adopters, which makes sense.  
In the long run, there won't be an escrow to feed FIs from anymore, it will all be circulating supply so any FI participating in the XRP ecosystem (or also any other stakeholder for the different XRP use cases out there) will source from exchanges.

Hope that helps, happy for anyone to correct me if something I am saying is not making sense. That is my own understanding. 😊

If banks end up using their own XRP for bank to bank XRP tranfers, without utilizing immediate FIAT exchange, they will still be burning up XRP. Also they own/are hodling the reserves, which decreases supply, which increases demand. I see

Sure but that wouldn’t be xrapid anymore. It would be using ripple net with xrp. For example right now an FI can send xrp to another ripple net member, and they complete the payment in the needed currency. No need for external exchange volume. One can even pay another member fiat, and they can complete a payment to another bank in xrp, and they finish the payment in the needed fiat. Other banks can even pay other members to use xrapid for them.... it really all comes down to what the best payment path is.

We may disagree on how bullish 2019 and beyond may end up being but I really think it's important for long-term crypto investors to consider two questions:

&#x200B;

Is it ok if your crypto holdings stay down in price? (y/n)

Is it ok if your crypto holdings stay sideways price? (y/n)

&#x200B;

If you answer no to either of those questions, you may be risking more than you can afford to lose and crypto may not be for you.  It is fine to be optimistic but I would caution those that jump in and those that stay (by buying more) to think critically about their financial decisions. **I can only encourage caution,** although you may encourage a bullish approach to the upcoming year.

8336,"Let me help out on that, as simple as I can:

* The value of XRP will rise with increasing demand. Why? Imagine the situation today, there are 40 billion XRP in circulation at about 0.3$ per XRP. This means the biggest transaction you could possibly make today would be around 12 billion $ and only if you would be able to own all XRP in circulation to be able to send it in one transaction. As of today, this is more than sufficient, because barely any FIs are using XRP, utility as of today is basically still not existent. That's today.  
\-  
Now imagine the future, yes, maybe all 100 billion XRP will be released by that time, so higher supply out there. But still, imagine thousands of XRP transactions going on every day, worth trillions of $ (estimations of SWIFT handling about 5 trillion $ worth of transactions daily out there), all across the globe.   
\-  
Not all of the supply will be available at any given time, every second new transactions will come up requiring their share of XRP to be processed, spread across multiple continents, countries and markets. One day has 86,400 seconds, SWIFT is handling more than 20 million transactions per day, so even the fast settlement time of a few seconds with XRP is not fast enough that at any given time all XRP would be available for a new transaction.  
\-  
The price will react by increasing, because otherwise transactions would start to be delayed as they have to wait for XRP to be released from ongoing transactions again, even when settlement time is super fast. The more value one XRP holds, the less XRP is needed for your transaction to go through. So with increasing transaction volume, demand for liquid XRP will constantly rise and **the only** variable that can scale to cope with the growing demand and to prevent delays is the price, as the total supply is limited to 100 billion and even getting less as with every transaction a small amount of XRP is burned.  
\-  
Hope that helps a bit, I could not make it any shorter than that. 😅

&#x200B;

* FIs can buy from escrow for now as Ripple is trying to onboard new partners and they probably get a much better deal as if they would buy from an exchange right now, so it is a business incentive that Ripple can give out for early adopters, which makes sense.In the long run, there won't be an escrow to feed FIs from anymore, it will all be circulating supply so any FI  participating in the XRP ecosystem (or also any other stakeholder for the different XRP use cases out there) will source from exchanges.

*ELI5 version:*

Think of cryptocurrency as oil right now; there are shares, stocks, currencies, commodities, gold/silver, etc.

But back to oil. Now there are different oils actually, each has its own price-- Dubai, North Sea, Brent... every one differs in quality, distance to the markets, costs of shipping, etc. Despite XRP being one of the highest quality oils on the market, it's ***still*** **just oil**. When there is a trade war somewhere the price of oil goes up and when there is a recession, oil prices go down. **All oil, not just one.** This is the same currently with cryptocurrencies-- it doesn't matter right now which one is 'best' as they are *all just cryptocurrencies* right now. There is a 'relative value' by default between any two products on the market, an exchange rate between all products if you will. For example *(totally random numbers)* 1 kg of gold = 1000kg of tomatoes = 140 chickens, etc.

Okay well cryptos aren't commodities right? Well sort of yes-- they are currently **just** a store of value, and traded as such. As long as there is money to be made trading in the pairing of BTC-XRP or BTC-anything, all coins will go down or up based on relative value.

XRP is **just** beginning to build volume from **utility** not just relative value, but it will take time, or as Brad would say ""the switch needs to be flipped;"" Right now **retail** investors rule the roost as Blockchain is still building institutional value. When that happens and XRP's escrow begins sell out due to utility each month, it won't matter what the relative value is, the value will be determined by utility and volume. In a nutshell *very* little volume is being created by institutions, so while we see positive headlines it's still mile 2 or 3 of a marathon; price is currently tied to 'relative value' rather than 'utility.'",19-01-21-23-17,1,926,SpoonyDinosaur,ai9la9

And then I’m thinking, early addaptors can buy large ammounts from the escrow for lower prices, then When the market goes up, sell it with profit and that will lower the market prices. Despite the trust I have in Xrp’s use, I do understand that new investers or the other crypto lovers point at this situation. Its not really fair. 

Yes, offcourse they can make agreements not to sell it, but still FI’s have large amounts of Xrp at low prices, therefore a head start of private investors. Is that fair?

I do appreciate that once again, we have brought ourselves to openly discuss exchanges.

It is indeed impossible for exchanges to remain completely secure. I think it is not out of question for them to be required to hold an insurance policy on their assets on a 1 to 1 ratio.  Of course, since the crypto insurance market is limited, the next best thing, in my opinion, would be requiring exchanges (both fiat and non-fiat) to hold a 1 to 1 ratio of hot assets to cold assets.  This is almost the opposite idea of fractional reserve banking but it puts the end users first, and hacks would have limited impact, in theory.  This may seem like a punishment but this idea is wholly pragmatic at its core, if you look at it from an owner/operator's perspective with lower risk and legal liabilities. The 1 to 1 ratio may also be considered for non-crypto assets backing crypto, to lower the risk even further. I think 1 to 1 is consistent with the ideals of the crypto community. I would be interested if any exchanges take their foot off of the greed gas pedal and look into something more responsible in the future.

Appreciate the intelligent discussions as of late, @hodor7777.

Or Ripple will. You shouldn't assume that Ripple will destroy SWIFT, just because it's best for your back pocket that they do so.

Ripple could end up just being a niche also-ran player, stuck in small-volume remittances. You have no idea what the future holds. The FED could come out with FED-Coin in order to realise their 24/7 real-time settlement process, and that could go on to replace Ripple's use case.

If SWIFT really do see the writing on the wall, it's in their best interests to partner with Ripple, not compete.

Of XRP ledger, therefore inviting higher demand for XRP, which benefit us as initial digital asset investors/hodlers. 2. We need to continue our support for XRP as a currency, continue to drive prices up, which gives liquidity on the network. 

Ripple would be 5 years behind the curb if the ONLY value was institutional and not speculative. imagine xrp was $.005 still. If you were a business and had to utilize 2,000,000 xrp to send a $10k payment. 
That would be 1/20,000th of the entire circulating stock at the time (~40billion)

As a small financial institution, I would be terrified that there would not be enough liquidity, not enough of the asset, especially if xrp were being handed to the institutions for pennies on the dollar, what would give it value? It wasn’t created as a private utility token that only had value related to what ripple deemed it to be. It’s a public currency 

This, as far as I know, is the story of all currencies. USD needs reasons why it’s valuable. Banks to manage it, utility cases, backing of government, store of wealth cases, meaningfulness to other countries. but imagine if the Public did not use USD! Ripple needs us to use xrp, they need speculation. We need them to moonshot it, so there was a reason for our investment.

I didn’t mean to have a harsh tone, if it seems so. I am open to discussion or being proved wrong if you see it differently.

Most of us are expecting to wake up one day and see a parabolic rise in XRP. Possibly from regulatory clarity, possibly from a domino effect of major instructional adoption, a statement from the IMF, crossover from speculation to use case appreciation etc.

I am beginning to wonder if the rise might be a bit more slow and steady. Ripple is on-boarding companies to Xrapid where they can, in areas with regulatory clarity. We are seeing snap shots of use, but not enough to move the price. I am wondering if this is a foreshadowing of how things will go at first when major institutions come on.

I know personally I had this idea in my head that the SEC would make the declaration (*opinion) that XRP is not a security, all the guys at the firms on xcurrent would spit out their coffee, get on the horn and yell “flip the switch!” Instantly using Xrapid and causing the price to go bonkers. 

But maybe not...Let’s be prepared for the possibility that things may continue at a slow and steady pace even with such great news. Some major firms have indicated they have tested XRapid  but this was likely done internally. It’s a different game when it is for real. It’s very possible that when they finally do come on board they start out playing small ball, moving only a bit at a time so they can build confidence. 

This is all to say that if that parabolic ascent doesn’t happen as soon as we get some or all of the major news coming, don’t despair. Speculation has given us a glimpse of major movement but utility will ultimately carry us through. In order to see that happen though, we need to see financial institutions make a major shift in the way they do business. They won’t do that at the drop of a hat.

If XRP is successful and widely adopted it decreases a few very big American bank's revenue streams such at Citi and JP Morgan who help provide liquidity for smaller banks in international payment flows and charge fees on doing so. Right now the USD is the world reserve currency and many countries have to go through the US dollar when transferring between some other fiat currencies. It doesn't take a masters in economics to realize the success of XRP could be very bad for the global demand or need of the US dollar. I think that maybe these same regulators that Ripple is working with are also getting pressure from the other side  of the coin with big banks revenue streams being threatened and XRP possibly being very bad for the US dollar and presumably the US economy as a whole. I don't think they are discovering new things about the tech today that they didn't know yesterday I think they realize the potential this has for the globe and also the potential it has to affect the US dollar and they are still trying to figure out how to best approach it.

Thinking this way, though, does help me keep my finger off the trigger and be a bit more thoughtful when considering injecting more money into market.

This sub is far from a kool-aid circle jerk, infant many people causing hype get called out. It seems like you are here to spread misinformation and calling a sub you are also in that, makes it look like you have ulterior motives.

The reality is xrp is up 9,000% in 22 months, 100% in the last 14. Last time assets like bitcoin,eth,and ltc were this low xrp was .17. This is crypto, its how the market moves, especially when the worn out speculation volume is 50x the utility volume at the moment. I seen your other comment about how the market will not make big gains anymore, didn't you notice the 30% run several weeks ago, 100% a few months ago? This is how crypto moves, due to its multidimensional and liquid nature. Its a technology first and foremost....

Using xrp directly without xrapid, has little direct effect on short term market price and no effect on exchange volume. Even in the billions. WE see hundreds of millions moved all the time on ledger. Huge banks aren't going to adopt xrapid( and some may never) right now, its target group is SME's. Large banks would use xrp directly at this time(and many have tested it, so to say they aren't using it is ridiculous).

Your statements in this thread are a perfect example of why the solution being put into place via Xrapid is so crucial.  You're exactly right.  Business owners are conducting their business in response to in the inflexibility of money, when in fact money should be able to move in real time. If you are able to move money in real time for virtually free, you wouldn't structure your business around the inflexibility of money.  So, while your point is taken that there probably is not a linear relationship present here, it neglects the effect having agile, easily transferrable and immediately settled funds would have.  Personally, in my realtively small business, I move a lot of money and all over the place. If I could do it cheaper, I would do it much more often and it not such a structured manner for precisely the reason you mention; I am presently bound by restrictive limits and settlement times.",19-01-18-02-33,3,4198,Lysistrada,agywdr

Correct - the speed is the same in your example.

A border barrier is a separation barrier that runs along an international border. Such barriers are typically constructed for border control purposes such as curbing illegal immigration, human trafficking, and smuggling. In cases of a disputed or unclear border, erecting a barrier can serve as a de facto unilateral consolidation of a territorial claim that can supersede formal delimitation.

Examples of border walls  include the ancient Great Wall of China, a series of walls separating China from nomadic empires to the north.

I don't agree with you, first of all MM is ""a liquidity provider."" If you have a bit more XRP than a regular trader (around 30BTC in XRP) and if you would like to sell it in bulk than you cann't crash the market because there are a people(MM) who signed the agreement and they must to keep a certain spread. So if someone in Bank A want to send a big amount of money to Bank B through xRapid and an exchange will haven't MM, what do you think what the price will?

If the price of XRP isn't influenced largely by the team achievements, so what is influenced on the price? If the team didn't work hard we haven't saw a great products like xCurrent, xRapid and xVia.

Ripple provides products using XRP, but Ripple is not equal to XRP.  XRP is decentralized and is not only used by Ripple. Ripple is not ‘responsible’ for other wallets than their client’s wallets. 
I think you could compare it to ‘airmiles’ which you can collect by buying at several stores. The stores support and use the airmile service but do not control the ‘airmile’ wallets. The stores do not own the airmile service. Ripple has a lot of XRP but does not own XRP. If Ripple would go bankrupt , XRP still works, so no risk that Ripple wallets would stop working.

R3 is a large company with a large customer base that uses XRP in one of their products but other companies use XRP as well. Ripple control 4% of validators. If Ripple disappears tomorrow, XRP will still continue to exist. This has been communicated several times by Ripple themselves, that it's clear that XRP is not a security. It is simply FUD spread by players trying to slow down Ripple and XRP for whatever reason. The whole security debate around XRP is a joke. ",19-01-15-15-06,10,1,mr_lazy85,ag4i7i

“It all started with Graud, the first Homo Neophilius. He was an Atlantean scientist and philosopher, and invented the concepts of Good and Evil. Before then, all Atlanteans lived in a pseudo-hedonistic society that was more interested in the practical side of life, but Graud and his followers believed that there was a way that things should be, and that people who were against it shouldn't be (existing, that is). So, because of this, they fought a massive civil war--another invention of Graud's--that resulted in the destruction of Atlantis.”

9833,"I disagree that it is a joke.  There are merits to the argument.  XRP does not meet the full definition of a security by a long shot.  Crypto & digital assets in general have sparked a lot of debate that show us the archaic system of defining securities from the 1930's is not relevant for this tech.  What will most likely happen is there will eventually be an entirely new asset class with it's own set of regulations that have the best of both worlds (i.e protection for investors, and allowing for innovations).  

I'd even argue the more important piece of all this will be the IRS for the US.  If the SEC defines a new asset class and the IRS mandates it is taxed the same as a security via capital gains, the IRS just wrecked any chance Xrapid would be useful in the US.  I'm concerned about the IRS.  Younger people are not signing up to work for the IRS meaning innovative thinkers may not be very prevalent in the organization.  Not to say some older folks may not be open minded, but in my experience, the older generations tend to disregard crypto without much thought.  This mixed with the fact the government keeps slashing the IRS's budget could create a situation where the IRS simply treats it like a security as far as taxes are concerned.  Fortunately ( for XRP) this would really hurt the US more than XRP.  XRP would suffer in the short term, but other countries are adopting.  If the US gets left behind because it cannot get out of its own way, then so be it.  ",19-01-15-15-06,1,1403,Vengefulseven,ag4i7i

9995,"A payment journey with xRapid looks like this: a financial institution connects directly to digital asset exchanges in both the originating and destination corridors. The originating currency is exchanged into XRP which provides the [necessary liquidity to power the final payment](https://ripple.com/insights/liquidity-explained/), and then in seconds that XRP is exchanged into the destination currency in the second digital asset exchange. Once this transaction takes place, the funds are sent out on the local rails of the destination country for payout. The transaction is tracked end-to-end, and the result is a cross-border payment that is cheaper and faster than ever before.

2. The payment amount in XRP is settled over the XRP Ledger.

He said: ""Some may look back at Bitcoin and say that it is the Napster of digital assets.

“What I mean by that is that Napster was the first to digitise music and demonstrate that you can do a lot of cool things with that.

Maybe those mutual funds would be the ones to advertise cryptos so people invest in the fund and the fund manager gets fees. 

But otherwise, I think of it like foreign exchange. I don’t see many companies promoting the Aus dollar or the Japanese Yen. Companies just go about their business is Aus and Japan and then FX traders notice there is some fantastic product there that people have to pay for in AUD or Yen and so the FX trader decides to buy AUD because they reckon it will go up.

Obviously, the fourth quarter XRP Markets report will definitely provide more information about XRP supply and the ongoing sales; however, I don't expect much different from Ripple in that respect.  

Could some XRP whales be paring down even at these prices?  Anything is possible, but I highly doubt it.

I honestly don't get the tribalism. Cryptocurrency isn't a competition, there are uses far beyond payments; from medical to real estate and more. The irony is, the tribalism is actively playing a role in *suppressing* adoption. Ripples success means the success of Blockchain; and there's a lot of tokens that can solve issues Ripple isn't focused on. While theoretically with Coil & Codius it can solve more than just the transfer of value, Ripple is focused on that. 

Brad has mentioned, which I agree with, the biggest issue with most cryptocurrency is they don't have a clear focus or vision. Even ConsenSys describe themselves as:

>ConsenSys is solving real-world problems with Ethereum blockchain solutions for organizations of all sizes, from the local community to the global enterprise.

To me that's incredibly vague... 

And they are going through layoffs and ""restructuring;"" Joe Lubin admitted they scaled too fast without a clear focus. Instead of setting out to solve one problem, they set out to solve ""every"" problem. But when Blockchain is in such an infant state where it's struggling for legitimately providing use, the community is just fighting over which is better. You could tell in Brad's last AMA his prediction that institutional adoption didn't come in 2018; and you could tell a lot of his frustration was because of the immaturity of the community was actively a reason for causing it to be stifled.

Completely different sector but I remember when the Rift and Vive came out it was a ""which is better,"" now that it's becoming more poplar generally both communities get along. VRs relative success is because *both* companies, while in competition they realized they *had* to play nice. Cross platform is the largest reason for adoption imo; likely we wouldn't have PSVR without the Rift or Vive. Now the industry is more about the adoption of VR, not which hardware is better. There's PLENTY of room for multiple players.

I welcome and hope many other tokens survive, but I fully agree PoW is going to fail. It's had over a decade and has only proved slow, inefficient, expensive and damaging to the environment.

So I'll concede that some versions of POW are faster than others (BCH is faster and more scalable than Bitcoin, e.g.) but none can compare to consensus-based performance.  

Blocksize differences affect how different POWs can compete with each other, but has no bearing on making them competitive at a level with POS or consensus-based systems like XRP.

Take the US as example, sure we will regulate crypto but like all things in Congress the process is slow. In comes GPI as the interim solution for faster payments until...

Here's a snippit from a Bank of International Settlements document I found: 

""Digital central bank money is at the centre of the money flower. The taxonomy distinguishes between 
three forms of CBDCs (the dark grey shaded area). Two forms are token-based and the other is account-
based. The two token-based versions differ first and foremost by who has access, which, in turn, depends 
on the potential use of the CBDC. One is a widely available payment instrument that is primarily targeted 
at retail transactions but also available for much broader use.7
 The other is a restricted-access digital 
settlement token for wholesale payment and settlement transactions. Below they are referred to as (central 
bank) general purpose token and (central bank) wholesale token.""
https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf

Chris Larsen is very likely the one you heard about at the end of 2017.  He has agreed to donate a decent amount of his stack to charity.  I believe there's also something in there about selling and/or escrowing portions of it, but I don't remember the details.  The point of it all is to reduce his holdings so people don't freak out about him becoming the richest man in the world overnight.

David Schwartz elected a salary instead of a massive pile of XRP, so isn't really an issue in terms of having a huge stack.  I'm sure he's got a big pile of it somewhere, but not several billion like the other two.

Brad Garlinghouse was late to the party and while he does have a nice, big stack sitting around, he's in David's camp in terms of quantity.

Don't forget that several different companies are working on solutions for XRP, like Coil. Different use cases will bring more liquidity. How long do you think it would take for SWIFT to first develop their own coin, then market it to different exchanges to list it to build liquidity and then having tons of tests to make sure it's safe?

That is also the reason that a lot of the good ""Ripple"" news we are seeing doesn't have an impact on XRP's price...

The short answer (for most) is that the current price of XRP is inadequate to support a ""100% xRapid"" adoption scenario at the moment. Which is why a phased approach to adoption is both desired and beneficial to the XRP price. Slow and steady wins this race.

> is it a matter of more companies using it in order to see a price gain or is it the amount of money these companies transfer within a time


A bit of both. More companies need to be using it, which increases liquidity and reduces ""friction"" when transferring this value between the payment corridors

> how much would they need to transfer to affect the price?

Amounts in Tens-of-Thousands, then hundreds-of, then Millions. IMO we don't want to start with exorbitantly large transfers on XRP initially because I feel like the ""balloon"" would ultimately deflate. LARGE fluctuations in price cause concern between partners when it comes to value transfer.

The crypto market is unhealthy and subject to intensive manipulation. When your individual coin goes up or down when the rest don’t have movement thats when you pay attention. I’m not expecting to sell XRP until the very earliest EOY 2020. From 2019 i’m expecting to have clear verification that everyone who has been visiting this subreddit ended up making the right choice, because once XRapid starts kicking into gear and we see price increases from Xrapid adoption we’ll know it will eventually reach 100% of total amount of cross border payments. I am expecting from 2019 to see some XRapid price movements for probably less than 10% of the potential.

10756,"I expect a mass of upvotes and tips when this happens then. So many are caught in the fear and negative emotions still, but you need to remain calm, the same panic was evident back in 2015-16 etc when the market had ""crashed"" (again)  and then went on to set new ATH's (again).

Just search Google for news articles on the end of Bitcoin from 2014 onwards, there are masses of them.  And whether you agree or not, price action is fractal, it does repeat, you can see same patterns from daily view right down to minute view, same patterns all the time, and the overriding curve they sat in is the coppock curve.

XRP set it's bottom back in Aug/Sep and it hasn't touched it since (because that was the bottom of the curve). I gave you evidence of that in a link and also the trend strength for bears and bulls at each major move, these are generated from price history and you can either choose to believe them or not.

Many are still in despair despite fact XRP has held it's own for nearly 4-5 months now and set a new high for the last half of the year when it hit 0.80c outta nowhere, but you suddenly believe it's completely dead again for no reason. Amazing.

The crypto market is STILL very new and you are in this before it has really exploded, ignore the media and negative press, Ripple have spent the last few years getting into bed with banks and payment providers and it is going to revolutionise those industries - it has the biggest use case out of all cryptos and has been constantly growing vs $BTC directly this last year.

If you don't believe in the market, then cash out now as there's no point being here just to moan, do something about it, spend your life on something more useful and stop being a FOMO.

But those that believe in future technology, those that were ""online"" before the birth of the internet (BBS') or saw first hand the level of computer graphics go from a ZX80 to now in the space of 30-40yrs (I'm 43 btw) have a greater understanding and appreciation of technology and just how it's changing the world.

But back to oil. Now there are different oils actually, each has its own price-- Dubai, North Sea, Brent... every one differs in quality, distance to the markets, costs of shipping, etc. Despite XRP being one of the highest quality oils on the market, it's *still* oil. When there is a trade war somewhere the price of oil goes up and when there is a recession, oil prices go down. **All oil, not just one.** This is the same currently with cryptocurrencies-- it doesn't matter right now which one is 'best' as they are *all just cryptocurrencies* right now. There is a 'relative value' by default between any two products on the market, an exchange rate between all products if you will. For example *(totally random numbers)* 1 kg of gold = 1000kg of tomatoes = 140 chickens, etc.

They control ~60% of the asset in existence. Ownership is control - they get to decide what happens with it, subject to a democratic vote to remove their control, but that is in no-one's best interests at present, just like it's in no-one's best interest to replace the USD with some other currency, but it's still possible.

The only difference between an unmined coin and a mined one is that a mined one will eventually exist but doesn't yet and when it does we don't know who the owner will be. Miners could easily enter into futures contracts to supply a certain number of bitcoins at a future date, in much the same way as Ripple selling an escrow account to someone else - it's XRP gauranteed at a future date.

Exactly ownership is control, which is why what they hold is part of the CS. The US dollar isn't subject to decentralization, sure someone can replace the US dollar, but thats  not the same as the xrp ledger continuing without ripples holdings, as thats still xrp. Its not some new currency replacing the old one...

>No, if it doesn't circulate, it can't be part of the circulating supply. You keep ignoring the definition of 'circulating'.

I am not ignoring the definition. The problem is the term isn't used literally, if it was then majority of all assets are not circulating, as people hold them in their wallets. Hell Many bitcoin in circulation has NEVER even literally circulated from one wallet, so again the phrase make no sense and its not used literally.   If the phrase was used in terms that it circulated at some point in its existence, then this means there are 99.991B in circulation, since thats how many have actually circulated from one account to another on ledger.  This also falls in line with how the bitcoin blockchain considers an asset circulated once the coin-base transition is sent to the miner...

>The only difference between an un-mined coin and a mined one is that a mined one will eventually exist but doesn't yet and when it does we don't know who the owner will be. Miners could easily enter into futures contracts to supply a certain number of bitcoins at a future date, in much the same way as Ripple selling an escrow account to someone else - it's XRP gauranteed at a future date.

- This just supports my idea even further, that all assets are in circulation, even with bitcoin ( although I do feel its a little different, as the coin-base transaction on the blockchain sends the miner the bitcoin, this is why its considered circulating supply; It circulated to an active account once mined ( even though in a way that you would call ""Insignificant""), this is just like the xrp ripple holds that was sent to them by the genesis account.

Correct, Ripple didn't, but the related parties to Ripple did create it. Using a flimsy quirk of history to act like this is a strong argument is disingenuous.

> Exactly ownership is control, which is why what they hold is part of the CS. 

It's not circulating so it's not Circulating Supply.

> I am not ignoring the definition. The problem is the term isn't used literally, if it was then majority of all assets are not circulating, as people hold them in their wallets. 

It's whether the asset has ever been meaningfully transacted or not. The ~60B XRP owned by Ripple has not been. It's like if I create Frogglecoin and don't give them to anyone else, it's meaningless to say that Frogglecoin is circulating because there is no circulation in practice.

> Hell Many bitcoin in circulation has NEVER even literally circulated from one wallet, so again the phrase make no sense and its not used literally.

Yes, so the circulating supply of BTC is drastically overstated, whereas the commonly quoted circulating supply for XRP is correct.

> . If the phrase was used in terms that it circulated at some point in its existence, then this means there are 99.991B in circulation, since thats how many have actually circulated from one account to another on ledger.

No, because if I create frogglecoin, and give it to my mum, and she gives it back to me, it's still not meaningfully circulating. The XRP that Ripple holds has only been transacted between related parties. You're using a tiny quirk of history about who created what when and whether something was transacted or not, but ownership and control of the XRP in Ripple's cache of XRP has never meaningfully changed since it was first created, so it can't be said to be circulating in any useful sense of the word.

> This just supports my idea even further, that all assets are in circulation, even with bitcoin

I didn't have a clear exit strategy, or any strategy at all.

Of course in retrospect I wish i had taken out $10k or $20k and just left the rest to hopefully grow. It would have done a lot for me and my family. I eventually did take out just over double that initial investment and readjusted my portfolio (with a heavy lean toward XRP). I think I would take out a few grand if XRP ever gets back to its ATH, and then a bit more if it hits $5.

With all these FIs on ripple net using xrp, network effects on ripple net for xrp will start to spread. Other members can act as liquidity points in other banks payment paths. For example. Santander can initiate a payment from EUR to MXN. Instead of having a pile of MXN laying around, they can pay another ripple net member (like Cuallix) the EUR they hold. That member can then settle the payment in MXN using xrapid. Scenarios like this, xrp is used for the payment, and the iniating bank doesn't even know or care either way.

There is some question as to whether they're truly a bank or not, they appear to operate out of the West Indies but also have a London office.

Otherwise there are about a dozen companies using xRapid or in the process of putting it in production.

I think the GSG provides a measure of assurance that a single individual does not, so I'm confident that my micro-donations are going to the right place.  

The other thing to consider, is that with the XRP Tip Bot, only the owner of the Twitter account (if you're donating on Twitter) can access the XRP.  So that provides another layer of assurance if you need one.

11195,"there are several FIs using xrapid today, and around 20 who are confirmed to be implementing it. Its only live in two corridors. The price has gone up, a lot. Its up 9,000% in 22 months and 100% in the last 14 months( KIM bitcoin is negative in the last 14 months). Last time BTC,ETH,LTC was this price xrp was .17. XRP market dominance has increased dramatically. 

We dont see major movements because there is at times over 700m a day in volume for xrp, at most a few million is being used for remittance. Its going to take each institution to scale in the corridors they are using( business usually doubles once using ripple net due to the lowered cost), start using it in new corridors, and for utility volume to start putting pressure on the speculation volume.

Again they are SME's. I listed their revenue in my previous tweet, its not like these are startup. Xrapid is AIMED at SME's first( low hanging fruit approach). It will have effect on price, and that effect will continue to grow as they use it in more corridors and for more payments. ",19-01-09-07-29,8,3457,mikenard77,adykma

>Correct. I also know the definition of ""digital assets"". I also know that the XRP ledger can be used to create IOUs for any asset, including Bitcoin, and that these IOUs can be traded on Ripplenet, without the direct use or transaction of XRP.

Actually ripple refers to xrp as a digital asset, and bitcoin and others "" cryptocurrencies"". Of course the xrp ledger can be used to issue any asset, any non xrp asset is an IOU. These IOUs still use xrp, as the xrp ledger bridges all IOUs created and traded on ledger automatically with XRP, the trusdtline for these assets requires xrp, These transactions still destroy xrp, they still move IOUs on ledger, Thus they use xrp. 

Using bitcoin, or even USD on ripple net IS NOT an xrp ledger IOU. Its messaging On ILP with coordinated settlement of the real asset in an account.   So sure while SCB can be using bitcoin and BCH on ripple net, or only on their respective blockchains, there is no reason they wouldn't be using xrp as well or ONLY XRP. Its cheaper, and faster, and the payment network they use is built to work around it. 

As for IOUS on ripple net, everything on ripple net is an IOU. Ripple net is a messaging network with coordinated settlement. Its an IOU until it settles, just like your money in your bank account is an IOU until you withdraw.

EXIM has been implementing and testing xrapid already before this announcement. As brad said in the AMA ( the one where he says we have seen banks use xrapid in 2018 with examples like catalyst) they have to wait until the customers are ready. Exim didn't want to announce it until now clearly since they say they have been testing it.  They 100% tested it in 2018, and there's likely others to who used it in 2018 who didn't go public with that announcement yet. Just because the first bank went public, doesn't mean banks didn't use it in 2018.

This is always the case when using  both legs of xrapid. The bank never holds xrp. Over time banks will hold a pile of xrp, and just use the back leg of xrapid as its cheaper for several reasons( they can get a pile of xrp cheap by market making, and they only have to pay one exchange fee).  Even if the banks never hold xrp, the market maker is still holding more xrp for the increased demand. Someone is always holding all xrp in existence.

Xrapid is just a way to get FIs using xrapid. Once they do, its way cheaper to send xrp directly to each other. If they need to send to others who done accept it, they will use their pile of xrp with the back leg of xrapid( also cheaper than using both legs).

Also members can use xrp directly with other ripple net members as a means of exchange, instead of using xrapid (external exchange). For example Bank 1 can send xrp to bank 2, in exchange bank 2 can complete that payment in another currency.

another example is Bank 1 can send USD to Bank 2, and Bank 2 can use xrapid to finish a payment for them in another currency. ",19-01-09-07-45,5,3457,mikenard77,adyq8p

david Schwarz-   Imagine a system where XRP is the intermediary asset. You won't have to pay to build the pile, you'll get paid to build it. There are three possibilities:

1. You have the asset you need to deliver to the recipient. This is the cheapest in the actual payment part. But to make this work to every place you might need to pay, you need lots of piles of different assets. This is what companies do today, and it's expensive for them to always be ready to make whatever payments they might need to make.
2. You have some other fiat asset. This is where Ripple's solutions for FI-to-FI payments comes in. Using XRP as an intermediary asset and pools of liquidity, we want to make this kind of payment cheaper than the type above. Yes, the payment itself will probably cost more because you have to go into and out of XRP, but all you have to do is keep one pile of whatever your favorite asset to hold is.
3. You hold XRP. Here, the payment is cheapest because you only have to buy the asset you're delivering. But, as you point out, it only works if you get the XRP cheaply. So how do you do that? Well, everyone who wants to make a payment of type 2 using the asset you prefer to hold will need XRP to buy the asset they're delivering! So you make half the cost of their payment when you buy fiat from them. The point is, you can move your fiat into XRP at your leisure (assuming you can hedge the volatility) so you can be the maker, not the taker.

""Ripple, provider of leading enterprise blockchain solutions for payments, announced today that 13 new financial institutions have signed up for the company’s payment network, RippleNet. The companies include Euro Exim Bank﻿, SendFriend, JNFX, FTCS, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Transpaygo, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND and Rendimento. With these additions, there are now more than 200 customers signed up for RippleNet.

**JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank will leverage the digital asset XRP to source liquidity on-demand when sending payments on behalf of their customers. Using XRP for liquidity when sending a cross-border payment helps financial institutions avoid the hassle of pre-funding accounts in destination currencies. It allows them to make faster, lower cost payments than they can through the traditional correspondent banking System.""**

xCurrent is a solution designed to provide instant settlement and tracking of cross-border payments between RippleNet members. Unlike xRapid, the xCurrent solution is not based on the XRP Ledger and does not use the XRP cryptocurrency by default. The xCurrent is built around the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which was designed by Ripple as a protocol for connecting different ledgers or payment networks. (so while David's statement isn't *inaccurate,* xCurrent doesn't *have* to use blockchain-- but it could be considered a blockchain technology as it does interact with ILP. Think of xCurrent as just a *settlement* tool that *can* use blockchain-- but the reason it's still popular over traditional banking methods is that it offers instant settlement but still requires traditional Nostro/Vostro to fund. xCurrent was basically designed for fiat currencies; sort of 'training wheels' for banks to get their feet wet without completely committing, however as xRapid provides even more savings and completely instant and friction-less settlement, basically no customer on xCurrent has any reason *not* to use xRapid and will ultimately switch otherwise it's just ignoring even better savings. 

&#x200B;

It's already a far better solution to current technologies, and with xCurrent alone you see **much** quicker settlement, (minutes rather than days) depending on the local payment rails (unless it's ripple net that is the local rail then we are talking seconds. This is where the value of xRapid/XRP comes in-- you literally remove all volatility to the costs with it being so quick- enough that switching from xCurrent to xRapid is an **additional** 30% savings. (So roughly 40-60% total with xRapid versus 25-30% with only xCurrent)

Though i prob won't end up day trading it just cause its stressful and statistically you will lose. I'm not gonna put all that time into possibly  winning a couple hundred xrp by day trading, instead i'll prob buy in at like the current price and leave it alone until we see one of those huge surges we see every few months when it goes up by like 30-60% and then immediately sell having made a shit load of money and then i'll wait till it falls a significant amount before i buy back in (so far from what we've seen over the past year, every time it surges it ends up coming back down) so one day it's gonna surge but not come back down but your chances are good that it usually will. now going back to the original price i bought in, if it falls, i will just leave it alone and not give a shit, i won't play the bullshit day trading game of selling and hoping i can buy back in lower cause in the past, it usually screwed me over and gone back up right after i sold. so pretty much just endure it and wait till you can make a shit ton of money before you sell then just rinse and repeat. don't let ur emotions and greed take over thinking you can make a small bit of money by day trading and just be patient, there will be a surge at some point, and that's when you sell. also i don't have much experiences with taxes, but i would think it would be annoying to report all those trades on your taxes but just a few trades that made you a bunch of money would be pretty easy probably. If anyone has a good link to a site that goes over how to properly report capital gains, it would be awesome if you could share it. sucks  that we lose like 40% on profits from short terms trading and i don't even know if that includes state taxes. man if their was a person who ran for congress promising to reduce capital gains taxes, i'd prob vote for him so fast.",19-01-08-02-24,2,1,karna42,adio4f

12001,"Why does this matter?   Market cap means really nothing.  BTCs supply has many coins that are lost but it’s really uncertain whether they will be recovered or maybe the owners just haven’t done anything with them yet.   Ripple’s xrp is in Escrow and released periodically and is certain.   These xrp don’t affect the price since they aren’t affecting supply and demand.   Ideally circulating supply for btc would only count non lost mined coins and xrp’s CS would be all xrp not in escrow by Ripple.   They are two different types of cryptos.  Mined and pre-mined.  With BTC, immediately when mined they have the ability to sell.   A pre-mined coin can sell one of its pre-mined coins and market cap would be greatly over valued based off one sale.  There is no way to evenly evaluate a market cap for cryptos at this time.   Thus, it’s on the users to understand how many coins there are, where they’re being held, the probability they will be used, and when they be used.

Market cap is a useless measure to try estimate a limit on the price of a deflationary decentralized asset, because its value isn’t tied to a a companies earnings statement like stocks. Its supply and demand of multidimensional utility. Market cap is still a very relevant and useful measure, as long as you understand what it is and why its used in specific markets.

Xrp has many lost assets as well. Every transaction destroys xrp. It HAS NOTHING to do with escrow CMC excluded all the xrp ripples owned before it was ever put in escrow last year. They still exclude the 8b ripple never puts in escrow from the CS. 

Xrp is not premined. Mining does not even exist in the protocol. All xrp are coded into the protocol just like BTC. Mining doesn’t create new assets, btc are a reward to incentivize mining. Escrow is simply a smart contract. It’s the users choice, just like I can put xrp in escrow right now and it won’t be removed( regardless we already established it has nothing to do with escrow).

I have no problem excluding xrp ripple owns, xrp in smart contracts, or both. In that case it has to be fair and all btc that’s never moved from a genesis account, held by a developer, or in a smart contract should also be removed from circulation.

Just like selling xrp, selling bitcoin does the same for market cap. It’s all about the density of the order books/ supply vS demand. That’s how market cap works, it’s simply price times assets, it doesn’t take that amount invested to make that market cap. 

Circulation was simply a term to describe assets that were now found on the ledger because they were rewarded from mining. They were in circulation before because no one held them. All xrp were created with the protocol, they exists on ledger. They have all moved from the original genesis account.

This is completely untrue. All assets in crypto are known unless its an inflationary protocol. It doesn't matter what their status is, You can argue the same for the stock market as all assets that exists are known( regardless if they are locked up in a selling stipulation or not). Market cap in stocks is all outstanding shares. Same goes for liquidity, you don't think the stock market is manipulated? You think the market cap in stocks represent the actual value that can be pulled out of it?

This is not the case at all, as there are many other metrics that could be used to make this list from volume to transactions, and the same argument holds true for all of them. Market cap is a measure to compare cryptos NOW, not someday, its not a way to try and predict their possible growth as its market cap is not tied to any specific metrics. Its simply supply and demand. 

Market cap works the same with stocks, just like apple stock market cap is 703B, it does not mean 703 billion can be pulled from apple stock.  Again, all the xrp ripple holds is in circulation and always was. Escrow didn't start till 12 months ago, a smart contract doesn't take an asset out of circulation. Notice how nothing changed with price? It wasn't some dramatic event, as its already all figured in as its common knowledge.  CMC always excluded it before escrow, thus it came down to ripple owning it. Regardless if its considered circulating on one scale, and not on another, its factored into the price either way because those assets exist.

Even when using xrp between exchanges there is still ledger movement as the xrp goes from one exchange wallet to the next. The only time an exchange does internal account movements without effecting ledger movements is when one is using the exchange for internal trading. Even using the XRP Ledger for decentralized exchange wont really change much, as even 500 million more in on ledger trade volume (or even just payment volume) would only mean 5,000 more xrp destroyed a day, 2 million more a year. This is something that doesn’t bother ripple either, as they have shifted from the gateway to the exchange model. I’m not including wallet reserves and trust line object reserves (so keep that in mind).

In fact it may help using exchanges overall, because it’s the cheapest when a xrapid user holds a pile of xrp large enough (at minimum) to make their largest possible payment. This wouldn’t be the case using the XRP Ledger for trade volume between assets since it bridges order books and is basically free. If the xrpL was the means of trade there wouldn’t be much xrp needed to be held directly (just enough to cover fees of the trade .00001xrp per trade) as the user would hold the IOU of their choice. The external exchange approach may actually drive price more than on ledger trading since there’s more benefits to holding a large pile of xrp when using exchanges for xrapid users....

The order book on an exchange or on the XRP Ledger are still going to move price either way(hodor states this as well “that it shouldn’t matter”). It does get to the point where many owning the asset won’t move it off an exchange, and this may never reflect in the market as they may never withdraw, so the exchange may never actually buy xrp to hold for them. This may be the case for some exchanges, but the big ones all have transparency or even legal obligations and we know they hold 100% of the assets their users think they hold, or at least are legally obligated to. As regulation continues, exchanges will have to play by the rules more and more(especially since any exchange that has withdrawals will have a public key corresponding to those withdrawals thus the users can see how much xrp or other assets they hold). 

Personally I feel Hodors article was more about the proof of keys movement, since that’s the only time one really holds the keys to their crypto, and less about doing it to move price....

Solid article top to bottom. I do think regulation is needed for exchanges to operate under a set of transparent rules as the conflict of interest has risen to unhealthy levels. As you may know, the Token Taxonomy Act has proposed new rules on Tokens and ICO's, but I think it is important not to stop there.

I think the following is needed: exchange reserve transparency, anti-insider trading, and anti-collusion are three critical points that need to be addressed, as it is (in my opinion) already out of hand. I do hope to see regulation on these items, and I have reached out to Congressman Warren Davidson on addressing these items in the future. Appreciate the detailed write-up as always.

But the danger in indefinitely leaving your crypto there is that:

1) Typical exchanges don't share the secret keys with you (even to your own crypto).  
2) Since they have the secret keys and ownership of the crypto until you decide to withdraw, there's no guarantee that trading on an exchange results directly in crypto purchases unless we all withdraw the crypto at some point.

12360,"It does depend on the scenario. I have been in two of them.

a few months ago i had 400 withdrawn from my account. They only way I got it back, was finding the company who did it and reporting fraud to them. They had to refund me, bank couldn't do anything without police reports and paper work. Ended up being an account number punched in wrong on the companies end( at least thats what they said).... Sure a bank could get it back for you in the end after weeks and paperwork, but the point is with crypto is it doesn't happen at all since its not a push/pull system( crypto is only push)

In the case of user error( what we see with crypto), its also a little different for banks.  I once paid off a progressive account in the full amount, after paying 3 months of payments( paid the amount I would have without paying the 3 months). The bank could net get it back for me. Progressive had to do it. I even did a fraud report as I didn't owe progressive the much money. Eventually progressive refunded me, but they were trying to make me use the funds for my upcoming renewal. 

My point is with crypto it can be avoided fully, especially utilizing whitelists, qr codes, contacts, etc ( depending on the service). Many exchanges do offer insurance on part of their mistakes( they cant be liable for peoples mistakes) especially when on exchanges like binance there is a contact list the user can choose from when withdrawing to the whitelist accounts.....

They are not, however, advertising a HARDWARE WALLET (the thing that allows signing transactions without having the key on the computer). They are advertising a COLD STORAGE solution for storing ARBITRARY TEXT in a more secure way on what is essentially a USB KEY.

Let's say you have an account that uses multi-sig authentication with a threshold weight of 1. You have two keys that can operate the account in this situation. Now, let's say you store one of those keys on this COLD STORAGE product and then put that item in a safe deposit box in a bank or some other secure location. You will never ever use that key, unless you somehow lose the other ""hot"" key you had access to.

In this situation, it doesn't matter that you then have to expose your private key, because you should be changing it anyway. You lost access to your other key, so you would use the key stored away in cold storage to either move your funds to a new private key, or to generate a new private key to authenticate with your account (in some versions of blockchain, such as Steem, this is necessary)

Again, you are speaking as someone that is referring to a HARDWARE WALLET and uses it solely with crypto that has ONE key. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Steem and EOS to name just a couple, allow you to designate multiple keys to an account, therefore enabling you to have a true backup key that you NEVER use. PROPER COLD STORAGE would be more than fine for such a key as you would not be using it in daily activities to sign transactions.

You seem to know a little bit about blockchain security, but not enough to realize the claims you are bringing up, while valid about HARDWARE WALLETS, do not really apply to an ARBITRARY COLD STORAGE solution.

To further make my point: Ledger Nano S \*\*DOES NOT\*\* support every single cryptocurrency. It can neither properly store an arbitrary key, nor can it sign for cryptos that haven't specifically created a supporting Ledger application.

The application store such as Google Play and the Apple App Store are highly ineffective at preventing trojan loaders on a device. If an application downloads a payload AFTER it is installed on your device, it is often able to skirt by the app store security policies and checks.

Encryption is AES-256-CBC with slow hashed encryption password. This way you do not have to do your encryption manually, every time. Not everybody can setup proper encryption.

If you chose to have a [key card](https://nfcwalletcard.com/additional-security-with-the-key-card) added to your encryption setup, the app can be used to generate a very strong encryption password to fill the key card. This way the encryption passwords you use to encrypt the data (your PK, or seed for example) will be much more complex than entering a usual password.

With the key card you can use [security levels](https://nfcwalletcard.com/security-levels) available in [our application](https://nfcwalletcard.com/application).

We will publish detailed specifications soon, good to know you are interested!

Our application is designed to be as secure as possible, you can add additional restrictions with your OS. The application is separated from the internet and access only the most essential resources as described in our strict application policy.

I understand your concern about man-in-the-middle attacks, but how could we obtain your data, when the app has no access to the internet at all?",19-01-04-15-00,2,224,nfcwalletcard,ace7j1
12473,"You try to make the point that for average users the smartphone is the best option then you go off on a tangent about installing a custom ROM, using wiping tools, or various other non average user tasks.

You are giving a very false sense of security by acting like Android (which is a VERY blanket term for a base operating system that is not standardized) is secure. Google android is different from HTC android is different from another android. All of them have their own upstream for code changes and security updates and NONE of them work together.

Often times when a firmware update or OS update is released in Android source, it takes multiple months or years to get pushed out from the OEM. Iphone is actually far more secure than android, ON AVERAGE, because of the standardized practices for pushing hardware and software updates.

Still, your company is selling a device that is not an android, why are you sitting around trying to argue that android phones are super secure? Shouldn't your marketing be saying storing keys or anything else on your cell phone or computer is a bad idea, therefore people should buy your product for enhanced security?

Why would I ever purchase your key card if a cheap android device with an unlocked bootloader and NFC is just as safe and secure?

I feel like you are kind of countering what your company marketing plan seems to be.

With xCurrent you have instant settlement with lower cost than SWIFT but you still have to hold nostro/vostro accounts. With xRapid they made it so it could easily work together with xCurrent. When the xCurrent network is large enough there is a strong incentive for the few banks and FIs that are willing to be innovative and provide customers with a better experience to start usin xRapid.

I'm obsessed. I can't stop looking at the price charts on Binance. I've always got a computer or my phone nearby with the XRP/USDT pairing up. Even at work, since I'm the boss I can do what I want pretty much. I'm also the shit at work so it's easy to go on autopilot and watch my phone or my other computer when I'm working and still get everything done. I don't sleep much anymore either as my already moderate to heavy insomnia has been pushed into overdrive. Watching the 1m charts generally so that I can watch it happen in real time because I know it's coming tomorrow. I've been like this since the september run. I'm not bullshitting, I'm watching charts 14 hours or more a day and I don't work in finance. It had to stop, and here's how I did it.

&#x200B;

Look into rebalancing if you don't know what it is and you're willing to risk a small portion of your XRP. I use Shrimpy on Binance due to the high volume and variety of coins coupled with reduced fees - and the rebalancing service is free - but there are other options. Binance now has price alerts on the app.

&#x200B;

Set up rebalancing so that you're holding coins that you know are safe. For me it's exclusively XRP, however for this strategy to work you need more than 1 coin so I went with HOT and NPXS since they've bottomed out and can't go much lower, and if they're worth the same in 6 months that's fine because they have enough volatility at the current price point that the bot can work with it and build XRP.

&#x200B;

Set buy and sell price alerts on XRP/USDT so that if it hits your targets you'll be notified and can act accordingly. If it drops into the $.20's I can buy more if I choose to, and if it gets to my sell target I can sell a bit if I choose to. Either way I don't have to watch it, my bot and binance are doing it for me and they'll let me know when it's time to do something.

&#x200B;

Obviously I still monitor it loosely because you don't just cold turkey something like this when money is on the line, but I've reduced it to checking the 30m charts a few times a day, and I don't watch them unless I'm considering making a move of some kind. It's quite refreshing! Now I need to find a way to get the fomo to stop convincing me to buy more. It's just so cheap...",19-01-03-15-06,-14,197,21020humbleworkhorse,ac1qou

Removing crypto from the exchanges will likely drive the price up a little since purchasable supply is reduced and ideally demand will stay the same, but it could also drop the price in the short term as some exchanges are shown to be “over sold” and illiquid (really screwing some people on their platforms), thus reducing the trust, and price, of the crypto ecosystem. In the long run though it should increase the price since right now a lot of “fake” crypto **may** exist diluting the market, but after the clean up the there should be very little fake crypto.  Overall I would expect the price to stay the same with a potential exponential dip based on the number of exchanges that choke, but in the long term an overall rise in price.

1. It increases the value of the XRP that Ripple holds and thus the value of the company.
2. It lets the company materialize more value for its stockholders by selling XRP.
3. It  reduces the risk of a loss by people holding XRP, thus increasing their  willingness to hold it. Even if there is the occasional drop, the long  term upward trend would win out.
4. Those  who had to hold XRP for business purposes but couldn't tolerate risk  could just offload both the upside and the downside to a third party at  zero cost. So long as the upside is clearly greater than the downside,  this would be possible.
5. The  price of XRP, for better or for worse, is often interpreted as a  success metric for Ripple. So an increasing price of XRP would create  the perception that Ripple is succeeding. This could help drive  adoption.

Because you can't easily know if a rally is  a sustained increase in demand or a pump and dump.

If you're saying that's actively happening now, then I'd have to disagree.

If you're saying that's possible in the future, then yes, of course.

Literally a higher price for any resource (which includes XRP in this example) encourages more supply of that resources to be available on the market. For things like gold, silver and oil, the higher prices prompt companies to look for more reserves to sell the product into the market, and because the price is higher they can justify more costly investments to mine the resource, and then the higher profits cover the increased costs.

In the case of XRP, there is a fixed and very gradually decreasing supply, so higher prices would encourage people who aren't making good use of their XRP to sell - Ripple themselves will obviously cash in when the price reaches certain levels, and the average bag-holder will start to sell their XRP too. They're just sitting with it in a wallet waiting for the price to appreciate, whereas someone else wants to buy XRP so they can use it and are willing to pay a particular (high) price to do so, and so the bag-holder sells their XRP and the buyer gets to buy it and use it.

So of course in such a market, if someone has deep enough pockets they can start to buy and hoard XRP, only to sell it again once it meets a price they're happy with.

I wish it was that simple. 

The problem isn't that its in escrow. They consider 8B ripple holds out of escrow as uncirculated too. CMC always excluded ripples xrp even before it was ever placed in escrow(december 2017). Escrow is simply a smart contract. Many people on the xrp ledger use escrow besides ripple, many people use smart contracts for bitcoin or etc, why are those still part of their CS? A smart contract/escrow should always be counted as circulated since its the choice of the person, not a protocol rule. 

All 100b xrp existed in an account at genesis, they have since all been moved from that account, you cant do that with an asset thats never been awarded for mining yet( mining doesn't create the asset, thats hard coded into the protocol).

I wouldn't be opposed to excluding the xrp in escrow, if they did the same for BTC/ETC in smart contracts, and added the to the CS the 8b they dont have in escrow.

-The purpose of mining is to solve the double spend problem, the only reason BTC is a reward for mining, is incentive miners for a period long enough for the network to grow. Soon there will be no new bitcoin from mining.While the purpose of mining isn't supply predictability( it indirectly achieves that), majority of ripples holdings in escrow does do that +.07 u/xrptipbot

-Escrow the feature was created as way to have smart contracts on ledger. Ripple put majority of their share in escrow for supply predictability. https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/

-Escrow is just a smart contract, it does not mean the market is flooded with those assets if they aren't in escrow, ripple would still hold them and only use them as needed( just like the 8b not in escrow). It would have 0 direct effect on the price if they were in escrow or out of escrow. As I stated earlier, escrow just started being used one year ago. 

I do see why some could have more confidence that the majority supply in escrow ""feels safer"", so it indirectly could effect the market, although it shouldn't. There isn't enough liquidity in the market to dump even the 8b ripple has on hand, so either way with out without escrow we would get the same effect( the network would pass an amendment after the initial dump, so they cant do it long term with their majority share) ",19-01-02-15-06,1,3458,mikenard77,abpoam

Despite the overall sentiment in the cryptoverse my faith in XRP has never been higher. In fact I just loaded up my bags further. 

I believe we're finally seeing a market that isn't just driven by speculation and emotion. It's completely unhealthy for these ludicrous gains based on nothing but emotion and speculation, I feel the community is shaking off the investors trying to make a quick dollar; and we're seeing that with XRP volume growing and keeping stable. While the price of XRP may not be what we expected, I've never been more assured that Ripple, Coil, R3 and Codius will just continue to increase XRP volume organically. 

Thanks for being a voice and bastion for the community and I do believe 2019 will just see further growth, likely beyond what anyone can imagine. Reading all your posts paints a picture that these developments aren't false promises, where we'll be in a year, three years, five years? It's anyone's guess; but I have little doubt Ripple won't go down without a fight.

I was just wondering if anyone has ever come close to just taking the loss, selling up and getting out of crypto? I ask this because I can honestly say since I bought my first XRP in November 2017 the thought hasn't at any point entered my mind. Maybe because I definitely haven't got as much as most on here but for someone my age in my job sector, it is a good amount, maybe it's because I have been cost averaging all year, or maybe it's just because I have full confidence in Ripple and in the XRP project.

People can’t just rush to judgement in this space before it matures - No one knows, it’s too new.  Or think that the world changes overnight - newsflash - it wont.  This is big.  It just is.  From all angles.  From the government and regulation, to the sheer amount of money, to entire countries potentially overhauling their entire banking systems - that have been in place for decades, etc.  This process will just take time.  It’s impossible for me to see it any other way - just too big from too many angles.  

But biggest angle of them all?  The overwhelming potential.  It’s there, it’s real, and it’s legit.  Is there risk?  Sure.  Is there risk in the stock market right now too?  Yes.  

Just ask yourself, honestly, knowing what you know now, and based on the news from 2018 and early signs of growth/adoption, use cases, etc, does the future look bright to you for XRP and Ripple?  For me - Bright, TOO bright, BRIGHT AF.  IMHO We should all keep that in mind as we start fresh w 2019.

XRP is a different animal. For one, it is not preying upon retail investors even though some may like to portray it that way. Like a casino no one forced you to buy in, but that's not their game anyway. They have much loftier goals. Still a gamble, but if we can't bet on a powerhouse of visionaries behind innovative technology then we shouldn't be betting at all. Of course it's all early speculation right now, but no guts, no glory. 

I will often say to players if we knew what was going to happen this place wouldn't exist. Ripple's method is sound and their vision is laser-focused.

",18-12-30-13-34,12,75,OldSpice45,aarul2
13400,"It's an interesting notion.

And certainly the US government and others are aware and have been for some time - since the dawn - of cryptocurrency.

Since BTC and the white paper you better believe that the brightest minds in mathematics, technology and networks have been tasked by modern governments to find ways and means to stay up-to-date and if possible out front on the entire cryptocurrency phenomenon.

At outset of crypto governments such as the US or China or wherever would have had no concrete idea if this new technology could kick of a revolution that might grow faster than they could think. i.e. they'd have had no real way to predict that within a year of Bitcoin becoming popular it may have mushroomed and essentially began competing seriously with banking and finance infrastructure (which one or other crypto's will inevitably do). They'd have had no real way to predict whether a  black swan event or sudden financial crash might have sent entire populations towards buying Bitcoin, again this could happen hypothetically.

So, absolutely since the beginning governments have been trying to keep up with and strategically counter cryptocurrency. Thus as the OP points out, they may well throw their weight behind XRP / Ripple or other various tokens and technologies.

If true one company already controls 65% of the BTC network. You only need 51% to decide what changes get adopted and also to do more nefarious things like double spend, reverse transactions, or freeze the network.

Bitcoin is simply not winning that battle right now, facial recognition payments is clearly the front runner and China is pissed about this. They want to control their people, that’s all it’s about and releasing a payment system centered around their own government coin looks incredibly enticing.

13513,"Xcurrent is a messaging system for any asset( built on ILP). Why would you come to the conclusion that xrp is not needed? Its meant for any asset. An FI wouldn't use xrapid when someone accepts xrp directly. They wouldnt pay exchange fees, withdrawal fees, transaction fees, spread fees, etc for no reason.  xrapid is simply a way to use xrp, without holding it. Its a way to get FIs using xrp easily, instead of having to maintain several nostro/vostro relationships. 

The cheapest and most efficient way to use xrp, is directly. Its also cheaper to hold a pile of xrp( hedge as they already do with other currencies for volatility), and use the back leg of xrapid to send fiat to a ripple net member who does not accept xrp.For ripple net members that do accept xrp they can send it to them directly( as thats the cheapest and fastest way without bilateral fiat relationships; this would be xcurrent as there is no xrapid process used here ). 

An FI can also send xrp directly to other ripple net members who accepts it as a currency, but this time as a point in a payment path. This member can then keep the xrp, and finish the payment in the needed currency to the receiver. This would be xcurrent; there is no external exchange needed. 
(keep in mind this is basically what xRapid does without exchanges as the LP, instead its other Ripple net members)

An Xrapid user can even provide another bank with a currency they need( or make the payment for them in that currency) that they source from xrapid. The originating bank sends them fiat directly, and the transaction is complete.

Xrapid always uses xrp, xrp can also be used without xrapid( look at flash fx). Xcurrent most certainly can use xrp as it uses any currency, it even has direct xrapid integration so any xcurrent or via user can initiate an xrapid transaction. Not to mention multihop( any FIs payment flow can touch xrp without them even knowing)

The reason you're not seeing the needle budge at all with every positive announcement is that we're still in extremely early. Your huge bag holders are invested in basically keeping cryptocurrency a commodity rather than a useful technology; think of the .com. Huge amount of start ups that failed to deliver anything but false promises. Eventually it will come crashing and your Amazon, Google, eBay etc will rise from the ashes. Ripple continues to grow and expand; that's what should be paid attention to.

13625,"It’s because XRP currently isn’t very efficient for large institutional use.

It will be, eventually, but for right now the low price and lack of liquidity  mean that it isn’t (yet) a practical solution for the kind of large scale transfers of value that FIs would need it to provide for real adoption and regular use.

At the moment, if you wanted to transfer US$1 million using XRP as the bridge, you would need to source around 2.5 million XRP at your end (I haven’t checked the exact price ATM so that’s a rough guesstimate) AND feel confident that you’d be able to quickly sell that 2.5 million XRP at the other end of the transfer with it still being able to deliver the equivalent value in your target currency.

With liquidity being what it is right now, that amount of XRP would likely spike the price way up on your starting exchange as it sucks up all the available Sell orders to gain that amount of XRP, and then crash the price on the destination exchange as it desperately tries to convert XRP back to local fiat from their buy orders.

And that’s just to transfer $1 million. Banks and large FX transfer institutions deal with daily amounts that are orders of magnitude larger than that.

Consider instead if XRP was trading at $1,000.

Then you’d only need to source (and subsequently sell) 1,000 XRP to facilitate your transfer. At that point it becomes much more practical for large institutions to use XRP as the transfer medium for their money movements.

TL:DR

Brad “flipping the switch” isn’t what will drive the price up. Ripple have laid the train tracks,  but until the price of XRP reaches a critical mass it won’t be practical for large scale use the way it’s intended. Thinking that “utility” will be the next big driver of price increases is putting the cart before the horse.

That being said, I’m confident that if/when the price hits a suitable tipping point (no idea what that point might be, maybe $100, maybe $200, maybe $589) FIs will feel more confident about utilizing XRP on a regular basis and that will be the second stage rocket booster that takes us to the moon.",18-12-30-15-06,2,44,VadersHelmetPolish,aasjn6

Crypto in general, but especially Ripples products, lowers the entry barrier to global remittances dramatically. With the success of xRapid, the advantages WU has will slowly start to disappear.

WU definitely knows this. So it puts them in a weird situation where they should probably use xRapid for its advantages (and to have a jump start on being able to use it/ stay ahead of competition). But they shouldn't necessarily want to endorse how great it is, because they want to keep there current advantages as long as they can.

To me this was a huge positive sign, it shows this product ripple made in the last year is on par with the system it took WU 100 years to perfect.

Also WU isn’t going to come out and give any props to xrapid until they are using it for two reasons. If they show attention they will lose first Mover advantage, and they will also acknowledge that their competitors(who can now offer cheaper transactions) are using a better solution.

13802,"Yes, a large part will be sunk costs, but there will also be a level of ongoing costs attached to that infrastructure, which may not be entirely obvious initially. Like they were never in a position to switch to some other system before, so taking the time to work out what their ongoing running costs truly are may not have been an exercise that they'd ever carried out before. Also with these sorts of systems, unless you move 100% over to a new system, you often can't decommission most of the old system until its no longer being used at all. It's also quite possible that the effort and cost involved in moving from the old system towards the new system could consume 4-5 years of the cost savings of using the new system, putting this into the medium-long term investment-for-payback situation, which makes it a harder proposition to adopt.

EDIT: DIDN'T EVEN SEE THAT YOUR EXAMPLE WAS USD TO USD. In that case there is no need for the exchange at all and its a waste of counter party risk, fees, etc. most local rails will be instant, and many already are near instant( SEPA,SEPI,xcurrent(ripple net)). 

Many banks will hold pools of xrp, and just using the back leg of xrapid when sending to others who don't accept xrp directly. They will hedge like they currently do with other currencies for volatility. 

Others who dont want to hold xrp directly will use both legs of xrapid.   

With Ripple net or other fast rails like SEPA, the payment initiator can send any fiat to an exchange instantly or as fast as minutes( this is why xcurrent is so important, the more exchanges on ripple net, the more FIs can send exchanges instant fiat payments)

 The recipient can not use a separate exchange. When using xrapid ONE FI connects to both exchanges, does the whole transfer, then the amount is sent out on the local rails to the receivers bank account.

ONDON (Alliance News) - Visa Inc and Earthport PLC reached an agreement for the US credit card giant to buy the London-listed cross-border payment provider in a deal that values Earthport at GBP198 million.

Visa International Service Association, a unit of Visa Inc, will acquire Earthport for 30p per share, a 50% premium to the 20p per share price at which Earthport was valued back on October 4, 2017.

At that time, Earthport raised GBP25.0 million in a placing of 125.0 million shares at 20p apiece.

Earthport shares jumped on Thursday at the London market open, trading at 28.20p each. On Monday Earthport stock closed at 7.45p.

Earthport's board unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the deal, which they deem ""fair and reasonable"".

Earthport's Chairman Sunil Sabharwal said: ""The Earthport board believes the offer represents an opportunity for shareholders to realise an immediate and attractive cash value in Earthport today. Visa shares our vision of growth and expansion for Earthport and, as such, we believe it is a suitable and appropriate partner for our employees, partners, customers and other stakeholders.""

Over 17% of Earthport investors – including Oppenheimer and OFI Global Institutional – have already committed to accepting the takeover.

14257,[deleted],18-12-27-00-11,-15,0,[deleted],a9oggv
14258,"XRP is a terrible crypto currency, that's why.

1. It is centralized.  Ripple must verify nodes before adding them to UNL, this is a form of control from the company.  They also set the default UNL, this is another form of control, whoever they choose as default UNL will have a lot more control over validating the network, who picks who is in the UNL?  Having a set number of validator nodes is also not trustless or censorship resistant.

2. It has one of the worst possible distribution methods.  The company gifted itself the entire supply and is selling it for profit.  Why would anyone adopt a crypto currency like this?  Crypto currency is supposed to be a new global money revolution, to gain adoption it has to be as fair as possible.  Most people in crypto will never adopt XRP as their currency of choice because of this.

3. There is no profit model from holding the coin.  If Banks and FIs are only using XRP for immediate transfers (and not holding XRP tokens) then they will not cause the price to go up, because there is equal demand and supply.

4. Other crypto currencies that can scale will gain higher levels of adoption and replace the services XRP provides.  Why? Because they will have far more liquidity than XRP when the market cap for that #1 crypto becomes in the trillions, which means it will be much easier for banks to use the service.

XRP is not Ripple. That is a fact. XRP is a decentralised digital asset created by people. Ripple is a centralised company that offers Fin Tech solutions to Banks & Financial Institutions. This is to to aid with Faster Payment and Settlement of transactions. Some of Ripples solutions utilise XRP to achieve their function. Ripple's founders were gifted a significant amount of XRP by  the architects of XRP. Some of those who work at Ripple may also ahve been architects of XRP.  

Ripple offer  solutions including xCurrent and xRapid. xCurrent is in effect a messaging system like SWIFT. It allows effectively instant payment my sending messages faster. It allows instant payment. xRapid allows for instant Settlement by utilising XRP. This facilitates the removal of costly Nostro Vostro accounts, allows for 4s transfer of money across international borders: Makes payments as fast and cheap as email. Every bank and FI dreams of such a product. They will 100% use it if they are able to. it saves them a significant amount of both time and money.

When xCurrent is used, since it does not tap into XRP to move that much money, the effect of price is none existent. Once xRapid is used the volume of XRP transactions will go up. As the amount of money banks and FIs will move is significantly high the cost of XRP will need to be much higher in order for it to still be effective as a medium. It will *need* to go up and stay up in order for banks/FIs to use this tech to it's full potential. How it goes up is the question mark. 

Only Ripple and partners truly now how they will achieve this. But one thing is for sure. Many exchanges, Banks and FIs are partnering with Ripple. XRP is being loaded up by exchanges to ensure liquidity. Banks cannot act as custodies of XRP yet due to regulation. Brad Garlinghouse has publicly stated this will change in 2019. Why would banks need to hold it? Because they will use it. They can only truly use it if the price goes higher. How high?

14332,"They basically think Bitcoin will not only replace ALL money In the world but also take all the power away from governments and banks globally, so show making the people have all the power again. A few problems with this.

1) Bitcoin mining is ludicrously expensive and damaging to the environment. At the time of writing, the total electricity use of bitcoin mining equalled that of mid-sized economies such as Switzerland.
2) Three huge farms in China control the majority of mining and therefore nodes; basically centralising it giving them voting power.
3) There are 21 million BTC when all the mining is completed. If the whole global economy and financial wealth did become used by Bitcoin, it's value would be around $3,800,000, which leads to buying a coffee costing 0.0000000058385 BTC which just rolls off the tongue. Yes, you can use Satoshis, which is Bitcoins smaller denomination, but it's still a total mess.
4) Your $5 coffee has a transaction fee, ranging from $0.83-$30 depending who you ask. (NB this was $57 when at BTCs all time high)
5) This commission is only a small part of the discomfort that cryptocurrencies can introduce into daily life. Now one transaction can take from 10 to 60 minutes. The overloaded netwok can increase this time to up to 33 hours! You're going to have to stand there and let your coffee get cold until the transaction is complete.
6) Banks have been around for thousands of years and whilst capitalism and IOUs are despised by many, we have yet to come up with a better system. If BTC did replaced everything, does it even solve the problem? Who's going to lend you 0.35 BTC for your mortgage? Or a loan for that car? How do you get a line of BTC credit, a ""credit card?"" Probably some rich financial institution can lend you that money, plus interest.

1. There's no guarantee any of those projects or companies will be funded by xpring or amount to anything.
2. Companies often post positive spin or statements that are just pure marketing with little to no real backing behind them - look no farther than the hundreds of ICOs in the cryptospace.

I'm not here to start arguments, I'm here to add a dose of reality and pessimism into the conversations on this sub, because a lot of people are unduly optimistic about XRP and Ripple or just straight out posting speculation as fact.

Thats not what we are discussing though, we are discussing amendments; like a hard fork( but in the amendment instance its always 80% or more nodes), if you don't understand how that possible, then I suggest you look into POW and POC(RCA) protocols a little more.....If the majority of the users on the protocol want to change the supply to 50b or 200b, it's completely possible.",18-12-25-15-06,3,3458,mikenard77,a9btog

14807,"**Currency pair**

A currency pair is the quotation of the relative value of a currency unit against the unit of another currency in the foreign exchange market. The currency that is used as the reference is called the counter currency, quote currency or currency and the currency that is quoted in relation is called the base currency or transaction currency.

Currency pairs are generally written by concatenating the ISO currency codes (ISO 4217) of the base currency and the counter currency, and then separating the two codes with a slash. Alternatively the slash may be omitted, or replaced by either a dot or a dash.

Let’s say that you firmly believe that XRP will rise at a faster rate than BTC or ETH (currently the two main trading pairs, really the only trading pairs). That means that if you hold XRP and want to trade into another coin temporarily (let’s say TRX) then trade back to XRP, you need to trade XRP to BTC or ETH, then trade BTC/ETH for TRX, then when you want to exit the trade and get back into XRP, you need to trade TRX back to BTC/ETH, then BTC/ETH back to XRP. That’s 4 trades just to move your money to two destinations. thats 4 trade fees. 

It looks like:
(If You are holding XRP)
- XRP -> BTC
- BTC -> TRX (you are now in the trade)
- TRX -> BTC 
- BTC -> XRP (you are now back in XRP)

If XRP is a base pair, then the trade is simply XRP to TRX, then TRX back to XRP. In and out, and you are back to holding your XRP until you are ready to make another trade.

It looks like:
(If you are holding XRP)
- XRP -> TRX (you are now in the trade)
- TRX -> XRP (you are now back in XRP)

This doesn’t really affect you if 1) you only hold and don’t trade, or 2) you plan to hold BTC/ETH instead of XRP anyways. If either of those two situations are you, this news won’t help you except for the fact that it’s pumping XRPs price. 

It DOES help you if you prefer XRP over BTC/ETH and you still want to trade, which IMO is a lot of people",18-12-24-18-27,19,1876,unfurL,a92xsf
14847,"To trade xrp for Trx(just an example), there needs to be a pair. Usually only bitcoin and eth are used as base pairs, so when people want to utilize xrp for sending between exchanges, they have to pay more fees due to extra  trades on both ends(for example they have to trade trx for eth then to xrp). If xrp is a base pair, this makes the process cheaper on the exchange for the user,s, and Cheaper fees for using the blockchain( xrp is basically free to use).

Works the same way in forex markets with currencies.... ",18-12-24-18-27,12,3458,mikenard77,a92xsf
14848,"It means that to buy other coins you don’t have to go from XRP to BTC then BTC to the alt coin. 

This kept BTC volume (number of coins bought and sold) artificially high. 

So now to buy TRX one could transfer xrp to binance and then buy TRX, for example. No need to ever change to BTC. 

Edit - this is good for xrp holders as they will save fees and time. When buying/selling other coins. As same works in reverse.",18-12-24-18-27,8,2877,tafjangle,a92xsf
14849,"It means that now you don’t have to switch to BTC or ETH if you want to trade TRX or XZC.

XRP as a base pair means that people can now buy XRP (as the base) to trade/buy/sell other cryptos (in this case, TRX or XZC)

This means more liquidity for XRP and less BTC dominance in the overall market.",18-12-24-18-27,7,310,pauly_jay,a92xsf
14850,"This is very useful for people who want to buy TRX with USD or Euros. Often times the exchange that sells TRX doesn’t take credit cards or wire transfers. So, to buy TRX today, the best way to do it would be USD/Euro -> XRP on Bitstamp, then send that XRP to Binance, then XRP -> TRX on Binance. Thousands of people doing this every day will increase XRP demand and volume. ",18-12-24-18-27,2,135821,CaptainRelevant,a92xsf

14853,"XRP being a base also allows for more arbitrage opportunities. If TRX/XRP is 1:1 on one exchange and 1:0.9 on another, due to the speed of XRP you can very quickly take your TRX, sell it on the high exchange for XRP then move it to the low exchange and buy back more TRX. What can occur with XRP in seconds takes BTC and Eth minutes.

>You have to remember that Ripple is only one company building on the XRP ledger and there are more. I think what Coil is doing is also really exciting. They are basically providing an alternative to how the web is monetized with ads and replacing it with streaming micro payments instead. The idea of it is cool it will be interesting to see if it gains traction. Also Omni, where you can basically rent out your tangible assets to other people when you are not using them to make money/xrp. R3 is now able to use XRP in their Corda Settler as well. More use cases and companies building on the XRPL are expected to arise so it's not just limited to Ripple and Banks. Not sure if that helps you understand XRP any more at all but just think of it as a bridge asset that is liquid and can help speed up transactions while minimizing costs.

But srsly Vitalek has a utility that only makes sense in a very niche market. DAPPS are great but universal adoption seems unlikely.

Garlinghouse has a clear vision for Xrapid that makes sense to me.

Most important, I don’t think the global Fiat economy is going to collapse and I think it’s shortsighted to create a system that relies on that.

A cryptocurrency that facilitates fast global liquidity, however, makes a TON of sense to me. 

And because it’s a decentralized blockchain currency, it also has the potential to retain value in the event of an economic collapse. Which, again, I don’t believe will happen. (The economy may become recessed or depressed but fiat is never going to just go away.)

ETH’s biggest promise is dapp development and a new currency.

XRP’s biggest promise is a cheap, fast and simplified system of global liquidity.

I chose the former for the hype; I choose the latter for the utility.

- Short TL:DR: 

Lots of factors point to XRP being a prime candidate for the one world currency though the vote is still out. Even if it doesn't win that particular slot XRP will be the global transfer currency. It's already been decided by the global elite.

- Longer TL:DR 

BTC is heavily manipulated in part because it was never meant to actually succeed but was created by the global elite to be a bridge to get people used to the idea of digital currency. 

The world elite have wanted a one world currency (OWC) for decades to help stabilize the global economy. Ripple has people and ties to all these global organizations that have presided over the direction of money in the past. 

XRP is being positioned to become this OWC. Although the FED may try to position their own OIL backed crypto to be that OWC with XRP just acting as the global bridge currency. However doing such a thing still presents the U.S. with the Triffin dilemma that has destroyed the dollar. Being a country that holds the global reserve currency grants lots of power to that country but at the same time is never sustainable and ultimately quite harmful to that country domestically. Having an independent entity (Ripple/XRP) hold the global reserve currency solves this dilemma.

On the contrast, if there's a huge drop in price you've set yourself up haha. But I guess for a long-term hodler none of those prices matter. I guess for someone like me, who likes to buy crypto often but not in large sums, those fees would start to add up.

Someone correct me if I’m wrong but Ripple releases 1 Billion XRP a month (not per year) (and if they don’t sell all 1 Billion in the month then the unsold/donated XRP just goes back into escrow). This means all of Ripples escrowed XRP should be released in about 6 years from now (not 58 years from now). They also say Nano (nanu nanu I’m Mork from Ork) is faster than XRP, which may be true at the moment but will likely not be the case once Cobalt is released. “Ripple Cobalt will reduce this time to one second or less.” In addition, although many financial institutions may eventually hold XRP that is not the goal of XRP when it comes to cross boarder bank transactions. The idea that the banks care if Ripple owns a significant percentage isn’t relevant and unlikely to affect their decision to use it since the banks simply don’t need to hold the XRP they use for more than a few seconds. It’s irrelevant who on Earth has the most XRP. Many institutions and individuals will hold XRP, who cares who has the most. And as stated, Ripple will only own the most for a few more years then their escrow will be exhausted.

15942,People are saying that there will be a market for all kinds of coins or whatever in the future. I honestly start to think that XRP will become the biggest by far and having multiple use cases built on it. I think this because the liquidity would be so much higher on XRP than on any else crypto that it would make most sense to just build on XRP from the start. If XRP becomes the global standard in cross-border payments the liquidity would be extreme compared to the rest of the coins.

It's easy to feel like it's well know online, particularly as a Redditor as the early adopters have brought in primarily more younger crowds than traditional stocks have-- but we're a *tiny* bubble and indoctrinated with content and news; gives somewhat of a false sense of how well know it is.

One odd thing I've found is that the more I learn about XRP and the banking industry the more confident I become in it.  But you have to approach it with an open mind and try to be objective. Taking Suzie's $589 prediction at face value is a good sign you're not evaluating claims objectively—for example, her calculations ignore the fact that each XRP can be used more than once per year. Also, she praised Verge and was bullish about it too, so context is important.

I once had a wonderful conversation with a banking exec about digital assets and he echoed exactly what you said. He thought XRP would win out, but there will be difficult challenges related to regulation and transitioning banks from correspondent banking to digital assets (correspondent banks aren't just going to let their customer banks flirt with their competition without any consequences). But, if you don't go into these kinds of discussions with an open mind, you won't learn much and will probably be less *truly confident*. ",18-12-21-02-42,4,1791,psyentist15,a7z45y

Yeah, but what you're learning is probably not actual on-the-ground experience of how banks / FIs actually operate.

Like do you have a feeling how fast banks are to move to new technologies? What steps are involved, technically, legally, regulatorily, operationally, accounting-wise, etc? If they're even allowed (by internal rules) to get involved in this sort of technology change? How much of a cost / time savings they'd have to gain in order to be interested in investigating the technology?

Those are all of the things that *truly* matter, and aside from getting statements from people in the industry (which are thin on the ground), I don't think online research and learning more about the Ripple technology gives a true perspective on how likely they are to genuinely succeed.",18-12-21-02-42,0,11,froggleblocks,a7z45y

I don't know what you're learning, which is why I said ""probably not"".

>You must be omniscient to evaluate how useful a stranger's conversation was with another person you know next to nothing about!

No, because I said ""probably not"". You should read what people write because it conveys what they mean to say, instead of imagining what they wrote. Also if it was only a single conversation with one person, then again what I said is likely to be true because a single person's view is unlikely to reflect the whole industry.

>And half of what you talked about isn't relevant to a speculator. If it saves banks plenty of money and regulation becomes clearer, why the hell do I need to worry about how accounting needs to adapt?

Seems you've completely misunderstood my point.

Those are all things (at the very least) that banks need to work through before they can adopt a new technology like Ripple's. And the bigger the bank, the longer these things will take to work through and the more complex they will be. Some banks will decide that it is just Too Hard. Other banks will think it is worth the effort and begin the journey, but we don't know how long it will take before they will be fully utilising Ripple's technology, or how long it will take (if they ever achieve it) where they move to using Ripple as their primary FX technolgoy - just like we know there are lots of xCurrent customers but very few xRapid customers.

Obviously ultimate uptake and speed of uptake is relevant to speculators - if it takes 10 years for XRP to go up to $5 due to adoption being slow, then that is relevant.

>A bunch of the other questions (e.g., cost and time savings) are already well-documented.

Yes, the costs and time-savings are known.

What *I said* is that you likely don't know what costs and time savings need to be relevant for a bank to be interested in moving to the new technology. If they calculate that the cost of moving to the new technology is (say) $1M all up, and the savings are $50k per year, then they might conclude that it's not worth them moving to Ripple - or they might want to find some third party offering that could reduce the implementation costs for them.",18-12-21-02-42,0,11,froggleblocks,a7z45y

Note: I‘m only doing this for fun, not for religious following purposes, lol

He‘s pointing at 589 and also at one of his teeth (can‘t see which one) which could mean he‘s giving us a month when it could happen in 2019.

On the panel there‘s BG with the king in the castle and a checkmark on the right which could mean that it has been confirmed during this bear market (?) that xrp really is the king of crypto currencies.

The king in the presents could mean that we‘ll get a nice christmas present (with xrp reaching new hights? New banking partners being confirmed?)

The Knight on the right looks kinda sad to me, probably because he lost his „right hand“ (under the panel. Probably we‘ll see a change in the board members..?

There‘s something on top of the shelf (looks like a phone screen..?) but I can‘t see it due to low resolution on my phone.

Pretty sure there‘s also something hidden in the calendar and the „building“ on the fire place, but can‘t see that either.

The recycling of all the cryptos I‘m not sure about. The recycling machine is being operated by someone in a suit, so my uneducated guess would be that crypto gets adopted by institutional investors and that they‘ll present crypto as something „brand new“ and „revolutionizing“ as soon as they invested in it.

The court hammer over the fireplace seems „blocked“ to me, so that could symbolize ETFs being delayed to february.

I also noticed that there‘s a coin over one of the books in the shelf. The resolution is really bad so I‘d say itms ethereum...? Can someone see what the book below says/what the title is?

A year ago you couldn't post **anything** about XRP on /r/cryptocurrency without being downvoted. That sentiment has completely flipped and while it's still not 'popular' you're seeing a lot less FUD and generally comments are silently upvoted or ignored. It's harder to deny the facts surrounding XRP. But the issue, and ultimately the irony, is that the tribalism has been a major force in actively *suppressing* adoption of blockchain. From an outsider prospective, the community is extremely immature, tribal and it's a token vs. token. That's the worse possible mindset for disruptive technology. You **want** successful competition, as it creates legitimacy. (Completely different, but it's a growing market that is brand new) Likely PSVR wouldn't exist without Oculus or Vive. Especially in the case of Vive and Oculus; they are directly competing, which encourages adoption, further innovation of the technology, etc.

Also escrow negates the possibility of dumping. If ripple uses xrp in a way the community did not agree with, they can pass an amendment to exclude ripples Holdings.

Xrp can also be sent directly between institutions for a direct payment on xcurrent, an institution can buy the destination currency off an xrapid user trough, or an institution could send xrp directly to another ripple net(xcurrent/xvia) user, for them to pay another user in the needed currency through( doing what xrapid does but without exchanges)

Ripple is not a company that they have obligations to show info.

In those AMA’s, most of the people will not be satisfied because they expect Brad say things like customer names, XRP price predictions, when moon, etc.

But, I think they find this sessions to give some REAL perspective. I’ll resume what I read from this AMA:

•	⁠we have a 4rth exchange as xRapid partner. Bitstamp. Maybe they don’t find another good time to show this in the past;
•	⁠they explain about companies developing in XRP Ledger, like Coil and xPrings (with looks like one of the xPring development bring this travel agency). BUT he doesn’t speak about R3. With in my view, they are one real competitor to Ripple, using XRP.
•	⁠I don’t remember Brad saying about SBI. So I presume they are totally independent and could invest in the XRP ecosystem by them own;
•	⁠They expect customer growth exponentially in FY19 as well at least more than FY18;
•	⁠They are proud to move from one product to 3, and with customers using it;
•	⁠I do believe they are planning more products;
•	⁠Company move from 250 to almost 300 employees;
•	⁠He like to continuing giving Ripple XRP stats besides they are not obligated to;

So, in my opinion, things are moving very, very great, It’s clear that FUD bothers him, is in his face. But when he talks about Ripple development, he smile again and talk like a child, specially about blockchain and “hope for the best”.

16580,"On your last point, it's largely why he, Cory and ultimately Ripple have distanced themselves from XRP; Ripple's ultimate success is derived from XRP volume, but with the state of the ecosystem of crypto, it's tribalistic, still immature, and emotional; it takes balls to correct yourself, to paraphrase-- ""institutional adoption of *Blockchain* didn't happen in 2018 as I predicted-- however Ripple has continued to grow, their partnerships exceeded expectations and projects are flourishing."" 

The take away is that he's frustrated in the cryptoverse being the direct cause for Blockchain adoption *being* slow. The community, lack of regulatory certainty, the tribalism is bad for the *technology,* which everyone seems to forget. Blockchains success won't ride on the shoulders of a single token. And while BTC continues to have big dick contests and fork, Ripple and Brad ignore that and focus on actually providing utility. It's like most tokens are still in the ""proof of concept"" stage, where as Ripple is so far beyond that but is staggered slightly because of the current state of the industry.

Ultimately this is expected of any disruptive new tech, but with Blockchain it's especially rough because it's filled with incredible misinformation, uncertainty and just downright incorrect information; (I mean people are sick of hearing the same answers, how sick do you think he is giving them, the decentralized FUD **is still** tossed around even though it's undeniable, and was literally one of their first goals this year; it requires special mental gymnastics or again, tribalism to claim such nonsense) most people who are long on BTC **cannot** give you a good reason why. Other than they may have gotten rich off it, or it's just useful as a store of value. But as soon as utility provides *more* value then perception those coins are toast. 

He brings up the .com era because this will mirror that imo; it's a gold rush and many tokens are realizing that they don't provide any actual solutions and can't ride on speculation forever. ConsenSys is scrambling as they are laying off 13% of their staff, so many tokens fail to treat it *like a business*, something Ripple has masterfully done; instead they went in on the hype of the tech without a proper focus and it will lead to their demise.

xRapid is supposed to solve the liquidity issue of nostro vostro right? But how would xRapid solve that if the bank now has to keep that money (like you or I would) on an exchange?

I was involved in BTC in the early days, but more from a utility/tech perspective.  After a while, I thought that that community was getting toxic (though, in retrospect, I see that as being more a side effect of being in a bear market), so I jumped ship to the dogecoin community, because they were at least tongue-in-cheek about their crypto.

I mined and bought that for about a year, before forgetting about it.

Then in around May 2017, /r/Ripple was a featured subreddit, and having run a business with an international cofounder that I needed to regularly send money to, I _got_ XRP.  It had a clear use that I understood, better than any other cryptocurrency I saw to date.

I sold all my doge for XRP, and continued to regularly buy XRP for the past 1.5 years.  Even in the beginning, I knew that the daily remittance rate was high, which meant that XRP had a real shot at $100+ prices.  

Knowing that is what kept me holding through the doldrums of mid-2017, the crazy price increase of December 2017, and the bear market of this year.",18-12-19-15-06,1,6500,thekiyote,a7ivyx
