* Partnerships mean nothing, anyone can get one. Just yesterday I walked into the lobby of Microsoft, filled out the partnership form and got one. It's not like these multi-nationals have their legal and risk management teams run thorough audits and compliance checks. I should know, I have a Masters Degree in Businessing Well from Trump University.
* Everyone is raving about the disaster recovery plan Vechain passed like its some huge deal. Too bad that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), who implemented the plan, is a scam company run by the guy who Sunny Lu buys his coffee from. This info was sourced directly from industry insider Ifuckeduremomgood who is an accredited user on the world renowned business information repository known as 4chan.

I sold my 5 VEN yesterday and I advise you all do the same. Consider re-investing in Dump Coin (DPC). Anyone remember that site ratemypoo.com? Well imagine being able to share and rate the morning dumps of others via a decentralised network powered by Dump Coin. Conservative prediction of DPC price by EOY is $5,000USD.

As the original intention of setting up the Rewards structure is to grant Power to all VET holders, mostly, individual token holders. Hence, to begin 2018, the Foundation decided to allocate 150 million VET possessed by Foundation into THOR Power Reward Pool. All THOR Power generated from the Pool will be used to reward VeChain Node holders. The allocated VET in THOR Power Reward Pool reduces by 25 million every 6 months, until further notice after 2019*.

so after a few years node holders wont receive any extra % for owning a node right?  cause the article says every 6 months they will reduce the vet in thor power reward pool with 25 million. so you get 3 years a bonus % thorpower for your node then it stops right? then you get only rewarded thorpower based on the vet tokens you own.",18-03-11-06-32,1,20,mikebarbosa1990,83hdok

541,The price of Thor IMO will be the #1 driver for why VET either rises or falls in price.  If VeChain is going to adjust the supply of Thor to keep price stable and keep supply in line with demand then we have no hope for Thor's price increasing and driving VET's price up.  If Thor is priced at $1/Thor then I have a feeling we're screwed.  I hope Thor is price at $10/Thor or more because if Thor is cheap then companies won't be driving up the price of VET to generate their Thor because they'll settle for the cheap Thor.  ,18-03-11-06-32,1,339,fantasy_football_nut,83hdok

At the moment a node costs around $20,000 with a “generous” estimate of a $1000/yr THOR production.
That’s a 5% return every year for a $20,000 initial investment. Albeit, it would take around 20yrs to make back the initial in terms of income, 6000 VET could easily be worth more by that time.

Also, there is no guarantee that per THOR would be worth $1 could be more could be less. It’s an investment for the future and an incentive for “locking” in the supply.

Say you like VeChain but don't want to go all in. So you just buy 6000 VET to get a X node. 

That means you get higher priority later on. So if VeChain takes off, you can use the 6000 VET x node benefits to get in on that BitOcean ICO. 

BitOcean ICO sells out fast but thanks to that X node you got in.

BitOcean becomes very popular and getting in that ICO pays off.

Poor people going all in on a 6000 VET X node hoping to get rich off THOR is unlikely.

932,"Vechain does not only provide counterfeit protection. It also adds value for supply chain data and for example temperature control... that’s why every company with a big supply chain could possibly benefit from Vechain!

934,"It is easy to justify.  I was purely a stock market investor before last year. I watched Bitcoin in 2013-2014, and put some play money in Bitcoin and Ethereum last year, but didn't really believe in them or know how to value them. I also thought every alt coin was a complete joke, and that there would be a crash.

That all changed with Vechain. I invested heavily into Vechain, and have only increased with the announcements from Jim Breyer, DNV GL, and PWC.  Their due diligence on Vechain's technology, people, and potential valuation should provide you with a ton of comfort.

There is no other asset out there with this kind of risk to reward, whether the price is $.01 to $.10. I can clearly see how they are building their business model and addressing real needs within supply chains, and with PWC and DNVGL they have huge, mature companies onboarding clients for them. 

I don't know what the ultimate value of VET will be. I feel very strongly that it has the potential to reach $1 (old VEN $100) within the next 3-5 years.  There is simply no other investment that I can make that offers that kind of return with the level of risk that I perceive. 

These markets are awful, which is why I wanted to avoid them in the first place. But I couldn't and can't help myself with Vechain. Of course, buying in at $4 is a lot worse than $1, but the risk on the other side was never getting on board at all.

Everyone was panicking and saying sell! I’ll admit, it was gut wrenching watching my $$ get cut in half (much worse for Vechain now). But! It turned around and look at Apple now, $207! From fetal position to glory.

Point of the story is this, investments like this will absolutely swing (positive and negative). You have to be strong and just understand that this is the nature of the beast. Once you can handle this fact, enduring down trends in your investments will be a lot easier, and fun for you. 

A second option, if you want to get out off this emotional rollercoaster, is the triple down on your position, lowering your $average and then sell as soon as you reach a level of loss (say 5% down) and just cut your loses. Consider it a $500 lesson learned.
 
Last point, compare these two positions:

1- watching your investment shrink but still staying in the game or

2- selling your investment for a loss, but then seeing the price of VET in 2 years and realizing you could have been filthy rich but you were to emotional to stay in the game.

Had to sell some matrix, which made me sad, but previously I would have had to sell it all and still not had enough!

Listen, chin up and eyes on the prize. You need to have larger balls if you really believe in not only Vechain but also Crypto. I don't know how this ride will end for sure, but I've put in the time to know the following:

1. It's a new technology that disrupts old industry's that have been stagnant for some time in certain aspects like inventory management along with the mountains of paperwork that come with it. This is something you look for in any emerging tech.
2. The team is a great team, headed by a great CEO in Sunny. They have a lot of experience, which is what you want when it comes to software.
3. They have better partnerships confirmed by those partners than most other crypto projects. 
4. Some of their major partners bought equity in them. This is a good indication there's a lot of good happening behind the scenes.
5. They have some huge investors backing them. 

I'm not going to take the time to write out every detail of these points, as you can find them on this sub. If you're new, simply check this sub for reference. I don't know what the future holds for Vechain and crypto, but I think it has a lot of potential. Only time will tell.

The ONLY opportunities for massive gains (like 10x or higher) is in these situations where pretty much everyone is dumping but only a select few continue to have faith in the possible fundamentals.

VeChain didn't token split at 1:100 so that 1 VTHO or 1 VET could be a single cent.  

Simple maths based on the 20b revenue figure and the generation rate of VTHO leads me to believe that VTHO could reach $1 and VET a similar price (or more depending on the ROI investors seek).

I am a bag holder with the majority of others here but I have been consistent with my approach to valuing VET since first investing.

My brother in law’s role at BMW is this exactly

I’m sure he doesn’t know anything about this stuff yet, but I can guarantee if VeChain becomes a BMW reality, he’ll be using it every day

Edit (x2): Sorry, I just realized I didn’t go into detail. BMW probably doesn’t manufacture every single part itself, and even those it does require raw materials. VeChain would assure accuracy of serial/batch numbers, place of origin, date of manufacture, and basically anything else you’d want to know about the history of a part or batch of parts, down to who inspected them and at what point(s) in the supply chain.

Increases transparency between BMW and its vendors, as well as much improved traceability. 

An example might be: BMW gets partX from multiple vendors. About halfway through the model year, they discover that a percentage of BMW’s sold are experiencing partX failures. Excellent traceability could narrow the problem down to a specific vendor and/or run of partX, saving potentially millions in recall costs. Furthermore, the vendors can’t lie about the origin of parts, or potential known issues - liability protection for BMW ",18-02-20-11-34,20,1117,hopsbarleyyeastwater,7yrpm7

It was all just stamps and filling out the same damn forms, digitally and physically.

The way I see it the block chain would be a one stop shop i guess but still manipulated by the data I would have put in.

In that industry the more important aspects where integrity of the part eg magnaflux, either fail or not.

I may be shortsighted I cant see what huge benefit it would be other than being in a single decentralised source(still an advantage), data entry for the QA would still be the same, that's just policy.

Once they narrow down a specific part or system, they could look at the blockchain record of everywhere that system had been, who had inspected it, date of manufacture, last overhaul/repair, etc. The blockchain aspect means that the repair shop or replacement PMA part manufacturer who realized they half-assed or missed something along the way can’t dig up the paperwork and change anything once they’ve signed off on it. It keeps everyone accountable and ensures if someone does fuck up, they have to fall on the sword. 

RFID tags on systems would also be able to replace stamped or printed tags, and when scanned would contain info like date of manufacture, date of last overhaul, where it was overhauled, the mechanic who overhauled it, etc, and could even link to the overhaul record itself, which would replace the necessity to maintain and pass along paper records (which can get lost, damaged, be time consuming to dig up, etc).",18-02-20-11-34,8,1117,hopsbarleyyeastwater,7yrpm7

There are a bunch of people here who are mad that you won't take that word at law but they are emotionally invested bagholders.

Here are the facts:

There is no hard evidence that enterprises will use Vechain yet. There are rumours and partnerships but you are right to be skeptical of them; having a partnership in crypto is like saying you're a ""hard worker"" on your resume. We also don't know the scope of these partnerships and if they will yield a decent return on investment. Stellar Lumens has been closely involved with IBM for a while now and it still moves with BTC like every other alt coin.

There doesn't seem to be much activity on either testnet or mainnet yet. Both are under 25K total transactions since mainnet activated. This doesn't inspire confidence in me when people in this and other subs are claiming that this will be the most used Blockchain by end of 2019.

If you're sitting on the sidelines, I'd honestly hold off until Q4 to see if anything materializes. If you're already invested and nothing materializes by then, drop it if nothing materializes. Maybe your return won't be as explosive but you limit your risk. ",18-08-04-18-48,3,0,[deleted],94hry5

1467,"You're assuming the only benefit is to the end purchaser. There are a lot of industrial uses where the end consumer doesn't need to know but the retailer/manufacturer does. If you purchase food from a grocery store in the U.S. then you are likely to just trust it because most of us haven't been burned before. But what if you were in charge of purchasing large quantities of food on behalf of others from foreign suppliers. Are you going to stake your job and other peoples health on the fact that you haven't been burned before or would you rather know exactly where this food comes from? This is just one example.

And back to consumer uses, if instead of America you live in some place like China, counterfeit foods is a big deal. Check out the 2008 chinese baby food scandal. 300,000 estimated victims. Here is a quote from wikipedia below:

1765,"Two quick counterpoints. First, by having a relatively low number of validation nodes, those node holders will have a significant incentive to both secure and promote the VeChain platform. That is because the node holders will be handsomely rewarded if the VeChain network is widely used, and it will be widely used only if the network is shown to be secure, and properly promoted. This incentive should be high enough to outweigh any benefits from colluding with other node holders. And I'm sure that there is some protocol in place to make each node as safe from attack as possible. 

Second, the number of authority-node holders can increase over time. For that to happen, all that is needed is for the economic-node holders to vote on it, and the steering committee to implement it. So if having only 101 does appear to be problematic, the economic-node holders can solve that problem by increasing the number of authority nodes. ",18-05-19-00-06,6,3032,bentaylor84,8kdffd

What is important for enterprises with regards to blockchain?  Writing to an immutable record, quick transactions, and reliability are the top things that come to mind.  You may say there is incentive to cheat, but a look at game theory would show that it is not worth the risk.  
If a node is a bad actor and gets removed, it loses a large amount of revenue.  If you somehow get 51 different and consecutive entities and reputable people to all agree to take a hit on their reputation - without anyone reporting it, mind you - your blockchain is in trouble anyways.

Slow by who’s standards? There is no other Blockchain to make such a comparison with. We have ICOs launching as we speak, and if you refer to the whitepaper, Q4 2018 was when the final completion of the chain is due with child chains and side chains being added. We will see more activity this quarter with 2019/2020 being when the product can properly get on its feet. If you look at vechain’s own forecasts, they see 2021 as the growth phase with 2019/2020 being the years in which the world sees major Blockchain regulation.

Everything has a slight undertone of negativity. It was quite surprising to read, but then it makes more sense if your heart lies there more, which, may I add, is not a negative. You are entitled to make whatever choices you please. It was notable, was all. 

But ultimately, your assumptions are still baseless I’m sorry to say. I asked for data and you gave none. That’s my only gripe. It’s one thing being polarised one one side of the fence or the other, to to make statements without facts backing it up is damaging. Whether intentional or not.

It’s much harder to combat ‘bullshit’ (so to speak, I’m not saying what you’re saying is) once it has taken root within the public narrative, whether true or not.

BTW, Vechain is my largest holding. I want it to succeed. I just think we are still in the very high risk stage.

I am positive on TE-FOOD because they are the antithesis to a mega-hype project. They are small, they issue a roadmap and they deliver against it well. On current performance, I expect them to have more transactions on their main net at the end of the year than Vechain (and they haven't launched their main net yet).

Is just one relevant paper. 

I have been here for a very long time. Of course their marketing has had an impact on the community, but for me, my optimism comes from having read all the information we were given: software, hardware and business AMAs, reading up on their technology, MPP being a major one, learning about their all star team, their huge array of connections, poring over the whitepaper. Ive not been fed an opinion to become an auto shill. 

The materials that are out there have their own merit outside of the marketing and buzzwords. CCK is all fun, but no, that’s not where my confidence comes from. It’s from research, reading about other projects in the space and realising the vast majority do not even come close to VeChain’s potential.

We know the chain is due to get more active in Q4, we have ICOs coming online right now and more instances of traffic on the Blockchain itself. We are already seeing more use. Their road map actually has 2021 as their ‘growth phase’ with the next two years forecast as the regulation years, so again, I’m not concerned with the short term. They list 2025 as maturity. That’s actually quite normal in the business world - 7 years to reach maturity. Things take a long time out there. Again, not supposition, that’s a fact. That’s why Jim Breyer invests with 7-10 year time frames in mind. 

Anyway, we’re both on the same team, but as someone who has been kicking around for so long, I find it disheartening when people come along and trash the progress that aren’t applying their own due diligence. You could have answered your own question if you’d bothered to look it up (about no proof RE businesses moving slow).

And that’s good to hear about TE-FOOD. Honestly, I don’t like the flashy showmanship of many projects either, which is another reason I don’t quite get your line of reasoning because I don’t actually see VeChain as being like that. CCK was a bit of fun, riddles for the community, it builds engagement. Announcing partnerships is just marketing 101, who wouldn’t. It’s not like TRON, announcing the announcement of an announcement or using buzzword bingo. 

Well, maybe we just see things differently on that last point. 

Anyway, you are right to err on the side of caution, but that doesn’t mean you have to skew everyone else’s thoughts too. You influence people whether you realise it or not. I’ve noticed you for a little while now, and I rarely see you say anything positive about the project.

Do you keep as up-to-date on other startups or even major companies and their press-statements?

The kind of marketing that VeChain does, the PR pieces on yahoo finance, or bloomberg, or nasdaq, is what most major companies do. Statements like ""the king witnessed"" are not only correct and appropriate to the context, but completely normal and expected in normal business communication, especially chinese business.

Spending time in this industry as an investor leads to the growth of a super high bullshit-filter in anyone. But its good to ground that filter in reality, VeChain really doesnt do much different in terms of marketing than major firms. VW today put out a statement saying ""in 2020 we will cars as good as Tesla for half the price"", is that fluff marketing and crap and unproffesional and shady? No, because thats what you do as company, you announce stuff you will or want to do in the future, to attract customers, get attention and grow your mindshare.

When you sign a partnership agreement or contract, any company puts out a statement like that, its completely weird that that has suddenly become a point of FUD against VeChain ""They signed a partnership and put out a medium, they should shut up and just build it!"" why? this is a very relevant piece of info to investors, Not only does this build a proper image of capabilities for customers, but it keeps investors up to date on tangible growth.

I am invested in other businesses, but not as many start ups. But I have seen many successful start ups over the years and the type of coverage that they get from a media perspective. Almost always, the successful ones are being reported on, and not doing the reporting themselves. 

Most major companies do not do this in the form of their own paid opinion pieces. For big announcements, they always have third-party coverage in multiple news outlets. Saying something like ""the king witnessed"" is an attempt to add legitimacy. If it was so important that it involved the king, then this would be written about in various news outlets in the respective country.  If it wasn't important enough for that, then it doesn't matter that the king witnessed it. It is an attempt to ""fluff"" the post.

If you want to back this up, please provide proof of similar marketing attempts by other major firms and I will provide a counter argument if there is any. VW is a billion $ company and has proven its legitimacy; they have the room to make a statement like that. Also this is probably a single quote taken from an executive and written about in a third party article. I hardly think this is the same form of marketing as what I was explaining. And it doesn't matter for the other reasons I posted.

I agree that the company puts out a statement. But the way VeChain writes their statements is like it is some huge development. And if that's the case, why is it that the other party rarely puts out a statement? It's only VeChain putting out the statement the large majority of the time. Occasionally this is different such as when DNV GL makes a post as well, and under those circumstances it is acceptable for VeChain to do so.

VeChain is very good at making crypto startup nonsense look like it is good business language.

2178,"My thoughts is that it's incorrect. 

""Vechain is going to be huge but investors will get hurt.""

This isn't possible. Everyone that hold VET will generate Thor power. So as long as companies uses the platform we will se a demand of Thor power. Because the Thor power VET holders receive is based on supply, consumption and price. So the amount of THOR that is total rewarded will have a demand. It is possible that VET is overvalued and we all ""lose"" from holding VET because of low demand.

If VeChain is going to be huge the demand of Thor power will be huge and because of high demand of Thor power, VET will also increase in value. VeChain can't be huge without an increase in demand of Thor power, everything is connected.

It might be some flaws in the beginning but when VeChain as a platform matures we will se more stability. No need to worry as long as you believe in VeChain.",18-03-14-23-43,15,1,medijoker-media,84d2r7
2179,"but with increased adoption, the demand of Thor will increase, the amount of Thor generated from a VET token might be revised to increase for this demand. 

thor prices stay the same, but you generate more of it and sell more of it ( aka profit).

2180,"The authority nodes all have to register and will be identified to and approved by the VeChain Foundation. I have no doubt their wallets will be monitored and they will be forbidden from, and will be penalized for, selling their VET in such a way that it undercuts the market and undermines the entire economic ecosystem.  I think it's pretty silly to assume PwC, VeChain and Oxford University (the group working on the economics) didn't think about this and aren't accounting for it in some way.


Plus, I'd wager that ultimately the majority of the authority nodes are going to be the companies that are the largest/major THOR consumers themselves.  They aren't going to be selling it, they're going to be using it.  This is part of what's going to ultimately drive the price of VEN/VET up - enterprises realizing the one time cost of buying VEN/VET and setting up a node/nodes to generate THOR is much cheaper than buying THOR on an as needed basis indefinitely.  If VeChain becomes as big as I think it's going to be, and there's as much demand for THOR as I think there's going to be, the price of VEN/VET is going to get much higher as enterprises compete to buy it so they can generate THOR indefinitely.


Also, this ""flaw"" assumes that the sale of the VET tokens generated/earned by the authority nodes willing to sell will actually be enough to put downward pressure on the market, i.e. that the demand won't be high enough for this to be a non-issue.

2181,"If the VeChain foundation does increase the supply of THOR, it will do so by increasing the number of THOR that VET generates. That increases the value of your VET. 

In fact, I actually hope they do this. It would stabilize THOR prices by telling investors that THOR is not an investment. That stabilization will make VeChain more valuable bacause entities are more likely to use blockchain technology if they can predict upfront the cost of using the technology.

2185,"This ""flawed cryptonomics"" makes sense to me. It is not a coinicidence that Vechain is trying to lock up VEN in the XNodes and distribute higher % of THOR. There is going to be an avenue for companies to by-pass VEN and purchase THOR directly. 


Q11. “Is it possible for enterprise business to use the VeChain’s blockchain x without holding VEN/VET ? I understand that VEN/VET holders who earn VETHOR can sell the VETHOR to whoever they want.

It seems that the documents also indicate that VETHOR can be purchased directly from VeChain. Can you confirm ?”

A11: Similar to the question above, if the enterprise user does not want to hold VET, they may engage with a BaaS service provider that uses VeChain. Through a BaaS they can choose to pay fixed fee in fiat currency for the use of the VeChainThor blockchain platform (e.g. fee per product registered on VeChainThor) to you the VET holder, this would appear like businesses are buying VeThor on the open market.

And then Question 12


Q12. Will there be a VeThor only exchange where companies that use thor can buy directly from there and users generating thor can list it directly to that exchange. Maybe even something integrated into the wallet where with a click of a button you can unload your thor at market price. Or are companies and institutions using thor all going to make binance(or other exchange) accounts and buy their thor like the rest of us? In order to buy from this exchange you have to be registered as an institution or partner of VeChain but anyone could sell to it. This would be the baseline demand price of THOR without speculative investors. It would just be what companies using thor are willing to pay for it. I think something like that would create a lot of stability in the price of thor and give it a real value vs a speculative one.

A12: Yes, not this exactly, but something very similar to this will be put into place and is a plan of ours. More details of that will be released at a future date.",18-03-14-23-43,2,1414,osu8ball,84d2r7

Please explain to me how these Authority nodes will ""essentially have a never ending supply of THOR"". And what makes you think they will be selling at a discount?

2189,This is what I was thinking as well.  I guess it would depend on if the rate of production for vet increases or if they give a greater percentage of the used vthor to the 101 masternode holders (right now they get 30% and the rest is burned).

2197,"Well, since you continue to let us know about your 2770 VEN, I feel you are somewhat insecure about it and probably need some reassurance. You are holding a good amount of investment in the project, more than most, and would be in the top 12% of all holders. So, stop worrying about all the blowhards around here talking about the nodes they accumulated as there are very, very few of them and in the end, it likely won't make a huge difference.

I personally believe that IoT is one area that blockchain truly will thrive and is needed, with Vechain being a future leader in this space. However, I do not believe it will be a great investment from a ROI standpoint in the short-mid term as the real value is in Thor and this will need to be kept low to continue being useful for companies. We will no doubt see an increase in the price of VET as BTC increases (if, with mt Gox lingering over our heads through Sept). 

So, holding a few thousand VET in this project is a very good investment amount and enough to see nice gains should this increase in value. It also allows you to not have a much higher amount locked up to place into other projects that will likely increase in value faster in the short term and provide a higher ROI, so if you wanted to place more into VET once we have a better idea of what will happen, you could do so at that time.",18-03-14-23-43,1,113,dras333,84d2r7

2222,"1) About BMW they explained that they were under an NDA but BMW was nice to allow them to mention it on the rebranding event, since the rumors were already quite big / leaked through CCK. As I understand it, the partnership is still under an NDA and that's why we don't get more details about it. The biggest partnerships out there (mainly DNV GL and PWC) have been clearly explained in terms of scope, the projects they are working on, etc. You have not done your research properly if you say that. 

2) That's not Vechain's fault at all IMO. There's also stupid people thinking that by buying XRP you are a stakeholder of Ripple, the company, even though they have repeatedly said so millions of times. Also an important distinction here - Vechain is a foundation not a company. So you are confusing terms here. When you invest in the stock market, of course you are buying shares of that company. But here you're not doing this. The foundation doesn't do what's best for the shareholders (there are none) but does what's best for the Vechain ecosystem on which we are a part of by holding VET. 

3) Again, no stakeholders here... The rebranding was to make it official that VeChain will now be VeChain Thor and thus start working on revamping their whole concept: from a private blockchain to a decentralized ecosystem platform that will keep doing its cold-chain logistics purpose, but also add dapps, a new 2-token economic system, and much more. So I beg to differ that ""only the name changed"". The first three dapss were announced, a partnership with Oxford (some problems there but whatever), a new initiative with DNV GL about carbon emissions... c'mon man did you even see the video?

4) I partly agree here - I'd like more info as to the additional benefits that being an X node will bring. But to me the 50M VET that they'll look and give all that generated Thor back to the X node holders is already a pretty powerful benefit. I'd like to see more info on that mention of exclusive participation rights, whitelists, and so on though. But they stated that the main purpose is for them to get a better idea of how many nodes will be when the mainnet will launch in Q2 (and thus they can start working on analysis that surely will be beneficial for their planning) and also help stabilize the volatile market as more tokens will be locked.

5) People could seriously do a bit of research before opening yet the 200th new post about it...but I guess you're also partially right here. A clear step-by-step guide would have been useful. Still, they know that's why Reddit, telegram etc is there to help out the lost ones.

6) See my previous responses about being a stakeholder. It just doesn't apply at all IMO. The only thing that exists here are the 101 Authority Nodes (the most important ones), and lower Economic nodes, and now the X Nodes. They all play a part and it's been described by them quite clearly.

7) Until we know who CCK is (if we ever) you can't pin it on them. How is that their fault? As some redditors pointed out, the writing style of CCK - especially on 4chan using some racial slurs - makes me believe this is NOT organized by Vechain at all. Maybe they allowed it somehow as a marketing strategy? Who knows. It was fun though so I don't think it's such a big thing.

8) You are part of the project as long as you invest in it. Not sure what you mean by ""being a money supplier"". If you buy the tokens they are yours, it's not like the money goes to them man.. you can just basically say the same about every other crypto there...

Wait, no I don't, because I was never that naive, nor was I ever silly enough to think that the communication to the token holders about the partnerships is more important than the partnerships themselves in the long run, i.e. are a better indicator of whether the company is a serious business with a plausible real world use case.

2239,"LOL. Thank you for a proper response. Let's agree to disagree, point buy point.
1) Rubbish. Which BMW? China? Germany? ""kind enough to disclose but not getting into details""? Then it still holds. Don't create FOMO on a reNAMING event. No confirmation by BMW and a request on a Telgram group not to bother them? Come on. That's amateurs.
2) They should communicate that clearer. I know that you're right but they should make sure that 90% of their coin buyers know it too. They've failed in that matter.
3) It's a re-naming and not a rebranding. FGS it wasn't even a renaming as it still called VET on most exchanges. bad management.
4) X-mode is not a powerful benefit as there is no value attached to it in a measurable sense. ROI is not made clear in any way. Again: be concrete or shut up (seeking to Vechain)
5) Cheers. I think a professional company would do that themselves and not leave it to community members.
6) Sure but that should have been communicated more clearly, which is my point
7) IF he's not an insider, they should make sure he won't cause any disruption anymore. If he's an outsider (which he/she obviously isn't) they should make sure he/she doesn't create anymore FOMO etc. He/she is harming the company and the brand.
8) No you'er not. You invest in an expression of the company, not in the company itself
9) Yes that is bad as it is micro-management by a CEO. Also, how solid is that partnership if it would be compromised by moonboys asking questions to BMW? Oh and which/where BMW?
10) LOL I'm not sore about selling. Getting back in soon as I'm sure if they can make a business case. Which depends on comms/pr as much as on tech :D

- Usually, corporate venture programs are hard to enter. They leave it to VCs to invest in more risky startups based on their thesis. A huge automobile firm wouldn't sign on an agri startup in their venture program.
- The BMW startup garage is tough to enter, and startups are automatically partners, see their website.
- The LVMH wasn't announced as a partnership, not sure where you got that idea, and looking at the program, the requirements are not as tough as BMW's, but, it is still something.
- re 2, interesting question. But looking as to how VeChain will move operations to a public mainnet, it will be kind of inefficient to undo all of it. I'm more interested in how VeChain Foundation charges companies to implement solutions (as this is revenue, but the Foundation is non-profit)
- Pushing themselves as an enterprise dApp/ICO platform, VeChain serves enterprises primarily. I believe this is something the team took into account when forming their vision and strategy.

And why did it lead to this ban? Again thanks for taking the time to explain. ,18-02-08-01-58,4,43,brendandean123,7vwmff
2658,"See this is where the BS comes into play. I have showed multiple times that /r/NanoCurrency and XRB's telegram/discord have done this as well and they have never gotten banned, especially when their community continues to do it even today. The fucked up part is that /r/NanoCurrency is listed under their sidebar under ""Home Subreddits"" and is the only currency that is less than a year old to be on that sidebar. In /r/nanocurrency's case, it is less than 3 months old and to top it off, the first comment in that subreddit was 9 days ago. Hell, there are plenty of older coins that are doing well that aren't on that sidebar as well. 

You can find on occasion what currency the mods on /r/cc hold and XRB is one of them while VeChain, admitted from their own accounts, is not one of them. They have something against VeChain and something should be done about it. VeChain has been dominating XRB in terms of news lately and I believe the mods, or at least some of them, are getting jealous of the uprising of VeChain. Conflict of interest is sky rocketing out the roof with this ban on VeChain and it's absolutely disgusting.

1. A concert is planned.

3. The tickets are transferred to market place wallets and then sold from there.  
4. You buy a ticket, it's transferred to your VeTicket wallet.  
5. You suddenly can't go anymore so you list it on the second hand market place  (think stubhub but without the fees)  
6. You find a buyer and they pay you with crypto (VeTicket wallet luckily has a pay option which connects to your bank account or credit card) and converts to crypto.  
7. A smart contract sends the buyer the ticket and holds the money in escrow until the concert happens. 

* If the concert is cancelled the ticket is refunded and you and the buyer are refunded, you by the concert and the buyer by the smart contract. 
* The buyer goes to the concert, in which case the ticket scanners mark the ticket as used on the block chain and the funds are released to you. (This could be recursive incase the buyer re-sells the ticket again)
* The concert date passes, but the buyer doesn't go, the money is sent to you.

2731,"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

But large scale corporations who are willing to protect their name are really going to invest heavily into this type of technology.

1) Vechain is a legal entity, Shanghai Weilian Information Technology Co. Ltd [Source], and is therefore able to receive payments in fiat.

A1) -


2) Ethereum is the industry standard form of payment. According to their latest Financial Executive Report, VeChain themselves use Ethereum to pay expenses [Source]. If the core company is not using their own currency, why would anyone else.

A2) No the opposite. Using ETH over VEN shows confident in the future value of VEN.


3) The volatility of the VEN makes it a poor store of value.

A3) This argument can be said by every token/crypto out there. However, VeChain has has a twin-token system that moves VET out from exchanges since you are rewarded with Thor in ""right"" wallet. Also nodes thats have a maturation period makes it very risky to move VET if the goal is to manipulate the price or trade. 


4) Exceptionally unbalanced distribution of wealth makes the currency easily manipulated.

A4) Could be said about every crypto/token. However VeChain has a solution to this (see above). 


5) VET has not been tested or proven as cryptographically secure.

A5) It has been tested by PWC in a Cryptocurrency Disaster Recovery Plan (CDRP). But for now thats what we got since main net hasen't been released. 


6) No fiat exchanges (VeChain are working with an ATM company, Bitocean [Source]).

A6) Is this a argument against? He kinda answers it. We also have pairing with KRW now.


7) Tax & regulation issues

A7) Same goes by every crypto/token?


""This is beneficial for businesses using VeChain as the cost of using the protocol should be relatively stable. As an investor this is a huge red flag. This effectively gives them the ability to manipulate the price of their own currency by adjusting the rate of THOR production, the same power as the federal reserve.""
False: The production rate will be controlled by a smart contract and every number will be known to the public.

If you compare blockchain tech to the internet, we're somewhere around 1995 right now and it is extremely difficult to predict which projects are going to be the Lycos, Netscape, Napster, Altavista and who are going to be the Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon of blockchain. Therefore, IMHO instead of cult-like adherence to one project, portfolio diversification is key. Create a portfolio of projects that: 1) Solve a real-world problem in a way you can explain in two sentences to someone who's not into blockchain tech, 2) In one way or the other tap into some kind of unused (economic) potential, 3) Not only have a solid DEV team, but also high-level business management, 4) Have multiple partnerships with multinational corporations, 5) Have a clear white paper and a roadmap with major milestones already achieved and full launch preferably in near-term future, 6) Are traded on at least one or two of the top 5 crypto exchanges. If you create a portfolio with 5-10 coins that meet these criteria, there is a big chance one or two of them will make you a lot of money (potentially a millionaire, depending on the invested capital) while the rest of them most likely fade into oblivion a few years from now.

They just kept interest rates really low for a very long time, some places still have negative interest rates without being able to jump start the economy. The world economy has gone up for 10 years now, almost a record. I think it will be a significant crash coming in the world economy within the next couple of years.

Do you seriously believe that VeChain's network is far superior to others when you talk about scalability, transaction cost, and governance?

VeChain has a completely broken consensus mechanism right now. I say broken, but really, it's unfinished. Proof of Authority requires... well, proof of authority. Currently, there is none.

""With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation.""

2935,"Yes, I fully believe we solved those issues. Transaction cost stability comes via the two token model, no other project has the ability to offer that (altering VTHO burned to maintain transaction cost).

Semi centralisation was done for scalability purposes. We have DNVGL overseeing VeChain as an accredited third party. I can sleep very soundly knowing that - they are THE trust machine for the entire global business ecosystem. They will not sabotage their reputation, so whilst yes, we don’t currently know who all the nodes are, it doesn’t bother me for that reason. We managed to crank out 2million transactions on test net in not even 1 day! That already exceeds Ethereum’ sand Tron’s daily record. We have the capability to far exceed their numbers once things are up and running with MTT/MPP technology.

And yeah Vechain’s governance is the most robust there is. Read the whitepaper about the checks and balances in place, I’m not going to do your research for you. It’s a very comprehensive set up with lots of layers that don’t leave power with any single party. Just read the part about fund management for perspective. We can’t be hard forked, that’s another massive benefit of our system.

All three of my statements are truthful. I have read much of the whitepaper. Precisely why I believe so strongly in VeChain. To me, it’s you who lacks knowledge.

I whole-heartedly agree that there are few authority nodes confirmed (I believe DNV GL may be one?)  but in the end, if DNVGL has faith in what is going on with Vechain, that is good enough for me.

1. Being able to sell an x-node gives it value. It becomes a liquid asset.
2. As investors, being able to dispose of an x-node allows for a concrete exit strategy.

Even back then, it was clear that one would be able to transfer x-node status. Ergo, it can be sold in the secondary market. We didn't expect it to be within the app but hey, that's a quality of life improvement imo. 

Yes, I too believe that there should be more ""perks"" to holding an x-node. However, the main selling point back then, which I bought into, was the increased vethor generation rate. As an investor, it's like buying a special class of shares which has higher dividends.

It sucks now that VET is worth a fraction of the cost back then but truth is, the devaluing of the x-node isn't due to the fact that it can be transferred/sold, it's due to the price of VET being low (and by extension the depressed value generated via VTHOR due to exceedingly high excess generated daily).

Hey we could’ve all held multiple xnodes instead of strength or thunder or mjolnir and sold statuses to everyone else instead of holding a matured node that couldn’t drop below a certain point. 

I hate that they added the vethor xnode of 600k, strength at 1 Mil was a simple fine milestone. Easy to remember. Kept the number of xnodes low. If selling was still added in this scenario, less would change hands as it seems those picking up the cheapest nodes were so quick to sell them off once the auction feature was added.  

Thorblock ICO pool was dumb too bc it allowed a feature of xnodes to be utilized by all users of the pool. 

Most people saying it’s nothing to complain about either bought their holdings at this price last year or just discovered VeChain within a reasonable price range.

The July dump was horrible. “xnode pausing”. Watching as your node (assuming thunder or mjolnir) tumbles from 6 & 7 figure sums to 5 or low 6s. But wait!! VeChain is offering early bird rewards! The day is saved! Here’s a free 1.75% gain on number of coins. Thanks for being loyal and not selling your coins :). Shame on those who sold their xnodes . No 1.75% for them :(.

There’s nothing special about being an xnode holder. 
The first use of the governance model among nodes should’ve been to vote yes/no on xnode auctions. But I’ve yet to see this governance in action.

2) As an x-node holder, you can now sell your status. Early risk takers are rewarded by getting either free money (selling the status) or being able to participate in ICOs (well, only a few of them for some people) with additional benefits.

It is not a one sided affiliation where Vechain is required to do all of the heavy lifting in order to implement into an existing infrastructure. The companies that they pair up with are looking for adoption obviously, but they are betting on Vechain delivering the base system, when it comes to scaling the companies they are partnering with will be in charge of providing the funds and necessary manpower to fully implement it. It's not like vechain is an AC technician coming in to install a new unit. Vechain is the engineer behind the AC unit and the parternships they have formed will act as the technician. So the more parternships Vechain has the more it foreshadows that Vechain is totally capable of handling what they are attempting to take on, not the reverse.",18-02-24-14-23,3,193,Hubbard2596,7ztxw1

Can't keep up with demand. Can't produce enough chips. 

Maybe THOR is price too high due to demand and VET too high. Hard to get chips. Customers may look elsewhere.

Once VeChain can get it set up to where anyone can buy chips easily online and get them shipped to them. Then the customers can buy VET or THOR and start using what VeChain offers.

So hopefully they can keep THOR price low enough to where tons of people buy and run a pilot for their business.

These people running small pilots start expanding. Buying more chips and more THOR and/or VET.

I'm glad they partnered up. If this takes off the demand is going to be huge and they will need to produce a lot of chips.

Yes, you'll have to wait, but you may miss out on more than 10 VEN. If you have an xnode, you're missing out on 0.75% * however much VEN you have now. You'll also lose out on the lottery drawings, which has an expected value of about 10 VEN for people with x nodes.

No, but you have to have enough VET in your VET wallet to qualify for your x node status by August 10, whether or not ledger support is out yet, or else you'll lose your x node status.

3161,Interesting idea. Would be difficult to regulate home pressed ammo though.,18-03-17-09-18,2,12,PhattyMoose,84zccu
3162,Would criminals not just end up making their own bullets or sourcing them through other (possibly illegal) means if they found out bullets could be tracked? It would create a whole host of other problems imo.,18-03-17-09-18,1,4102,wrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,84zccu
3163,"The problem with this idea, as is most gun regulation, is it places a tremendous burden on legal gun owners for little actual benefit.  Less than 20% of gun crime is committed with a legally purchased firearm.  Some where in the realm of 11% of gun murders are committed with a legally purchased firearm.  (These numbers reflect the fact that most gun crime and murders specifically is related to the drug trade.)  Even if these chips are insanely inexpensive, say $5/each, you are going to raise the cost of ammunition, already not cheap, by an immense amount.  A law abiding gun owner who goes to the range once a month or so could be out over $5,000 a year for something that will provide little benefit other than security theater.   It would also require firearm registration to be effective, which has lead to confiscation 100% of the time a government has succeeded in implementing it.

There is a real reason why gun owners are against things like this.  Its not brain washing by the NRA, it's not just to be ass holes, it's because you're proposing something that would greatly erode a fundamental freedom.  It may not be a freedom that is important to you, but it is very important to a large swath of the population.  ",18-03-17-09-18,1,16,yanbu,84zccu
3164,"Of course, as is the argument against gun control, criminals will find ways to do what they do. That being said this would definitely put a stop to a lot of it I would imagine, especially if the criminal has no visually identifiable way of knowing if the bullet is home pressed or factory load with a tracker on it. As in, the criminal will get screwed by his criminal buddy because his criminal buddy is selling factory ammo as black market ammo turning massive profit, and before he can track him down to make even the law already has him in cuffs. I think it's a great idea and in no way would impede on lawful users. So this works for the bullets. 

Just to clarify I do know this doesn't work for the guns, and I'm all for gun rights, but this would be a great mitigation in my opinion. True criminals(career criminals too) do not trust other criminals anymore than they could see someone trusting them. So it would put a big halt on a lot of aspects pertaining to criminal gun violence. 


With all that being said, yeah, home pressed and loaded if you know what you're doing, scrub the serial number and bore/hone out the rifling and you can still be a premiere class criminal.

3167,"There are ten different RFID, NFC, and Q code systems that could potentially be used. The current top of the line RFID tags which allow for security plus tracking information retail about $1 (think the chip in a passport). VeChain will have RFID and NFC tags that will retail manufactures cents on the dollar but will do a better job then the ones in our passports because they communicate and update the blockchain instantaneously. 

It would literally raise the cost of a box of bullets by pennies.

My vision is the gun manufactures add these chips not to the bullets per say but the guns themselves. When a gun moves into a 'zone' that has been isolated geographically as a ""no gun zone"" (government buildings, schools, movie theaters, etc.) this information is sent to the blockchain and an alert is immediately distributed to an app that is created to identify this information. An AI isolates the gun owner and license of the gun and either sends a warning to security/police or lets it continue on its way. Anyone allowed to have their firearm should be fine just not in places it shouldn't be.

Remember this chip would have to be small enough to fit in side a bullet, light enough to have negligible effect on the trajectory, and be able to survive both the explosion that is firing and the impact of hitting something with extremely high levels of reliability.  The cost of the chip is only part of the deal as well.  Who is picking up the tab for the Thor (assuming a vechain solution) to run the blockchain?  Who is paying the people who maintain the ownership data? Et cetera.

Getting away from the chip in bullet idea, I'm not sure what the projected range for these chips are, but the power requirements necessary to broadcast say 500 yards if we implant then in the gun itself would mean lugging around a ton of batteries and adding massive complexity and therefore unreliability into a device that you may depend on for your life (police, self defense, et cetera) in order to maybe set off an alarm to attempt to prevent the tiny amount of murders that happen in a gun free zone.  Assuming if course that the perp in question is one of the 11% that is trying to kill someone with a legally purchased gun, and isn't just using one of the billions of guns without a chip in it.  Standing up some massive Orwellian AI monitoring system doesn't really seem like a great idea either.  We already have enough of that going on.

For companies that are in line with VeChain's vision, the end goal is not just to save a bit of money on product tracking, traceability or anti-counterfeiting ; they can easily do this now with more centralized, traditional solutions. Rather, the value created by public blockchain is multidimensional. To keep things simple - even if abstract - these companies will mostly benefit from the TRUST that public blockchain tech offers. 

You cannot put a price tag on this type of trust, which has been lacking for decades. To my knowledge, few researchers and industry analysts have been able to quantify the loss of value involved in having to make up for missing trust in b2b, as well b2c. It's just very difficult.

As the Ecosystem grows and the benefits of using VeChain becomes more apparent, such as GPS tracking of your goods, supply chain tracking or proprietary inventory management dashboard system, this reduces costs and allows for better allocation of resources to increase efficiency.

I personally want VeChainThor team to work on proof reading their English/western marketing materials before rushing to releasing it. They’re already very professional compared to other crypto projects, I just want to see that corporate/enterprise level professionalism.

1. Sunny knew releasing Thor without enterprise use would plummet the price giving new enterprises/small business a way to buy VET for cheap.

But that would mean VeChain Foundation and Oxford University estimations were really off, and they should have done a 1:1000 or even 1:10,000 split for the purpose of keeping whole number transaction fees. My point is, I don't think it's wise to hodl VTHO long term, because the whole purpose of designing a twin-token system was for VET to appreciate without gas fees appreciating. If everyone is holding VTHO without spending it, all VeChain has to do is increase the generation rate, which will decrease its value.

We already know that the price of VTHOR will be kept stable. Vechain has good tools to regulate the VTHOR-price. Regulation of the VET-price is much more difficult for Vechain.

And now a theory: to get mass adoption of Vechain and a high marketshare in a short time, Vechain offers a large discount on the VET-token price for the early adopters, so the publicity of those contracts generate even more attraction to the market. 
The discount is paid from the tokens Vechain own itself. This can't last forever ....

Because mass adoption and a high marketshare is the goal (and will probably be achieved), a low price for the VET-token is 'a must' from a psychological and financial perspective. That's why they need the tokensplit. This prevents Vechain to give further large discounts (paid by themselves) to convince industries and compagnies to choose for their product.

3806,I'm personally not well known with any particular laws. So sadly the question remains rather broad in it's scope. In the discussion above yours we talk about comparing dividends with Thor. The law states that dividend can only be paid from profits. I can't imagine Vechain earning enough money to pay out all Thor. So I doubt they will pay it out of their own pockets. I don't understand where the money comes from that you will get after selling Thor. ,18-02-21-19-02,2,10,BirdsTalkingDrama,7z3z42

Vechain let's investors generate Thor. Which is worth money. And will be exchanged for Fiat, but Vechain is not the one that provides the money for which you sell Thor right? That will be the banks?

3813,"If companies want to use the Thor network, they can’t rock up to Vechain and pay for it. They will need to get the tokens required from the free market. Vechain is a foundation and in that sense it’s non-profit. Of course the people involved make money, both from the value of their VEN and the Thor they generate, but the foundation does not. So we shouldn’t consider Thor a currency, nor a dividend, but rather it’s a right to use the network, and only a limited number of these rights are available, which gives it value.

For example; I have the coolest bicycle in my neighborhood and all the other kids want to use it. But only one can use it at a time, so I use my dad’s pokerchips and sell them to my friends. Every chip means you can ride my bike for an hour. I didn’t print any money nor paid myself dividends, the money comes from kids wanting to ride my bike.",18-02-21-19-02,12,9,DirtyNoobyEUW,7z3z42

3817,"Necroing this. But traveling and just sifting through things.. The foundation IS paying for the Thor. When a company uses the network, they pay Thor which has a fiat value. 70% of all Thor used is then destroyed. That's money the foundation is ""paying"" so more Thor can be created. The remaining 30% of Thor is paid to the 101 main nodes. The foundation doesn't benefit from thor itself, except for what their VET holdings generate.",18-02-21-19-02,1,63,ncory32,7z3z42

3819,"Imagine it like owning a portion of a lumber factory. The factory, which we own 1% of, creates lumber, and that lumber is given to each owner depending on their stake. 1000 lumber gets created a day, and because I own 1% I get 10 pieces of lumber.

You can then sell that lumber to people who need it, or you can use it yourself to build something.

Investors will sell their lumber, or stockpile it in hopes that it will be worth more in the future. Construction companies will just use their allotment of lumber, and buy more if they need it. Both entities could sell their share of the lumber factory if they wanted, or hold on to it.

So, the lumber factory is VeChain tokens, the lumber itself is Thor Power. Investors are us, and construction companies are anyone that actually wants to use the blockchain for supply chain management or any of the other capabilities it will provide. ",18-02-21-19-02,2,38,wowDarklord,7z3z42

Vechain doesnt even sell thor. The argument that your friend makes isnt valid. Why would free market law force anyone to provide an unlimited supply to a single person?

Use a PC not a phone.  Make sure you have a printer and a usb barcode reader, $35 from Amazon.

3. Put your same address into the qr generator, copy the QR code pic, and paste into word.

Verify the address you just scanned into notepad matches the plain txt address on paper.  Bingo, you know how to make paper wallets now.

To approximate the SP500, I own every crypto currency in coinmarketcap top 400 that is for sale on Binance or Bittrex exchanges, over 200 different brand coins.  BTC mktcap is $110B, VE is $622M,  and XEL and AMP mktcap is $7.5 million which is a 14,500:1 ratio.  For instance if I have $10,000 in BTC, an sp500 style plan would be $62 in VE and 70 cents in XEL and AMP.  I like owning smaller coins because I like to learn about them and I don't like paying a $5 withdrawal fee on $0.70 of coin so bump my ratio on bottom coins a little.",18-08-17-10-35,1,868,RayMetz100,97xrwu

At some point many that were in top 100 become number 200 or 300 by themselves.  So going lower gets easier since I already own most of them.  Right now I feel lucky if I find a top 300 or 400 coin I don't own.(binance+Bitterex only) and it's easy to buy 1-2 coins when they do appear.  Someday I can see myself going down to number 500 if I have the interest.

Maybe 50 of the coins I own are already below #500 and are a waste of time to even look up.  In some cases I bought for $20 and they are now worth 20 cents or delisted.  I change my plan and ratios every month depending how I feel at the time.  Since the Jan crash, I've been trying to keep the #100 coin at $20 and my BTC the same, then I have a curve between them.  I use x2 as my bands.  So #100 mkt capx2, x4, x8, etc, all the way to BTC, which is about 12 bands.

But I do not agree that it is a separate matter.  We received their financial report: it discussed where the VET has gone, and how much.  But what is the end goal in how the company will sustain?  The ICO funds received will run out, and people invested in the ICO probably assuming sustainability beyond.  How can we be sure they aren't going bankrupt?  In addition, the best use of VET is illustrating the value of VET in this ecosystem.  What is the point of VET if the Foundation can't cut a profit margin?  The best use of VET will obviously not be falling under, and ICO investors will be burned.  Surely there is overlap there.  There is no better way to strengthen the value of the VET token that clearly show that the VeChain ecosystem is making money off it.

This point of view makes no sense to me. Vechain has no obligation to give what he's asking for but saying he should not bother to ask for it at all serves no purpose. He's not asking for regulations. He's asking for transparency. The best way to avoid regulations is for companies to be transparent to begin with. Requiring investors to speculate and having large amounts of people losing money because of a lack of transparency is the cause of regulations, not investors who aren't happy with the ""inches"" that they're given. I'm sure Vechain won't provide the level of transparency we would like but questions like these need to be asked. Not sure why you would defend the opposite.  ",18-04-04-11-42,1,211,chupo99,89l2x3

4167,Spacex might be private but I guarantee their investors are getting plenty of transparency. If anything they're more likely to fulfill a one off request than a public company since they have fewer investors and therefor each investor is worth more to them and can affect their ability to raise money in the future. But that's the wrong line of thinking anyway. If asking for something other than your own imagination and public releases to decide what the business fundamentals look like is seen as a one off requests then that probably means investors need better transparency. ,18-04-04-11-42,1,211,chupo99,89l2x3
4168,"Good point, but perhaps because SpaceX is hemorrhaging money.  On the flip-side Koch Industries (much more successful), while not releasing to the public, releases information to Moody's Standard and Poor which provides the company with a credit rating.  Investors don't know the exact numbers, but the strong rating Moody's give them inspires confidence.  It probably depends on the company, case by case basis.  Semantics for this part imo.

Reddit is a forum.  This subreddit is focused on VeChain, hence, a forum to discuss VeChain.

4176,"I think you're misunderstanding the requirement for financial disclosures. Very few public companies would disclose financials if they were not required to by SEC reporting rules. To the point where private companies disclose financials to ratings agencies, VeChain is not rated, nor would it have any real reason to be rated in the near future (ratings are for credit lenders ONLY). And again, you are not an equity or a debt investor in VeChain and you have no right to see this type of information. 


Of course, you can ask. However, if your argument for ""having the right"" is an Enron situation, then that doesn't make sense either because they were fully audited and comforted by Arthur Andersen, which was a firm at the level or above PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Big 5 accounting firms. For financial crisis situations, the rating agencies were corrupt and gave stellar credit ratings to financial products and companies who dealt with such products that were inaccurate. In this type of situation, you could get your report and still have no idea that VeChain would go bust (not that non-profits can really go ""bust""). 


The current financial reporting paradigm for sizable public companies is only a decade old, and expecting it for a crypto company, which is a non-profit no less, is a pretty silly ask. ",18-04-04-11-42,1,1,GarzyWarzy,89l2x3

Care to quote when I said this ever in this thread, or even in my post history?  Please reference other mentions in this thread here (before your response) where I clearly state I own an (irrelevant) amount of tokens and not shares.

It's ironic in all these responses everyone gives here claiming I ""have no right"", or refuting my argument for ""having the right"" when I never originally have stated I *had a right to know*.  You quoted me, when I never actually said that quote.  So, no I am not misunderstanding what the requirements are: I never said I ""deserved to know"".  Neither is my argument is to avoid an Enron situation: this is a clear strawman you have created to cherrypick a line as to why I am a more conservative investor in general.  I have repeated, several times, the information here would be to illustrate the long-term viability of the Foundation, therefore the VeChain ecosystem, and thereby the VET tokens.  Which you never directly addressed: what happened with Enron & the financial crisis does not hit the nail on the head but rather clips the side and calls bullseye (also, non-profits can go ""bust"", uhhh https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/04/29/nonprofit-corporation-navigating-through-bankruptcy/).

I do not agree concerning how it is a ""silly ask"" to question how VeChain will afford to continue operations post ICO funds, but rather the most important ask one should make for any company.  Companies are worthless without money.  It's irrelevant whether it's a non-profit vs. for-profit.  It's irrelevant if it's a crypto company or ""normal"" company.  It's irrelevant how old the financial reporting paradigm is (bitcoin has been around a decade ya know?  It's new too).  It's a company, and it has expenses.  And companies can only exist if they can answer the age-old capitalist question on how they can make money.",18-04-04-11-42,3,48,jbasket444,89l2x3

4181,"Not everything is a personal attack or question for you. You are actually not that important. See the difference -- that was more personal, since you are being a child. 


The RIGHT TO SEE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in the world of finance, is for EQUITY and DEBT investors. 

Company wants to raise debt --> need credit ratings to reach wider institutional audience --> company publishes financials to agencies and institutions for diligence purposes

Company wants to raise capital through sale of equity --> need to raise awareness and interest in go-forward growth profile --> company publishes financials to retail and institutional investors for diligence purposes


You never stated that you had the right but you are sure are insinuating it, among other things. I am not speaking about YOUR right, but the right in general. There is no other reason. Disclosure is entirely regulation- and investor-based. NO. OTHER. REASON. You have a fundamental underappreciation of this fact. In this case, there are no regulations, and the investor is YOU, who decided to invest via finger-in-the-air methods because you believed in the short- or long-term appreciation of what you were buying. Here's the irony: you already bought it, and now you are requesting diligence materials under the guise of ""hey we should all knew more about the inner workings of the company"" and ""oh the token value would appreciate more if there was even more info"". 


So the response to you with relation to what you asked, ""When can we expect them to publish this information? Have they made mention of this before? One of the reasons I have invested in VeChain is because of the way they carry themselves: business focused, no-nonsense, looking at the big picture. But as investors, we should demand to know how exactly they will meet the bottom line"" is: 


1. Never unless regulators demand it (which is not now) or they feel really really nice (which has happened before). Maybe they're even waiting for the more mature VeChain entity to take shape before throwing out info --
 companies that IPO are given years or a certain market cap before they are required to fully disclose their operations in greater detail.
2. No (past their financial reports which is exceedingly nice of them), and 
3. You know exactly how you they plan to meet the bottom line (ETH from ICO, VET in reserve, THOR generation from VET in reserve, and any one-time or recurring fees from blockchain-related consulting). 


On other notes, you are just very clearly misunderstanding my point on Enron and the financial crisis re using reports as a method to ""be cautious about investment"". I misspoke on NFP bankruptcy, meaning to say VeChain specifically since they are highly unlikely to raise any meaningful amount of debt. In general, you are all over the place with the reasons that this information should be released in the first place, all of which are debatable. And if you aren't aware that you type like you're entitled to something, well, there is a reason everyone thinks that you think you are entitled to something.",18-04-04-11-42,0,1,GarzyWarzy,89l2x3

- Never mentioned things being a personal attack??? (Although I agree, I'm not important to VeChain really.  I'm a Joe.  C'est la vie.)  But let's stay out of that arena.

- Nobody is disagreeing with you on why financial statements are released.  Again, I never said we VET holders have a right to this information.  I really don't know how else to get that across.  To say I insinuated that is a strong conclusion to make.  I will repeat again about the importance of this information & the effect it can have: my strong stance on that does not correlate to a entitlement however.

- I'm going to assume you haven't read my post history, but I got into VeChain in 2017.  Spare me with the ""finger-in-the-air"" methods.  We can't ask questions about what we invested in even months later?

- Thanks for the answers, those three points are the only points that actually addressed the questions in this whole thread.  Perhaps this is why I am ""all over the place"" then.

- I wasn't trying to correlate using reports... this is semantics.  I'm not going to explain my (probably dumb crap) I do with investments.

- Understood on the NFP bankruptcy.  These reasons, as you mentioned, clearly are debatable, hence the reaction to this thread and my shit posting.

- It's probably because of the words ""demand"" and ""expect"" when talking about we VET holders, but surely that wouldn't correlate to ""me me me I want want want"", or so I thought.  I'm not going to edit my OP.",18-04-04-11-42,1,48,jbasket444,89l2x3

Make a copy cat site that's extremely realistic (biṇaṇce)

Even ask for 2FA on login so you can login to the real site with their details

Re-direct the user after fake login back to real binance login page so they don't get suspicious, just weird they have to login again

Use the stolen login details to create API keys on these accounts in the background on the real binance

Accumulate cheap VIA over a period of time, over multiple unverified (anonymous) accounts

Place that VIA up for sale at 10x+ the current price on these accounts

Monitor amount of money in all compromised accounts
Once amounnt gets > ALL sell orders of VIA in binance PLUS some targetted profit amount, bring plan to fruition:

Use API keys from everyone earlier to market sell all their holdings into bitcoin

Use bitcoin to market buy VIA

Now all your anonymous accounts you created have ~2 BTC in each

Buy monero(?) on all these accounts

Send it all to multiple different monero addresses you own (perhaps immediately to other exchanges so you can sell for bitcoin/fiat)

Sell everything for fiat

This site gained access to a lot of people's actual binance account login info. Then, with the obtained login info, the hacker logged in and activated their private api on binance. Then they lay in wait collecting other api keys.

Check your binance account and look to see if you have an api created. The default is to NOT have one activated.

I'm really sorry and I hope you're able to get your funds back. I hear that binance users have been reimbursed in Bitcoin, and currently bitcoin has dropped less than most alts.

CCK has started using the Walton colors with certain words he uses. He does so in that section. Pretty sure a portion of WTC call themselves the Knights of Walton.  IMO, “Chevalier” and “shield” couldn’t point to anything else.

I’m personally neutral (I wish endless wealth to everyone), but CCK seems not to like them. “Glass” suggests to me that he believes their organization is one that is built of promised that are easily shattered. Like the foolish builders in the Bible (CCK has been using religious references recently, too) who built their house on sand, as opposed to the rock.

Could CCK have predicted WaltonChain’s recent twitter snafu? Doubtful. Unlikely. Is he implying that there are other issues that are not yet apparent? Maybe. Is CCK like a rabid sports fan who loves only Team VeChain? Hell yeah!",18-03-02-04-11,1,1,mashuupicchu,816ugt

4610,"what is the age of your grandkids?

i feel their age heavily influence how i feel about the situation, you are about to give financial advice and give them an headstart.

i personally think, no matter the age, donating crypto is fine. depending on their age naturally involve the parents. i'd also skip the advice to invest themself if their age is a bit younger.

i assume since you want to advice them to invest they are near 20, above 20? be carefull how you word your advice, it is their own responsibility to invest and you can only help them, make it clear it is their own money and their own responsibility. remember you are setting them up for losses, trading creates winners and losers and very few start winning at the start of the game.

if you decide to donate them VET or any other coin, remember you give them money, it is up to them how to use it. if they decide to spend it foolishly, then that is their mistake. setting preconditions for the donation is, imo, wise. demanding a hold for 3 years sound like a good idea. personally i would go for a partial lock up, lets say at least 80% has to stay locked up. this way you allow them to make mistakes while storing enough value for later. you could achieve this by holding 800 VET yourself in a seperate wallet, while you donate 4*50 VET for them to use. numbers are variable, you could even start with 10 VET just to get the trading game started. personally i think the smaller the better, again, it all depends on age, how the person is, etc.

if you really wish to teach them how to trade, i believe the foundation is the most important aspect of any form of teaching.  
for trading:    
strategy, this includes planning,  
patience

I'm not so sure about TRON myself, also since my wife (Chinese) listened and watched a video by Justin Sun (in Mandarin) and instantly didn't like him for various reasons. She thinks he was/is a bit snobby and self-sufficient. Usually, she's ALWAYS right about a person, including foreigners from different countries (other than China). Strange enough I'm not so sure. This chap of 27/28 years old has quite an impressive record and the fact that he graduated at the highest possible strict entrance demands of the private Hupan Uni, set up by Jack Ma of Alibaba (3 years of education) says something about him (he was privately picked by Jack Ma) whilst building several businesses since he was even younger is truly amazing. He was also mentioned in Forbes under-30, In Davos/Switzerland and made it to the cover of Asia Weekly. That's quite impressive. I like young people who set their goals so high. That some find his ""product"" in the entertainment business weak is not so strange since I agree with that and also ask myself what content TRON's product stand for. But he surely must have asked Jack Ma how, what, where, how-to-do etc etc. On the other hand I think that TRON's product is more deep and wide than we might anticipate within the entertainment and other design industries. That TRON is valued at some $2.7Billion and in the top 15 says something also. That he showed himself as being self-sufficient can be forgiven at his age. 
Nevertheless all this, we decided to sell half of our TRON investment and we'll see from here what to do: HODL or sell before June 21, 2018 when TRON joins the MainNet.

He invested in small ICO's with a price of 0,00002 or something like that which of course exploded in November '17 to January '18 after which most of his profits went downhill when the market collapsed in Jan '18.

Holding the wallets for them: although that's basically a very good idea, they would not learn much about trading and studying about cryptos and the possibilities, winning and losing. My initial idea was to encourage them via the donation but NOT sell the VET's yet for 3 years or so but invest little by little themselves so that they start considering the initial Donation as their ""own"" money when it grows with their own cash. The eldest kid is a dyslectic lad but is trading crypto's already since a longer period and has a special ""nose"" for crypto ICO's.

VeChain the product was a private blockchain built under the wing of BitSE alongside other blockchain solutions such as QTUM. After a falling out, everyone dispersed from BitSE, the details of the fall out likely will never be public as due to the legal nature of it. That is why VeChain put the statement out that they did.

This is a key difference between VeChainThor and other public blockchain protocols. Built in governance tools. (VeVID, VeVOT, VeSCC). Anyone can develop, but only the vetted projects will be backed.

4844,"Ok, here are my opinions seeing as this has struck a chord.  I retain my belief that OP fuds because I see not one positive post in his/her entire history- despite spending a lot of time on VeChain sub- but who knows.

Is it possible AN’s could collude to alter data on the blockchain?  Yes.

Do I trust that reputational damage would always be enough to prevent an entity from attempting make a profit?  No.

Can I make any objective assessment of the ‘trustworthiness’ of the selected AN’s before their identities have been announced?  No.

Does this concern me at this point in time?  No.

I have made an investment, to which I understand there are risks attached.  DNV GL, PWC and the Chinese government have openly advertised their involvement with & support for VeChain.  I know that these entities will have far greater knowledge, insight and understanding than me. For this reason, at this point in time, while AN’s remain unknown, the risk/reward ratio remains attractive by my appetite.

OP talks about trusting corporations.  Check out https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/https-medium-com-vechainofficial-authority-masternodes-4c1233c6f18e.  Not all authority nodes will be corporations.  They will include enterprise users, blockchain development teams, business development ambassadors, community contributors and academic research partners.
Different node types will have different motivations, ethics, values etc.  For now, let’s assume that there will be a reasonable distribution across these node types and that holders are selected wisely and have decent reputations.  I cannot conceive a reasonable scenario where 51% of these nodes, would collude to alter/fake a piece of data on the blockchain.  Altering a given piece of data might benefit a particular selection of corporations- but would be unlikely to benefit a university, member of a blockchain development team, or community member in the same way.  Is it possible that 25% of the nodes could attempt to pay off the remaining 26% in order to pull something like this off?  I suppose so- but this would be highly risky as someone would probably blow the whistle.  What piece of data likely to be held on the blockchain would really be this valuable?  If there is one, I would simply suggest not putting it on the blockchain!

If it turns out that 101 nodes do not provide sufficient protection, I imagine it would not be too difficult to simply increase to 201 nodes- thereby doubling the number of entities that would need to collude.

And aside from all this, I am simply an investor.  I just need to be satisfied that my investment will eventually rise in value.  For as long as I am seeing evidence that enterprises are trusting and buying into VeChain, I know that this will translate to transactions and in turn an increase in the value of VTHO & VET.  I am seeing plenty of evidence of this, so I am very happy.

I’ve had a discussion about this with a fellow community member after the post of the drug and vaccine traceability programm. 
In it’s current state the benefit of blockchain is really in writing data gathered by sensors and other IOT devices onto the blockchain, and this data cannot be tampered with once written on the blockchain, making it trustless.
However this doesn’t say anything about the quality of the data....A sensor along the supplychain that measured the temperature of a container filled with Class A Argentinian Rumpsteakes could have written inaccurate data onto the blockchain, intentionally because it was told to do so or unintentionally because of a mechanical defect.

4851,"I believe most of Vechain’s solutions are meant for enterprises to increase their profitability, efficiency, cut costs, etc. So the use of the word “We” isn’t really relavant except for the solutions meant to protect consumers directly. You sort of acknowledge this in your edit, and it’s true, the people being given defective vaccines fall into the “we” that will have to trust the corporations. 

This doesnt make it as reliant on trust as it is now though, vechains solution while not entirely trustless is signifcantly better than how situations are now. Example:

Company A is a vaccine producer and distributor in China. As it stands now, they can distribute defective/ expired vaccines due to carelessness, let kids die, and then go back into their databases to protect themselves however they can. Dishonest people, dishonest data.

You can assume vechain’s solution here will make it much harder for the vaccine producer to go back and cover their tracks. Even if they could do this with the majority of authority node holders in collusion, it’d be much harder to do in comparison to leaving it all in the hands of that one pharma company. 

When choosing between 100% reliant on trust, pretty trustless, and 100% trustless, i’d say most wouldnt mind ‘pretty trustless’. Improvements are improvements.

Let's be absurdly generous and assume there's a 90% chance of any given node being willing to collude.  Let's also assume a node will either be willing to collude, or will report collusion to the foundation - it doesn't make sense that a node who doesn't want to collude would allow the others to do so, it defeats the purpose of them using the blockchain.

This means that to successfully collude, you need to get 51 consecutive ""yes"" responses.  .9^51 = .004638, or 0.4638% chance of success.  Because if one node says no and reports it to VeChain, it completely falls apart.

Change the odds of a yes to 50% and the chances of success become ridiculously small.  

You can make arguments about the assumptions, but I think the general point about how difficult it would be to get 51 nodes to collude to alter data stands.

4876,"The network is decentralized in the sense that you cannot tell which node will produce a block. This, in theory, allows for much sharper scaling which is what VeChain wants to achieve for enterprise adoption. The ledger is distributed, the work on the ledger is divided, but not distributed. So each Node will have to confirm transaction of ALL other parties and will not know when it will step in to confirm transaction, this completely eradicates opportunity for fraud, since quite literally everyone on the network will be able to detect it instantly, and you have no way of accurately manipulating transactions without controlling the ENTIRE network of blockproducers. the consensus is achieved after the block production, but this just means that each node is up to date.

You could imagine it as a single database that randomly lets some server access it and confirm all data that passes through for a short amount of time, until another server takes over. Its very fast, because theres no need to reach consensus because all you do is send updates, but not distributed.

In other words: It seems to be a single point of failure to me, however in such a way that it can achieve VeChains Goals. Scalability and Verification.

If VeChain is as successful as it appears it will be, an X-node will have a high value attached to it, as with any scarce commodity.

Those selling are being a bit short sighted and the buyers have the reverse mentality - they see the long term value.

Do you notice the conflict in what you are expecting of Vechain. You want them to reward early supporters but also prefer that those early supporters lose their x. 

Besides that, they are cheap because like you some sellers don't understand the value of it yet. Youre thinking about your own VTHO generation and how that would increase if nodes died. But you should think about the increase of VTHO for the buyers and base your price on that. Itll take some time and the market maturing before ppl can see it's value.

I have a different perspective. People are pricing X-nodes in dollar terms and not VET terms. So, if you sell at the very bottom, you maybe will get 3 million VET.

5076,"“The following instructions” refer to the binding process. The binding process is same for all VECHAIN MAIN NET wallets. 

There are two blockchains Ethereum (where ERC20 Ven is) and Vechain Main Net (where VET is, ignore the fact that MEW is saying VET, it’s actually ERC20 VEN). The binding process links the Xnode on Ethereum to a wallet on Vechain main net making the Main Net Wallet an Xnode. You need one ERC20 wallet with VEN and one VET wallet on Vechain Main Net to bind together. 

Right now you have ERC20 Ven on your Ledger. You want the Ledger to make a Vechain Main Net Wallet with VET. Then once you make the VET wallet on the Vechain Main Net you can follow the same binding process as everyone. So once the Ledger app comes out you can bind directly to the Ledger using observe. As of now Ledger hasn’t released an app. If they don’t release one then by Aug 10 you have to bind your Xnode using Vechain Mobile Wallet and Vechain has stated it can be moved to Ledger later.

Binance: Binance creates a unique address for each user's deposits. Every so often, Binance housecleans and sends everything in that user's deposit address to the main Binance VET wallet, but keeps a note in their database that that amount is owned by the user. This note is what you see when you check your balance. When you withdraw, they send you money from the main Binance VET wallet.

If you have 50k in the binance deposit address associated with your account at 4:00PM UTC, then you get the reward (which will show up in your Binance account).

You’re also confusing increasing supply with increasing owners equity.  They are not the same in this case.  This is essentially a stock split, not looking for more money.

5090,"You are confusing the situation. It absolutely WILL be 52B or higher circulating supply ""right out of the gate."" What you are referring to in your first paragraph example is an increase in the circulating supply out of a set maximum supply - for example the 275M to 525M you mentioned out of the total maximum supply of 873M. In that situation, additional tokens have been made available to the public out of the pre-existing total. Market cap increases while your individual holdings stay the same. That situation typically has implications on the total value of your individual holdings because they now constitute a lower portion of the total available supply. If investors deem that the total worth of the company has not changed in value, then the dollar value of each individual token MUST decrease. Your holdings will be harmed by this.

However, that is not what VeChain is doing!

What VeChain is doing with the conversion to VET is a token split (similar to a stock split in traditional stock market trading). They are splitting each VET token, including the ones you own, by 100, so even though the circulating supply multiplies 100x, so do your holdings, therefore nothing is personally gained or lost for you.

The value of each of your individual tokens will likely decrease from $4.50 to $0.045, but the total value of all of your tokens will stay the same.

Example at the split assuming you have 10,000 tokens currently.

Old supply = 10,000 tokens * $4.50 = $45,000 total worth of your VEN

New supply = 1,000,000 tokens * $0.045 = $45,000 total worth of your VET

It creates no difference in value to your personal holdings.

REAL Fortune 500/1000 companies have agreed to PARTNER and USE Vechain, VTHO and its blockchain.

5332,"I agree with most of what you said, but I'll add a couple things you left out:

1) ETH value is largely speculative. Who knows if it is severely overvalued right now? Once the numbers are out for VET transactions, costs, usage we will have a much better idea what VET is fundamentally worth. Sure, future growth would be factored in, but much of the speculation on VET price will be removed.

2) Other major platforms (including the ones we hate) should eat into ETH's market share once they prove themselves, VET included. 

With that said, I still think VET is the much better investment given the current market caps with everything we have going for us.",18-05-18-02-10,24,255,rmj3,8k5fyt
5333,"I dig your train of thought. I also dig speculating on valuations, even if we don’t have all the information to be exacting. The “what could be” of VeChain is why we are all here, valuation is important and with that naturally comes some price talk. 

I will repost one of my comments here:

ETH chart trend

March 15 2017 - 2.7B market cap
June 16 2017 - 34.3B market cap
Dec 19 2017 - 73.4B market cap
26.8x ish in 9 months

VeChain chart trend
May 4 2018 - 2.7B market cap

A 26.8x increase would be $143 per VeChain token by February 2019. 

So what is a moderate valuation? It’s a subjective question. I think VeChain will have a more robust platform and will be used more. So if I factor in “crypto being crypto”, “the markets suck right now”, “we are tied to BTC”, “institutional money will short the market”, and all the other common themes I read, I want my expectations to be deliberately low/realistic/conservative. 

I say for 2018, could I reasonably expect a similar bull run for VeChain? No. But given this technology is here to stay, who is invested, how VeChain is actively working with enterprises, I like to think 2018 *may* reflect 25% of the bull run Ethereum had. Why? That’s my idea of being conservative given its major potential. Someone can expect way more, someone can expect way less. 

And that would put us at $35.75 per VET. It’s not a prediction, it’s just something that seems reasonable to me, given VeChain seems to be leading in the use case and application department. So I’m right there with you.

Take SAP for example, they serve 55,000 customers world-wide. 55,000. A truly insane amount customers using their supply chain management solutions. Their revenue in 2016 was ""only"" $26B with total equity standing at $30B. As much as I want to see Vechain hit $50, $75, $100 I just don't see this happening, at least in the short term. At the current SAP valuation, Vechain would be right at $50. I believe Vechain will rise to challenge established behemoth's like SAP but this is not going to happen overnight (~1 year). 

Of course, this market is crazy any anything can happen. Vechain could rise to $100 based off of overall market speculation similar to what happened in the dot com bubble then fall back down to earth.

Currently, I tend to look at ETH/VEN as a similar comparison to Android and iOS.

Personally, that is one of the reasons I like VEN so much because I think they've got a great vision for who they're trying to help.

Furthermore, both projects can coexist easily if the Google/Apple comparison is any indicator. My hope is that those two separate from the pack and render many of the smaller (redundant) crypto projects obsolete.

What they are (barely) describing here is quite a bit more ambitious than just forking Ethereum.

Claiming 70% compatibility with web3 implies that they have implemented something that is very close to the Ethereum protocol spec ostensibly from scratch? This seems a bit off TBH but I’m still pretty convinced that their business acumen is sound. Really interested to see this code if/when it’s released.

5549,"tl;dr if nodes start generating more THOR then it's worth buying more VET because you get more passive income. 

Cheap for world-wide use. 

If everyone just bought THOR OTC for a fiat price then how much world-wide money would come in?

Say 500,000 businesses of all sizes use THOR world-wide. 

Say on average a business needs 2,000 THOR a year.

500,000 businesses * 2000 THOR = 1,000,000,000 THOR needed.

1 VET will generate 0.15330 THOR a year

Total supply 867,162,634 VET

132,936,031 THOR generated a year right now if there were none for sale and everyone generated THOR.

Lets say 100,000,000 THOR generated a year. 

And demand calls for 1,000,000,000 THOR a year.

So you increase supply 10x to meet the demand. 

Price goes down 10x

But now you generate 10x more THOR.

So if you are a 6000 X node you might be generating 1,000 THOR a year at first. Hold long enough and you could end up generating 10,000 THOR a year. If THOR is $1 then you are making $10,000 a year.

So basically we're just hoping for THOR demand to skyrocket so we can generate like 10x more THOR and if price is around 50 cents to a $1 then that would be sweet for those who generating a good sum of THOR.",18-03-15-13-51,3,47,idunnopotato,84jaxg

I believe you will transfer this to the intermediary address, and VeChain will send them to your VET wallet, or you can send it to an exchange (my preference) to handle the swap, and then transfer from exchange directly to VET wallet.",18-07-16-16-09,5,857,handspurs,8z8irk
5742,"May I just say, this topic has been done to death. Of course I will lend my knowledge, but there is plenty of information out there regarding this. 

The combination of your current address and your newly, ledger created address will give you a unique intermediary address. You send 0.01 VET To this address to confirm your ownership of said address, and bind your node to this new adddress. 

Then, when binding ends after 10 days, you send the rest of your tokens and they will be credited to your new VeChain wallet. ",18-07-16-16-09,2,1660,Crypto-knowdeway,8z8irk

No one has a ledger address at this time as ledger is not yet ready. I have created vechain mobile wallet address and an intermediary-address in the mobile wallet and have send 0.01 VEN to it and completed the Node binding process. I intent to convert my tokens via binance but I do not want to keep my x node on mobile wallet but instead I want to keep it on ledger nano S.

WAIT FOR LEDGER APP

- create VeChain address on ledger app
- generate intermediary address from old and new addresses using the wallet
- bind x-node to new address via transfer of 0.01 VET
-await confirmation 
-wait for node binding period to end (10 days after ledger support announced)
-send rest of tokens to intermediary for the linked, VeChain wallet to be populated by new VET tokens. 


If you have already bound your x-node on the wallet app, you will have to complete it via the wallet app.

The good news is, with the release of VeVid, you’ll be able to transfer your x-node to a ledger address eventually, although in how long, mo body currently knows.",18-07-16-16-09,2,1660,Crypto-knowdeway,8z8irk

Should I wait for ledger and get that address and do the node binding to ledger address and abandon the created binded node. All it takes is 0.01 VEN. ",18-07-16-16-09,1,979,WorldSpark,8z8irk
5746,"Honestly not even sure if that’s possible. You’ve created an address and already linked it to another. I think you’re going to have to see through the process now.

If you’re concerned with security for now, what I would suggest is sending across the rest of your VET when the swap becomes available, setting up your node on your phone via the wallet app (ENSURE YOU CORRECTLY WRITE DOWN THE SEED WORDS GIVEN TO YOU AT WALLET SET-UP - make copies, physical, digital, disperse copies at mum and dad’s to make sure you don’t lose them  (although never store online) - and then delete the wallet app off your phone entirely (if sufficiently paranoid). Your address will still exist but there will be no interface for it on your phone. This can then be imported again when you reinstall the app using the Seed words given to you at the very start, hence why they are so vital. They are your only back up.

Then, once VeVid comes out, You can transfer ownership of one xnode address to a ledger address. 

But do remember, although not preferable for some, the mobile wallet is fairly safe. Multiple passwords, even fingerprint locks. Just stay off dodgy sites, delete unnecessary apps, if possible, do a fresh wipe of your entire phone for maximum security (for the more paranoid).

What if I use another phone to create another mobile wallet and bind that to ledger address?
Also what if the mew address does not have enough coins for x node but had it when snapshot was taken? Will x node status still remain?

This is where consumers come in, I believe. When you, as a consumer, have the choice between something that is verified through the blockchain and something that is not, you might be more inclined to go for the one that is verified.

>My best guess is they will just continue providing bullshit information. Vechain can make that bullshit immutable, but there is nothing they can do to verify the truthfulness of the information.

With IoT and sensors (e.g. temperature sensors that automatically upload this information to the blockchain), it is impossible to tamper with the information that is uploaded to the blockchain. Only when information has to be manually uploaded is there a chance that there will be 'bullshit' input.

When it ships the truck could have a gps sensor that has an encrypted key as well. You would be able to verify that the lumber came from where they said it did with the combination of gps and company signatures. Or at the very least you could find the source of the problem. 

The fair trade label that you currently trust means nothing unless you could track that the item really came from where the stickers said it did. Even if you did track it with blockchain you would always need a third party to verify the working conditions. 

I think the point in all this is to eventually pressure every step of the manufacturing process on blockchain. Suppliers that decide to join the blockchain to show they are on the up and up will be more likely to be used by companies farther down the manufacturing pipeline. That puts pressure on suppliers to join the blockchain tracking.  And the those manufacturers that don't provide supplier information will hopefully have pressure to use blockchain proven suppliers instead. Especially once there are enough blockchain tracked suppliers that there isn't a good reason to use an untracked one.

6032,"I would love if this could be addressed by VeChain to get their bearings on this issue. But from my own thought process about this I believe the prevention will be from a reputation standpoint. 

The immutability from my understanding means you can track the product from inception to the end user. From a supply chain standpoint it seems every entity through which a product passes could be considered a consumer with an interest in the verifying the authenticity of information regarding the product as they are in the chain of information and their reputation is also on the line. So “consumers” at every stage of transition would have some incentive to verify the information. 

Let’s assume though producer XYZ lies about some aspect of the product and puts it on the block chain. Assuming only the end user catches the fraud activity of the product it will lead to potentially harmed reputations of every entity in the blockchain process. The burden then shifts to each entity of the process to verify their reputation of good standing to the community. Obviously again their is potential for fraud in this process for verifying reputation but it also puts the public on notice and to carefully watch the companies in the chain thus making it harder to continue fraudulent activity without discovery. 

So while it doesn’t necessarily prevent fraud initially it makes it harder and harder to continue with fraudulence as any previous fraudulence is discovered. This seems it would work the same with worker comp and child labor as well. If you are trying to avoid products that employed child labors or unfair wages you will look at whether any entity who employs Jose methods is an entity within the chain. If it is a big enough public problem such entities in the chain will need to do something to increase consumer confidence they are not doing such unethical practices. Again this doesn’t prevent fraud from occurring initially but puts the public spotlight on the entity and if it is found out that such practices are occurring let’s consumers avoid products with such an entity in the chain.

Obviously there are some companies that will employ these practices but are too big to really avoid like Apple iPhones and other products whose product is of more value to the consumer than the value of ethical practices. However, I don’t believe the majority of companies fall within such a category. There were other points I was thinking to try and address but this is too big already.

For the Enterprise type, just as an example. It can make sense to announce you have an AN (we might see this soon) but this could also be not so smart. Think about this; let's say you want to use Vechain for anti-counterfeiting / fraud purposes. By announcing you are an AN you publicly share that you are using the Vechain solution. That is a strategic risk. If you are in this business, you don't tell the market HOW you do it.

I think there is somewhere a sweet spot in transaction price in order to please both parts (investors and enterprises) and that is why they are collaborating with Oxford University in order to research possible models.

 In my opinion what they will end up doing is decreasing the amount of VTHO per transaction... But of course that will decrease the burn rate of VTHO and eventually lead to a decrease in price.

However, I would also take issue with your assertion that $.10 is a fair price and $.01 is too low. To be clear, I am a VET holder and so I want the best possible return by generating VTHO. But, in your example, generating $150/year on a $2000 investment is a 7.5% dividend. Maybe this seems low in the lambo-moon world of cryptocurrency, but 7.5% is a pretty competitive rate in general. If VTHO is $.10, then you're getting $1,512 per year on a $2000 investment...about 75%. Again, I'm a VET holder, that would be awesome, but frankly it is way too high. Buyers would flock to VET, driving up total VTHO production which would naturally force the value of VTHO down.

I really wish he'd have been more forthcoming with details about what those incentives for holding are, though. Just vaguely alluding to ""privileges"", I took to mean that they (VEN management) knew they had to offer something for hodling but hadn't decided what it would be yet.

6609,"So I jumped straight to 24:15 ... paraphrasing:

Normal economic node holders are eligible for special reward pool will recieve a a bonus of VeThor generated from 150 million VET set aside for.

He then goes on to say:  BUT if you are a X node holder you will receive an additional reward which is a bonus on an addition 50million set aside by the foundation for.

And finally:  So if your a Strength X node holder you are eligible for the bonus as a normal node as well as an X node.

To back up your claim, in my opinion, he would need to have said ""So if you're a Thor X node, with 10k vet you are eligible for both rewards"" ... that is how I interpreted your earlier comment.

I think the entry-level node position to receive BOTH regular and X node bonuses is Strength X as indicated by Page 5 of the medium article and Kevin's own words.",18-03-18-12-41,1,997,sonicHeart,858bpc
6610,I guess we will see what happens. If this is the case then how do you choose between the VeThor x node or the normal strength node?,18-03-18-12-41,1,140,alecw042,858bpc
6611,"That is your decision as an investor/early adopter.  This very dilemma has been discussed quite a bit since the X Node program was announced.  Basically everyone holding 10,000-15,999 VEN have a decision to make: Retaining Strength Node status or become a Thor X node with 4k VEN in reserve to invest in other projects once they become available.  The medium article says X node holders will receive rewards/benefits that have yet to be announced.  Some feel that X node holders will get early access to ICOs on BlockchainX -- if that is the case, you could use that 4k extra ven (while maintaining 6k for Thor X status) to buy into an ICO.

You can also choose to remain a regular Strength Node and the reward/benefit for that status has not changed.  However, in the same interview you linked me to, Kevin Fang mentions that the ""..foundation has the right to decrease the reward pool by 25million every 6 months.""  And shortly after says that there is no plan to decrease the reward pool for X nodes.

It depends on your goals tbh.  If you are planning to hold VEN/VET for longer than 2 years, you should lock in an X node and accumulate as much ven as you can to build to Strength X status.

If you plan on unloading all of your VEN/VET over the next year or two, then you might benefit from remaining a strength node.

I'm trying to find another post about people in the 10,000-15,999 range as well.  I think its on VechainTrader though.

edit:  I think the way you 'decide' is after march 20th, once you're flagged as an X node, you would then 'exit' the X-Node pool by simply moving your VEN/VET to a different wallet.  Your wallet address would cease to be identified as an X node and regular Strength node rewards would apply.  Do your own research on this though as I'm not 100% of the procedure.",18-03-18-12-41,1,997,sonicHeart,858bpc

6685,"Your logic is a little circular. You're assuming that the price of Thor will be 0.25 the price of VeChain, which will lead to an annual return of 5% in Thor alone. But that 0.25 comes from the assumption that VeChain will give you a Thor return of 5% a year. To see what I mean, consider instead this pricing model: assume that 1 Thor = 0.5 VeChain. Under that model, an investor will receive a 10% return in Thor alone (not 5%). 

In reality, the price of VeChain should be a function of two things: the future expected value of Thor, and the risk premium investors need. If, say, investors think that Thor will remain the same price forever, and the risk premium they require is only 5%, then the price of 1 VeChain token will equal roughly 4 Thor tokens. If, however, the risk premium is 10% (or 15%, or 20%, etc.), then the price of one VeChain token will be far less than 4 Thor tokens. 

Essentially what I'm trying to say here is that the market will determine what the ratio is for Thor to VeChain is. And whatever the market determines will be optimal. As such, there is no need for the VeChain foundation to change the Thor payouts. ",18-02-14-12-41,17,3032,bentaylor84,7xej2r

Nodes and incentives help prevent sudden massive investor sell-off.  If there's no utility to a token except expecting it to increase in value in the future, you are always at higher risk for a huge investor dump. 

*But*, if the true value of the coin is the dividends it generates, which large money is willing to lock away VEN tokens to get, that creates a stable token. 

VeChain holds a large amount of VEN.  So in essence, they are paid by the holders who stabilize the value of their currency. 

If more and more people are unwilling to sell a coin, then demand for it increases, as does scarcity, driving value up.  

That's the incentive behind a masternode network like VeChain has established. 

The ""currency"" of VeChain *is* VeChain.  Because it is a true ""coin"", not a token.  

So VeChain can afford to accept payment for services in the form of Thor, because they hold VET coins, and they are incentivizing more businesses to buy and stake VET and lock it away in masternodes, thus increasing the value of the coins that VeChain holds. 

With those coins, they can trade them for fiat and use that fiat to do things like improve VeChain, higher more developers and marketers, incentivize more dApp developers, have contests, forge partnerships, etc.",18-02-14-12-41,1,538,ninemiletree,7xej2r

Also multiple people on the team that have friends that own huge business companies that will be using walton. Walton has detail info about their blockchain, will have side chains to allow public and private data. Septwolves is a fucking giant, walton isn't just doing retail, it's also RFID, NFC , QR like what VEN has. Also walton is more logistics focused , VEN is more fake goods focus. Walton will continue to design  more hardware. Also Walton's chips can mine them self. No details about VEN. VEN isn't bad but Walton is way better technology wise, and just has the same level of business partnerships. Walton's newest competition will give them even greater exposure VEN can get. PwC is marketing and auditing firm that helps other companies grow is basically a stamp that a project is legit.  Walton doesn't need that because it already has some industry leaders in their field with business connections already. The K&N partnership is the only WOW factor I see with VEN.

As far as I know, IBM's only current blockchain involvement is with XLM which is a smart contract payment protocol currently valued at like 25 cents with a circulating supply about half of XRP.

It takes months of preparation to change a business strategy. New people have to be hired. Staff has to be properly trained for new protocols. In the real world, fortune 500 companies do not switch overnight.

Do not forget how young this market really is. And Vechain is doing a tremendous job. However, some people might not think it is a bright revolutionary ‘dreamy’ future like some other coins promise.

7189,"I stumbled across your post while browsing. If you look at my post history, you will find that I am an IOTA supporter. 

I have no reason to dislike (or like for that matter) anything Vechain does. I am not invested in Vechain but not because I think it’s a scam, shitcoin or anything alike. It’s proposition simply doesn’t appeal to me. 

While you asked for an opinion, here’s an outside view, if you are interested:

The question you asked, is asked in every sub. And the answers are everywhere the same. Here‘s why. 

Every coin/token has advantages. People tend to focus on them and disregard any downsides while comparing. Hardly any coins/tokens are in the same development stage (no mainnet, no partners, no PoCs, no adoption?), making a comparison harder - and easier the same time. 

Nano focuses on TPS but doesn’t have any adoption. ADA followers compare the notion of (better?) smart contracts with ETH but doesn’t even have a mainnet (?). BTC compares security models and disregards any argument about TPS by pointing to the not-yet implemented lightning. Tron followers believe in .. a million TPS (I think). 

As an IOTA proponent, I for example focus on fees, TPS and the amount of partners/PoCs. Fees are easily compared and are looking good for IOtA. In terms of „unlimited scalability“ (laws of physics still apply) I am aware that IOTA isn’t quiet there yet, but nevertheless compare the proposition of „unlimited“ to any other coin. That’s what i signed up for, right? So why wouldn’t I? In terms of partners/PoCs, IOTA already acquired official partners in the range of $1.5 trillion USD revenue, plus unofficial ones with an additional $2.5 trillion USD + the UN, seven cities (I think), is in talks with central banks and has a shitload of other non-gov/non-profit partners. That’s most probably more than any other coin has, by a wide margin. 

Those are my metrics. Yours are probably different. The overarching crypto-space doesn’t have standards or common metrics. Thus, everyone focuses on something different and doesn’t understand why anyone else would invest in something else. 

Right now, it’s simply a game of “pick your own poison“. 

The test of time begins when a mainnet is launched, partners are found, first PoCs are developed and adoption begins. Before that happens, any objective comparison is hard to achieve. 

But once this happens, a new factor kicks in, I believe we are starting to witness right now: people start realizing that meaningful adoption (adoption that creates value for investors and moves the needle on CMC) will take a long time. Most probably years. 

One thing all coins have in common: The notion of an idea, or whitepaper is easier sold than actual adoption and creation of added value. Once the mainnet is launched, it’s time for all of them to show their hands.

7192,"For most, this is a difficult technology to actually understand and wrap your mind around it. When people are investing into blockchain projects, most don't actually fully understand what a blockchain even *is.* Therefore, they cannot even comprehend what problems a blockchain can *solve.* Therefore they cannot make wise decisions on what to actually invest in. So they won't put forth the time and effort to do the real research to figure out what separates one project from another because they won't understand it anyway, even if they think they do, and don't fully comprehend what it all means.

Ethereum - a sort of first mover advantage. People love vitalik and think they have the best team (they do have a big team, lots of corporations involved and publish research on a regular basis)

And so on...

As for vechain being the ONLY legitimate coin... that’s pretty much nonsense. There are a lot of great projects out there. Admittedly, even most of the greats will not stand the test of time. From reading around in all the subs, it appears this is how most people feel about their chosen coin(s). I have a lot of great things to say about both projects. 

What I can say that makes me feel Tron may have an edge is the ease of use. I read someone above state that vechain makes blockchain simple.

For someone in the know, maybe it resonates, but when we are trying to find people to mass adopt the platform, most will be lost.

And initially the project totally depends on these individuals to succeed. If they decide to quit before the project really takes off then more often than not the project fails. The challenge in any startup is to get to the point where the company has enough structure and business contacts that the founders can slowly step away and the company will remain standing. In all the honesty, that's a tough task. Most of the small businesses never get to that stage, they never get big enough to sustain themselves without the owner propping them up, and the business dies with the owner. I've had a number of small businesses close in our town around me in the last two years because the owner retired and there was no one to take over. VeChain is not that much different. The scale of what they're attempting is vast, but in the beginning, any business, VeChain including will depend on hard work of the team core of individuals driving that business, and there is always a risk that if they step away too soon it'll significantly hurt the business or maybe even kill it.

For our quality standards, we have always been somewhat ahead of the curve, however over the last year our tier 1 OEM’s that adhere to TS/ISO QA standards (NDV GL is the organization that writes the standards) have really required us to up our game on part traceability. Before we could track bad parts to a box, but now we can track it down to a mold cavity and to a shot number. To say these company don’t care about part tracking is idiotic. They key here in adoption is how painless it is because I’d agree it’s difficult to steer a mammoth company to take on a new process. This is where I believe IoT is going to be critical for integration. Sunny’s vision of VeChain and blockchain in general is passive adoption, the shipping technician who is scanning lot numbers will not have any idea that he is interacting with the blockchain. Same with the floor operators, they will have no idea that when they do their quality checks on the first and last shots that these parts are being logged to the blockchain. 
I have not even touched on the DNV GL applications of instant QA audits at your fingertips at the press of a button, think of it as EDI for QA. When they say decrease supply inefficiency it means more than just counterfeit manufacturers it also means crappy manufactures. Because current TS/ISO audits only give a glimpse of the quality process at your company at a certain time. You can be a bad manufacturer for 8 months of the year as long as you clean up before the audit happens.

I hope they return to a version of the former ad, somehow mixed with a little future... it was 'class' through and through, and reflected a true vision for where Vechain is headed.

3. Because THOR is used for transactions, its value needs to be stable. VeChain will ensure price stability by manipulating supply. Because THOR supply is determined by the production rate from VEN/VET, this means if more companies are consuming THOR they need VEN/VET to produce more THOR.
4. Imagine if THOR is originally $1 and you produce 1 per day holding 1 VEN/VET (random numbers). More companies are using the VeChain network so the demand for THOR increases, which would normally increase THOR's price (supply and demand). To counteract this, VeChain increases THOR production to 2 per day for each 1 VEN/VET. As a VEN/VET holder, you're now producing $2 per day instead of $1 per day. Your income has increased.
5. Now liken this to a dividend yielding stock. If investors were told that dividends would increase then they would buy more of the stock to take advantage of that dividend, which pushes the price of the stock up. Same for VEN/VET, as more companies join the VeChain platform and demand more THOR, the value of VEN/VET as a THOR producing asset will increase.

This entire conversation stemmed from a separate comment regarding EOS.

I saw the mention and decided to comment on the structure of VeChain as OP didn't seem to know.  I literally know nothing about VeChain beyond the fact that it's reportedly POA and I had to update the token info on MyCrypto from VEN to VET a ways back. 🤷

I do think that POA is a worthwhile exploration for enterprise / environments where a more private/permissioned system would be advantageous / testnets.

This fact in itself doesn't necessarily ""make me a fan"" of VeChain. Again, I know almost nothing about it. Obviously a robust chain and token mechanism is far more than whether its POW vs POS vs DPOS vs POA. This also means that /u/handspurs, who apparently only gets his information from misogynistic 4chan threads, doesn't need to worry about me working with VeChain. I have more than enough on my plate as it is and am quite content dedicating my efforts towards usability in this space, education, and seeing what comes of the various governance experiments happening around the ecosystem.

As I posted in the other thread, my thought on Thor is that VeChain will charge in fiat based on Thor's price. So if thor is priced at .25 and it costs .50 to access the network the price will be 2 VTHOR if it's $1 the price will be .5 VTHOR. The amount of VTHOR being produced will be based on how fast its used. I believe Oxford university is involved to help with this equation

7728,"You maybe right. I knew they had the supply side figured out but not the demand side. The only way to control both sides is by preventing hoarding. Time to live is a great way to do that. I also believe it will be beneficial for the stable value of Thor if there is time decay rather than an abrupt drop to 0 after the time expiry. Say, the value drops 3% everyday and is enforced by smart contracts that a time decayed Thor token is only worth a smaller % value of a newly minted Thor. That way people will sell as soon as they get. That will mean the coins will continuously move through the system. That gives them the demand side control as well. To make it easier, they might just automate it such that people can cycle back into VET automatically and thor gets destroyed automatically on expiry.",18-04-18-07-56,2,74,bvsat,8d0fow

I'm not sure it's a good idea to implement it right away in the early stages of VeChain.

7743,"there could be measures put in place, for example, if you held it in an exchange for n x 2 where n is your original TTL, it will get sold. There could be other measures as well, a TTL that keeps ticking and every time it moves from wallet to wallet the TTL gets reset, kind of like packets in a routed network. So sure some can play a game and keep moving their VeThor around, but 1) it will get old real quick 2) no one will want to keep moving large sums of VeThor and pay fees while moving it in/out and 3) if it doesn't not move, it must be a dead wallet and expires. 4) you can set a rule on hop count (liike traceroute in IP) where you can only go over x number of hops before it expires... all simple measures.

The easiest example here is metamask. It allows you to interact with your eth address. Metamask does not send ERC20, but you can still send ERC20 to that address and it'll be stored just the same. You can then import that address into MEW and send those tokens.

Regarding your final question: It is definitely more worth splitting all your VET into as many different wallets with 50k VET each as possible. Since you didn't participate in the first Snapshot that's what I'd recommend you to do.

Remember though that you should have all possible endings (0-9 and A-F) at least once so you are guaranteed to win every day.

The lottery that the foundation announced did 2 major things for price action (be it intentional or just a side effect).

7998,"It’s fairly self explanatory - these companies intend to utilise the VeChainThor Blockchain in one way or another. DNVGL and PwC for instance bought authority nodes, presumably they will onboard their clients and potentially be the conduit through which business is done. Maybe in the form of being paid like some sort of subscription and utilising MPP so that these companies can use Blockchain without having to own tokens.

Others will purchase and hold their tokens or others will opt for VeChain themselves to initially manage their tokens and again, through the MPP protocol still be able to make use of Blockchain services. 

The recent BMW stuff for example, they’re planning to leverage VeChain’s supply chain tech as well as their carbon solution according to a recent tweet. Anything that leverages VeChainThor Blockchain needs VTHO which comes from somewhere. Either a third party via MPP or by owning tokens themselves and generating their own VTHO or simply just buying VTHO from the market. 

For the most part,the partnerships I’ve seen so far intend to make use of the VeChainThor Blockchain which translates into burnt VTHO. But these things all take time, especially some of the bigger clients. Whilst others cry ‘overhyped’ and will say VeChain is being misleading, the reality is these things all take a long while, deals are signed for the long term and simply need time to come to fruition. By 2021, VeChain will be a monster and we’ll look back at threads like these like people do now regarding ETH in 2014. It’s quite funny how many claimed ETH was a scam, even going to great lengths to try and prove it to be true. Oh how they must weep now. 

Regarding reason for ownership, it’s simple. Metcalfe’s law is semi applicable, the value of a network is derived by its use and interconnectedness. Well VeChain stands to be huge in both metrics. Then there’s the fact the token has Intrinsic value because it produces a critical thing for the network (VTHO) which will grow in value as demand does when the network starts ramping up even further.

Over time, each VET will provide more VTHO, making it more valuable. VET can also appreciate to any price in theory, so long as the use cases keep piling in. If the network ends up being huge, it could reach the $10+ range. It may sound insane now, but this only depends on demand and value consensus. 

Nothing is guaranteed in life of course but it certainly looks as though VeChain is going to be tremendously successful. Now we just have to give it time. 2021 is where I’m looking. The market still has to undergo some major transformation yet. Regulation, mostly. It will happen through 2020/2021 and a lot of projects will probably have to cease functioning. Not VeChain though. Legal compliance is another major focus of theirs, hence my confidence it will survive :)

Also, no, tokens do not represent equity. They’re a stake in the network. If you believe the network will be valuable then by proxy, so will the tokens. But it’s not the same thing as owning equity in VeChain the company.",18-10-30-23-06,50,19642,SolomonGrundle,9sn7fu
7999,"An example of a partnership.

>TLDR: VeChain signs a partnership with Bright Foods (Group) Co. and Shanghai Xiandao Food, a significantly owned subsidiary of Bright Food which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Shanghai Municipal Government. This deal integrates VeChainThor Blockchain throughout Bright Food’s entire supply chain management and data management systems, in which they control the entire lifecycle of their product lines from crop to retail.

The details will differ per partner. Strategic ones get cheap or free VET from a special pool. PWC and DNV GL also bought equity in Vechain, which is not the same as holding VET. They do also hold VET btw.

The intrinsic value of your VET will come from generating VTHO, which enterprises will buy to fuel their blockchain transactions. As the ecosystem matures so will the demand for VTHO grow with it. As a result  the VTHO generation rate would need to be increased, increasing VET's intrinsic value.",18-10-30-23-06,8,2617,ohredditplease,9sn7fu

8001,What does partnership mean normally lol just means they’re working together ,18-10-30-23-06,-5,279,maxyo22,9sn7fu
8002,"Good response.

Also to add to that:

No one thinks that owning the token equals equity.  A weird question since I haven't seen anyone try to claim that.

There  are likely key partnerships that didn't spend a dime on a Vechain  token. DNVGL as well as most of the major shipping companies likely got  their tokens for free. Which in the long run will likely be a smart  thing. If Vechain can convince the top 3 or more shipping companies to  use their blockchain for supply chain tracking that could be huge if  Vechain then gets access to all the manufacturers that use those  shipping companies. Same goes for major compliance companies.

Holding VET/VTHO is about more than just transactions. VET will be the  value placeholder for things like smart contracts or uses where  something monetary needs to be represented on the blockchain. You could  give the transactions away for free and VET could still have value as  long as there was enough of that type of usage. You might argue that will potentially represent more of the value than the transactions  themselves under the right circumstance.",18-10-30-23-06,12,22,shillingsucks,9sn7fu
8003,Based on current price of VTHO it implies VTHO has a market cap of around $15M (based on the # of VTHO created in Year 1).  To justify VET's current market cap of around $600M then VTHO should be about 4X more.   We neeeeeeeeeeeeeeed transactions in order to create a Thor shortfall in order for VeChain to decrease the # of VTHO required per transaction in order to increase the value of our VET.,18-10-30-23-06,2,339,fantasy_football_nut,9sn7fu

The equity thing was mentioned at the bottom of OP’s post - I’ve seen a few get confused as though the tokens represent shares or something. Alas, ‘tis not the case. ",18-10-30-23-06,8,19642,SolomonGrundle,9sn7fu
8006,I would say owning tokens of VET gives you equity in the project. In the same way a share of a stock gives you equity in a company. ,18-10-30-23-06,-7,1,denialof_,9sn7fu

8008,"The tokens represent a stake in the network. For example, PwC and DNVGL bought both authority nodes and equity in VeChain itself.

8009,"I wouldn’t necessarily say that, the foundation is a non-profit organization overseeing the net work the same way a company would run operations in the stock analogy. However by owning coins or stocks, you are purchasing a small amount of equity in the overall network or company. You don’t own enough of the company to have legal rights the same way you can’t sit on the board of directors with 50 shares of Microsoft. ",18-10-30-23-06,-1,1,denialof_,9sn7fu
8010,"This just isn't correct by definition though. VET tokens are completely different than ANY sort of stake/share in the company itself. By owning VET tokens, you have a stake in the **network** only. You are ""investing"" in the value of the network itself and nothing else. 

You are *not* purchasing any sort of equity in anything. There is no legal obligation whatsoever neither from nor to you and you do not gain any of the benefits that you would if you owned equity in a real revenue-producing company. ",18-10-30-23-06,5,46599,BaconAndEgg,9sn7fu
8011,What else can you invest in besides the network? Is that not the same thing that these companies are investing in?,18-10-30-23-06,-1,1,denialof_,9sn7fu
8012,">Is that not the same thing that these companies are investing in?

No, it isn't. You do not have a legal stake in anything by buying tokens. By owning *stocks*, you are, by definition, a part-owner of the company you own stock in. You are entitled to voting rights, dividends, profit-sharing, etc. If you own 51% of a company, it is *your* company. If you were to own 51% of the VET tokens (if that were possible), you wouldn't own the VeChain Foundation or the company itself. You would just control the highest stake in in the network. 

To clarify the answer to your question though - SOME companies have chosen to buy shares or ownership in the VeChain company. Companies like PwC and DNVGL chose to buy both *tokens* (like you and I are able to buy) and *equity* in VeChain - which you and I are *not* able to buy since VeChain is not publicly traded. The majority owners in VeChain chose to sell off part of their equity in the company to places like PwC and DNVGL as a way to finance their operations. It's an extremely common thing to do for smaller companies looking to bring in more capital. 

>What else can you invest in besides the network? 

Nothing - you can't. Since ownership in VeChain, as a company, is completely independent of VET tokens. The VET network is a product that the company has produced. Owning a part of it doesn't make you an owner of the company any more than owning a Macbook makes you a part-owner of Apple.",18-10-30-23-06,5,46599,BaconAndEgg,9sn7fu
8013,"My understanding was that by ‘buying stake’ DNV-GL bought tokens from the founders at a discounted rate from the pool of tokens which were set aside to the foundation in the white paper. They bought an authority node to gain additional voting rights for the steering committee for the Foundation as well as additional Thor production. However any node can vote for the steering committee every two years once vechain reaches maturity, therefore would that not make the tokens comparable to shares in the sense that if you own enough of them you too can have a vote for steering committee leaders. In the same way any token can produce Thor which are similar to dividends. This is just my understanding just trying to learn more but the white paper does say that even economic nodes get voting powers. ",18-10-30-23-06,2,1,denialof_,9sn7fu
8014,"No, DNV GL bought an equity stake in VeChain Tech, the consultancy company that delivers the technical integrations and solutions.

If you have one single US customer holding assets on your exchange (regardless of the location of the exchange) then you have to comply with US KYC/AML regulations. Binance is not in full compliance.

They don't have to register with the SEC but they do have to comply with SEC regulations if they want to serve customers in the US.

8156,Why not make Thor not trade able and only worth money to the protocol? Skycoin uses sky hours which are currently are not trade able which makes transactions technically free to the uses but does cost skycoin hours which has no market value. Why do you guys want to trade gas or anything that uses itself as gwei? Why on earth does this make sense to anyone? Why don’t all the coins have a gas coin that’s not trade-able? Because it’s called a crypto? We can theoretically make a circulating supply unlimited and give all users enough gas based on their monthly use you could even limit it then charge consumers for an unlimited plan. This would be similar to charging businesses for database storage in essence it would be exactly the same and then people can shut up about fees. ,18-06-14-05-56,1,511,longdadipshortdatip,8qvhxs

I literally spent an hour running calculations based on hard evidence from VeChain's white paper. Did you bother checking my post history? 

1. Read the relevant section in the white paper; it is explained in detail; you can then do your own calculations and I'm confident you will arrive at the same conclusion. 
2. I am not claiming that my calculations lead to an accurate valuation of VTHO or VET; I am simply stating that, given the tps at launch, even if it were maxed out for a full year, and assuming that each transaction costs one cent, network revenue would be low, and therefore the current market capitalization indicates that VET is overvalued. THIS IS A FACT; I'm not stating a baseless opinion. 
3. How is that relevant to my discussion? I am talking about revenue generated from actual companies using VTHO once the main net launches. 
4. I did not claim that VeChain will never take off beyond 20 tps. In fact, I'm confident that we will witness exponential growth within the next 3\-7 years. I am just explaining that RIGHT NOW, we should not be scared of wild fluctuations in price because we are still in a speculative market where traders can easily play games.

There is a detailed explanation there about VTHOR generation and how much VTHO is required to cover 20 transactions per day, from which you can derive tps easily. If you still have trouble understanding how I arrived at 20 tps, let me know. I will try to explain more.
2. No reason, I was just giving an example and basing it on VeChain's claim that transaction cost will be substantially cheaper than other networks like Ethereum. 
3. True, but I'm saying RIGHT NOW, this is what we have to work with. VeChain will likely not move from 20 tps to 1000 overnight. They will require time to move existing clients and integrate new ones. This takes months / years of work. It is not easy. ",18-06-14-05-56,2,2281,snajm01,8qvhxs

8167,"Apologies if you weren't trolling, but your post actually reads very negatively in my opinion. Yes I know you are suggesting things will be good in the long run but you lay it on quite thick about VeChain being overvalued right now. Personally I don't agree. I don't think VET is undervalued but I don't think wildly over.  Otherwise I would sell now and buy back later, surely this would be sensible. I did check your history but wondered if you had recently sold up. 

1) Ok, I see 20 TPS.

2) To me, your post does read like you are asserting a price for Thor- that is the basis for everything else you write. 
Remember that your calculation relies on assumptions.  You assume that all blockchain transactions will cost the same and that that cost will be $0.01.  And in making those assumptions, you have probably assumed a level of knowledge in relation to what a blockchain transaction is, when it will be required, how this will work alongside the CHAOS database and that all applications will be similar.

See section 3.4.2 in whitepaper.  Gas required for simple payment transactions is always 2100.  Gas required for smart contract executions is variable, however.  This leaves a lot of room for variation in the cost of individual blockchain transactions.  A simple VET payment from one person to another may cost $0.01 (or less, who knows) but the cost to record temperature data from a sensor in a supply chain- or to upload a significant chunk of data to the CHAOS database may cost more.

3) It is relevant because I am asking you how VeChain will be raising 48m from digital asset returns if it is not from Thor generation using the VET in their own possession. That figure is a short term projection from the foundation which does not seem to fit with your short term projection.

4) Ok, but 'sell now and buy back later' would surely be a better option than 'stay calm and waste an opportunity' if VET is as overvalued right now as you feel?

Further to the above, have you considered that not all transactions will be funded using Thor bought from open market?  Some network users will be VET holders using their own Thor.  This would lower your valuation even further as some of the 20 TPS (maybe even most) would be freebies.  I am not blinkered- happy to see both sides of the argument- but every method of valuing the network has its flaws as there are just too many unknowns.",18-06-14-05-56,3,220,_Bob_Bobson_,8qvhxs

Bottom line is that those who can afford to buy a bulk of VET to generate a steady stream of VTHO is in a good position. Those who don't, will have to buy and stock up on VTHO (which I recommend they do when VTHO dumps). I think VTHO might stay pretty stable because there will always be a constant stream of sellers but also buyers.

Around the same size is fine in my opinion to say. Referencing pure numbers, sure it’s a bit less. What about connections? What about peaking in a new industry that gives VeChain legitimacy in. Think about all the implications of partnering with a Shanghai Municipal Company that large, with many connections and intertwined with the government under Chinese administration.

Everything else you even admit is SUPER f’ing trivial in the grand scheme of things. I get you’re looking out for your money, as all of us are. It’s just insulting to a degree to come on /r/VeChain and see people feel “worrysome” over partnering with a $25b/year company instead of another $33b/year company, when in reality these partnerships are the biggest the cryptosphere has ever seen. Name any other coin that’s actively integrating its Blockchain solutions with 3 companies that combined have over $80 billion in revenue per year (PWC, Bright Foods, DNV-GL). When one of the top 3 Chinese insurance companies actually does announce, it will be minimally another $40billion /year company. (Source: China Pacific Insurance is the third largest in China and brings in $40b/yr and has 12% market share, so that’s the lowest it can be. 

This is the biggest feat in crypto since the original bitcoin genesis block was mined... in 6 weeks, companies with net worth + assets worth over $1 Trillion dollars will all be integrating into the VET/THOR network, causing an insane spike in demand. And all of this is only what is known before mainnet. Imagine once the wheels get actually turning and more companies see the potential of this Blockchain solution...

I am calling it here, VeChain will be the first coin that consistently doesnt follow bitcoin’s trail in price. This will be due to the uproar of demand on the enterprise level. There is an actual use case for holding VeChain regardless of price. Buying Thor, using and burning it will also have its own economy. This is true double pen.

We are on the same team, didn’t mean to really insult you, kind of was just irritated and meant it like “this post is super dumb and shouldn’t even exist.” Regardless, apologies for that. I’m not a shill, VeChain is about 20% of my 11 coin portfolio, so there would be a lot of shilling needed if I were like this with every project I’m vested in. It’s just, I realize the potential upscale and we should really take a delve into that over the trivial ama’s, contest update delays, etc. because that’s just not what it’s about. What it IS about, is that many huge companies in different industries have assessed the risk of backing an incubator Blockchain project like VeChain and has so much faith in it, that they’ve stalled their name to the coin via their entire Supply management system.

9187,"Since most coins have a limited supply, simple demand economics dictate that the price for a coin will rise providing new buyers continually arrive and some holders are willing to sell. The less volume being sold, the higher the price goes (assuming demand is growing). Use https://www.coinmarketcap.com to check the circulating supply of a coin.

What drives demand? 

Much like VCs investing in startups or pension funds investing in stocks: people looking for returns. For the new coins/tokens, demand is mainly driven by FOMO and a desire to get in early while perceived x10, x100 or x1000 gains are still possible should the coin ""take off"" like BTC, ETH, NEO, DASH etc. Probability of a coin ""taking off"" is mainly judged by team, ability to hype, imagined size of potential market for the proposed solution, number (and quality/size) of exchanges the coin can be bought on, how disruptive the technology is, likelihood of ""partnerships"" that could move the price in the future, ""uniqueness"" of offering in a crowded market. That's pretty much it (not dissimilar to how venture capitalists go about investing in early stage startups) .

Edit: to further the VC analogy

The best tactic is to maintain a diversified portfolio across various crypto currencies. You hope 5% to 10% of your bets will come off in a big way to make up for 90% to 95% of your losses/duds.

X-node holders were NOT allowed to go BELOW their initial X-node status AFTER March 20th OR lose their status FOREVER. VeChain changed that rule some 2 weeks ago and look at the results now.

9350,"Firearms on a blockchain is interesting. This is one of the first thoughts I had when I was introduced to blockchain but this is such a massively contentious genre. First, it has the potential to significantly reduce the efforts necessary to track firearm crimes. It won't stop them obviously, but it can help *reduce* the amount of illegally or unethically procured weapons. Having all firearms on a blockchain can also help to identify the bad actors in regards to trafficking. Again...help....not solve completely.

With that said, there are some massive hurdles to get over. For one, any firearm owner in their right mind SHOULD NOT want their info and firearm ownership publicized on a public ledger. There would need to be some sort of unique identifier but even then, the risk of that info being leaked could have some very unfortunate ramifications. Imagine a criminal being able to use a blockchain tied to a UID database to find out that you have x number of guns, along with your name and possibly your address. Game over.

Someone also pointed out that the whole idea of Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) is to create a disconnect from government oversight. The whole ""be your own bank"" concept. Well, this would do the opposite. Granted, this already exists theoretically through the serialization system and federal databases but putting it on a blockchain would be perceived as a much more ""big brother"" effort and would be extremely harshly rebuked by certain ""establishments"".

Lastly, and this is half serious/half joking speculation, but certain governmental entities (3-letter folks that I won't call out) wouldn't look too fondly on their trafficking systems being put up on blast via a public ledger. If all manufacturers are required to list their products on a blockchain but those ""entities"" don't want their hardware tracked, this will only push them to more deeply solidify their efforts to hide the movements and create even more ""off the grid"" firearms.

I'm all for finding ways to use blockchain to reduce crime but ""guns on the blockchain"" is going to be a tremendous uphill battle.

So this is a long term hold. It might take 5 years to see the biggest companies adopt it. While 20,000 VET might not seem like much now, in 5 years it could be generating you so much passive income.

For instance, if you delete your Facebook, they actually keep a ghost account for you and still sell your data. Really depends on how consumer sentiment towards this changes in the future.

Because of this, we are always going to hear different opinions about the way VeChain markets the company.  At the end of the day, we are seeing the transformation of a small crypto project that easily can continue down the path of becoming a massive front runner in this space.

9618,"To start off, I watched the whole thing. Your delivery and explanations of the various use cases were very well done and your bit on the significance of DNV GL and PWC was on point.

However, you misrepresented VeChain in that you lumped it into a supply chain token category. Although supply chain and anti-counterfeiting are use cases that VeChain has (and will continue to) implement, they are so much more than that. It's like identifying Microsoft as ""a company that makes office software"" (such as Word, Excel, etc.) Although this is a big part of Microsoft, it wouldn't be fair to classify them as such and is a poor representation of everything that they have to offer. VeChain, like Microsoft, is so much more.

Why is this important? Since your video seems to be targeting those unfamiliar or new to VeChain, it is misleading and does not paint the entire picture.

So to the point. VeChain should be classified as a platform. It's competitors are the like of Ethereum, EoS, NEO, etc. 

Anything you can do on any of the above is available on VeChain. And VeChain does it better than all of those (I would say arguably, but there's nothing that suggests that its NOT better.)

Already 3 ICO's have been anounced. Furthermore, Decent.bet (DBET) will be moving from the Ethereum blockchain to VeChain (an gambling and sports betting token.)

Even more importantly, the VeChain blockchain upon launch will have more enterprise solutions running on their platform than all other platform based blockchains **COMBINED.**

That being said, I believe that the supply chain aspects of VeChain are BY FAR the most exciting and interesting aspects.

I think that revolutionizing the way that data is collected in the real world is something that the community should weight much higher than more ICOS.

""VeChain should be classified as a platform. It's competitors are the like of Ethereum, EoS, NEO, etc.""

While this may be true, it isn't the whole truth. Since VeChain does have a huge focus on supply chain management, lumping it in with these projects is equally misleading. I don't think that comparing those platforms directly to VeChain does it justice either.

9622,"> That being said, I believe that the supply chain aspects of VeChain are BY FAR the most exciting and interesting aspects.

I agree. Mostly because these are some of the best applications of blockchain as a solution - they solve problems that otherwise are difficult to fix without and that's where VeChain *initially* started. Which leads to my next point...

>While this may be true, it isn't the whole truth. Since VeChain does have a huge focus on supply chain management, lumping it in with these projects is equally misleading. I don't think that comparing those platforms directly to VeChain does it justice either.

I disagree here entirely, and comparing it to Wabi, Walton, Modum is flat out incorrect and a disservice to your viewers. I'm not sure you understand the entire scope of VeChain (I don't mean that in a bad way, just trying to educate - there's 1500+ ""coins"", I don't expect you to know their intricate details AND old, incorrect information is abundant.) Although VeChain may have started in supply chain management and anti counterfeiting, I assure you they are not contained to it. Just as Nintendo started as a playing card company, their scope evolved to something so much greater.

While Ethereum and NEO have taken the approach of ""we built this public blockchain for you to use, make some dApps on it,"" VeChain has adopted an entirely different approach. They have adopted the Apple technique. What I mean by this is, rather than creating a platform and letting other people develop apps for it, Apple started by creating the very first apps to ""show"" developers the endless possibilities. Once people saw the power of apps, THEN independent developers started creating their own things. VeChain has done the same thing. They created different solutions to show HOW and WHY. Supply Chain and Anti-counterfeiting were the first, but they have so many other solutions in the pipeline. But that shouldn't lump them into the Supply Chain category.  They're doing insurance, they're doing a carbon bank, they're banking the unbanked, and so so much more. They have so much in the pipeline, and that only involves the stuff THEIR in house developers are doing. This doesn't include the ICO's (things only platforms support) nor does it include all the dApps developers like myself can build on their platform.

Edit: I re-read your response, and realized I did the classic ""I have an idea, start typing, forget my initial idea, think about 15 different ideas, misconstrue **your** original point, build off the incorrect version of what I thought you said, and then proceed to ramble."" My bad. I'll leave what I typed up there anyway in case you find any of it useful. Lol. Thanks for your contributions to the community though :)

If you are hodling Vechain, you would be either delusional or went full retard when NOT locking up for a node status before March 20th. Since this lockup has absolutely NO RISK (that is if you decided to hodl Vechain longterm, since you are already in Vechain) and it will only give you benefits.

The ICO whitelisting, I mean, BitOcean ICO is gonna skyrocket and you can quote me on that. Lockups means less circ supply means price of Vechain going up, means higher rank on CMC means more investor money coming into Vechain. It's a win/win.

That sounds more like speculation than truth. I'm glad we have the token lock ups.

BTC can drop that low, although it may not (the bulls are putting up a good fight), b/c of a number of issues.

  
1. First being that it is a very basic application of the blockchain, and a VERY ambitious one (supplanting Fiat).  The perspective has already started to shift into becoming a ""store of wealth."" 

2. The short market.  Once Bitcoin was able to be shorted there became a massive incentive for people to manipulate the price downward b/c you can make a killing shorting it.  This is especially effective b/c of the relatively small size of the bitcoin market.  Very few people even have a clue what Bitcoin is, even fewer are in the market like us.  Small market, easy to manipulate.  Short market is dangerous for longterm viability. 

3. A lack of new blood.  If we have a lack of new cash flowing into the market.  The people who were willing to take the risk did in late 2018... and have gotten taken to the cleaners... 

4. Speculation.  What drives any of this, or even the stock market for that matter, but it's much more apparent here.  Blockchain is amazing technology, the next internet, and everyone from Long Island Iced Tea to Venezuela wants to capitalize, which is fine, but when you have no regulation you get a watered down market fulllllllll of shit.  DOGEcoin, Tron, MadeSafeCoin... just run through it and see how many of the projects are valued at a half a billion dollars and don't even have an actual product.... some without even a white paper.... by definition, that is speculation.  At least Pets.com had a product. 

If it's the Node question, let me know and I'll expand on that.  Fact is mate, a healthy about of skepticism is wise.  Blockchain is for real, but the crypto market is like a roulette wheel right now.

I've tried and some values changed (the public key obviously hasn't changed), but I'm just wondering why is that a possibility at all.

The JSON keystore file contains your private key, do not ever lose that, make multiple copies and store it in multiple places in case of theft or house fire or whatnot. MEW also should have asked you to create a password to encrypt the JSON keystore file. Do not ever lose that password either, keep it written down and store it in multiple places.

The weak hands thing is crap to me, I just don't see the point in holding in a market controlled by one king when that king is in total flux... too damn risky for one, and on the other hand, just the right amount of risk to better your holdings in the market once it regains it's footing.

10280,"50tps seems a little low but realistic in the near term.

Perhaps another angle could be to assume that all VTHO generated is burned (excluding node bonuses).

I.e. ~55,000,000,000 circulating VET x 0.000432 producing 23,760,000 VTHO a day x 365 = 8,672,400,000 VTHO per year.

Assuming your 50tps, that would be 8,672,400,000/1,576,800,000 = 5.5VTHO/transaction. 

If 1 transaction costs $0.01, then 1 VTHO will be worth $0.0018. At 7% return, 1 VET should be around $0.004. This will be worth less when we include Node bonuses.

However, I believe tps will be in the 100s if not 1000s. So at 1000tps, VET should be around $0.082 (~8x current prices).

I'm just planning on putting the mnemonic key somewhere safe and deleting the wallet app but I don't want to lose the VTHO I've already generated or future VTHO that's being generated in cold storage. In the future I'll just reload the mnemonic key either on the same wallet app but maybe a different device or even wallet. Is this the correct way of doing it? Will it still generate VTHO and will I still have all the VTHO I've already generated? i.e. is the VET and VTHO I already have/will generate in the future all stored on the same mnemonic key?",18-08-04-15-43,1,58,xmrhero,94gwdr

10324,"If you put the mnemonic key somewhere safe and delete the wallet app, yes, you will keep your current VTHO and continue accruing VTHO on that account. This all happens on the blockchain, not your wallet; the wallet is only in essence ""reading"" the blockchain and allowing you to interact with it.

When you eventually restore your wallet, you will see your VET there, along with a higher balance of VTHO. Also, you can check your balance anytime and see your VTHO increasing by using VeChain Thor block explorer: [https://www.vescan.io/account/list](https://www.vescan.io/account/list) You can watch your VTHO grow over time in the listed balance.

Just enter your public address (NOT mnemonic key or seed), and you can see your updated balances whenever you want. This is actually much safer than using a mobile wallet as you don't have to worry about phone theft/hacks.",18-08-04-15-43,2,220,youhaveaprettymouth,94gwdr

Remember to have at least the same amount of VET as you did in the June snapshot (VEN x 100)

""In order to receive the VET reward after each snapshot, you need to lock up the corresponding amount of VET in your wallet address compared to your prior VEN balance.""

-  You must not go below the number of VET you had in your wallet after this snapshot until September 1st. If you do, you will lose X-Node status forever!


For example, if I had 6,200 VEN in my ETH X-Node address during the first June snapshot, I need AT LEAST 620,000 VET in my bound X-Node VET address in the Vechain Mobile Wallet.

10416,"I'm quoting from your website: ""If the price is below the fair value is because the market thinks its usage is going to decrease with respect to the reference currency. Whether it will do or not is what the investor has to analyze. The opposite applies if the price is higher than perceived fair value. In this later case, it is the investor's responsibility to decide whether the currency is too expensive and they should sell, or they can determine wether the usage of the currency with respect to the reference currency is going to increase, and thus the fair value is also likely to correct upwards. This very same principle applies to fundamental investing in stocks.""
In other words: the fair value doesn't have any practical meaning, does it?",18-07-26-06-15,1,810,larry_fink,91veqw

10419,You are welcome!,18-07-26-06-15,1,389,coinfairvalue,91veqw
10420,"Yes it does. For instance, it allows Warren Buffet buy when a company is cheap. In the example of Warren Buffet, what he does is he discounts expected free cash flows and arrives to a **Fair Value**. Comparing the price with the **Fair Value**, he detects if the market is being very pessimistic with respect to his (Warren Buffet's) expected free cash flows. Then he thinks again and tries to understand if being that pessimistic makes sense in the particular case -due to something he has forgotten to take into account in his expected free cash flows-, or it is just people participating in the market being excessively depressed. If the case is the latter, then he buys cheap. When people recover from being excessively pessimistic, Warren Buffet profits. He doesn't know when people will stop being pessimistic, he just has to be patient.

There is no difference in between the Discounted Free Cash Flows model and the CFV model, but just that one is for stocks and the other is for currencies.

If you don't like it, then you don't like fundamental investing. I suggest that you discuss the concept of **Fair Value** with the academics in the Assets Pricing department of a School of Economics, not with me.",18-07-26-06-15,1,389,coinfairvalue,91veqw

And precisely, because they are fundamentally different, they require a different rational model (the CFV model in this case). Nonetheless, being fundamentally different assets does not mean they can't both have a price, as well as it does not mean they can't both have a fair value. Fair value, in the theory of assets pricing, is universal. It applies to every traded asset I am afraid. What changes is the medium you have to use to arrive to it (the model).",18-07-26-06-15,1,389,coinfairvalue,91veqw
10425,"I don't think you're understanding my point.
You're model might be mathematically correct, but it doesn't have any relevance for real life. In the chart in the medium post you can clearly see that the fair value is following the market price, not the other way around. How does knowing ""your"" fair value help you?
It's a nice calculation and it is certainly elegant, but eventually it's not applicable in real life and (apparently) wrong. ",18-07-26-06-15,1,810,larry_fink,91veqw
10426,Check all the charts in https://www.coinfairvalue.com and see if that is the case for every coin. Judge for yourself.,18-07-26-06-15,1,389,coinfairvalue,91veqw
10427,"It's the case for 50% of the coins - as you'd expect from a binomial distribution with p=0.5 (aka a random ""coin flip"").",18-07-26-06-15,2,810,larry_fink,91veqw
10428,"I am sure you have actually downloaded the data and coded a program to check this claim. And even though you found some percentage of failure/success of an strategy based on fair value, that wouldn't indicate randomness at all. The randomness test of a binomial variable is way harder that checking if the average is 50%. Example: I could force a coin to face head every odd minute and tail every even minute. I can take the average and see it is 50%; nonetheless I cannot claim the position of the coin is a random variable with a binomial distribution.

Even if you found a 50% odds in your strategy with the fair value, it wouldn't mean there are no additional clues that would help you predict if it is signalling a proper buy/sell or just a random one. I remind you that there are many variables in the model which you can incorporate as clues, such as the basket average values or the velocity (willingness to trade savings). I also remind you that we, in CoinFairValue, use moving averages for some variables. Checking what's going on in between the moving averages and the current values help a lot in the interpretation of the fair value.

Fair values work the same way with stocks. There is always uncertainty, there is never certainty that a price will come back to the fair value a model is signaling. Life is pure uncertainty. The purpose of CoinFairValue is giving people the tools to understand where currencies derive their value from. How usage is connected with value. That is key for understanding fundamental investing. For instance, if you are going to do fundamental investing in stocks, you would be crazy if you went out there without models and without the corresponding financial reports of the companies.

You can deny it or criticize it, but it is what it is. If you don't like fundamental investing, it is better that you ignore it. Anyways, I am sure you will be a loyal visitor https://www.coinfairvalue.com, for you are smart.",18-07-26-06-15,1,389,coinfairvalue,91veqw

10435,"I don't have all the answers/details, but I would imagine for some... buying enough $VET to generate the $VTHO they need might be too expensive (considering you need 48,600 $VET to generate 21 $VTHO per day. 

(21 $VTHO is the standard cost of one VET transaction)

So that 48,600 $VET would cost a business about $1200 by todays prices which would allow them to handle 1 transaction per day.  Each additional daily transaction needed increases the cost of $VET another 1200.

So 50 transactions per day, an enterprise would need $60,000.

Now if a company is short $60k, but still wants enough $VTHO for 50 transactions per day.  They can go out and by 50\*21 $VTHO on an exchange...  

50\*21=1050

1050\*0.04 = $42  (.04 is current price of $VTHO)

$42\*365 = $15330 cost per year if price of $VTHO stays flat.

Of course, I'm just throwing darts and I'm sure the minutiae is much more complicated.  I am just trying to provide you one scenario as to why one might buy $VTHO on an exchange rather then buy $VET.

Here are a couple things to clear up the confusion:

**ERC tokens vs new VET tokens:**
The tokens you see in MEW are the original ERC VeChain tokens. It is confusing because they call them VET while other exchanges used VEN.

**Token Swap:**
Eventually you will want to swap your ERC VeChain tokens (called ""VET"" on MEW) for the new VET tokens at a 1:100 ratio. Many people did this through exchanges, however it is too late for many exchanges such as Binance. VeChain Foundation will provide a token swap service after X-node binding ends.

**X-node binding:**
You'll need to bind your current MEW wallet to a new VET wallet if you want to keep your X-node status.",18-07-25-05-13,1,188,jlaumans,91kelh

In regards to your Ledger showing 6.2k VET, instead of VEN: this is not a worry. VET is just the ticker and is essentially the same thing as VEN. It only 100x after you perform token swap. 

If you are unable to send the 0.01 VEN/VET from Ledger wallet to bind X-node, maybe make sure you have ETH in your Ledger wallet to pay for gas fees!

Watch this for a better understanding

RFID/NFC/QR code solutions can be added on at any point from supplier onwards.

VeThor will be used to power any interaction with the blockchain. Uploading any data to the VeChainThor network will require VeThor. 

In the future, DNV-GL have mentioned doing ridiculous shit like putting the DNA of a grape onto the blockchain. That would be at the raw material level.... I don't see that happening soon though.

Happy to answer any other questions if you still have any.


_________________________

Now to address your example directly,

> A broccoli farmer sells his crop to a supplier/packaging facility. In the process of packaging this facility attaches a measuring device, whether that’s RFID, a QR code, or something else. 

Farmer = raw materials. Supplier can attach the IoT device at this point. Alternatively it can be attached later on the supply chain after the raw materials have been manufactured closer towards their end product.

> The processing facility (who holds VET) then attaches Thor to this measuring device, for this example let’s say it’s 1 Thor per package, and that 1 Thor=$1. So they ship out 50 packages, mark up the shipment $50.

Manufacturer. They do not ""attach"" VeThor to the device. However, to upload the item to the blockchain will require VeThor to power that smart contract. Each item does not contain any VeThor, however to put the item onto the blockchain has an associated cost. The items may be marked up by the associated cost.

> The buyer, a grocery store, receives the items, pays the premium and stocks the shelves. The buyer doesn’t have any direct interaction with any tokens or ecosystem, they just put it on the shelf.

You've skipped distribution. This is the retailer. Yes they may pay a price premium. However there is a possibility it may be a price discount as VeChain could make other areas of the supply chain more efficient through automation.

> A customer buys the package after scanning the RFID/QR label and sees the temperature and location history.

Yup. But anyone can do this, not just limited to the customer. Also, anyone can add to the product identity on the blockchain as long as they hold it and have VeThor. This is the MyStory DApp that has been released by DNV GL for wine tracking.

> Where does the Thor go? After it’s sold to the final customer, does it return to the supplier who packaged it? To the grocery store? does the customer get to keep it? or is it simply burned?

70% gets burnt. 30% goes to authority nodes who run the VeChainThor network and validate smart contract execution and transactions. It does not go to anyone else on the supply chain. The entity that spent the VeThor definitely does not keep it. 

> Is it best to have the only direct interaction to the ecosystem in this case, just with the facility that packages it? I don't see a need for the grocery store or farmer to have any interaction at all in terms of purchasing VET or Thor.

It depends who you are and what your goal is. A large grocery store franchise (e.g. Walmart, 7-11) may find utility in having VET or VeThor to improve their supply chain efficiency. They will want to add information to the items such as which distribution channel it is in, where it is going, temperature of item during transit etc. This will all take VeThor to add this information to the blockchain.",18-03-12-15-46,5,13802,enozym111,83sfys
10677,"VET is seen as a 'supply chain coin'- but its aspirations are now far grander than this.  VET began as a supply chain coin but is now a platform and future use cases will be diverse. We don't know much about the BitOcean ICO yet but I doubt it will have much to do with supply chains.  All transactions on VeChain network will be paid for using THOR, regardless of use case.
One of the most exciting examples of possible applications I have seen is this:  If Renault and BMW both adopt the VeChain 'car passport' system- and perhaps more vehicle manufacturers, an insurance company might see opportunity in writing a third party Dapp which taps into this data on the blockchain and uses it to issue insurance certificates directly.  For me, this is exciting because there is potential for a snowball effect here as more and more applications are conceived. Public blockchains are about sharing data between entities in ways which could not be done before and this is what makes the whole thing so powerful IMO.",18-03-12-15-46,3,220,_Bob_Bobson_,83sfys

""something just doesn't seem right anymore"" - it doesn't feel right because you didn't time the market well and aren't making 30% returns in 2 days?  


The people who make money in crypto are patient.  They aren't going from CND to XVG to BCC to whatever shitcoin is next, timing the market perfectly and with prescience and making 30% a day bouncing around.  Every good project will moon eventually.  You just have to hodl until it does.  


Studies of much more rational markets than crypto have shown that day trading is a bad strategy for the vast majority of people and you're better off just buying and holding and being patient.

Since the main net and split the coin is no longer and investment.  Yeah, nobody wants to hear this but it’s the truth. The most recent paper clearly stated the direction going forward but nobody on here could comprehend or just wanted to dream. 

The token was never going to be useable at $1 - 8 or whatever. This is why the split was done. Once a coin has a planned use it is no longer an investment. VET doesn’t care about crypto investors, they care about on-boarding potential partners... even if at the expense of investors. If the token price is high no partner will hold and use the token. It’s just too much money to lock up. There’s more to this but you can do the research to learn more.

VET increased the supply to an astronomical number. High supply is a bad thing for price. This is a fact that cannot be disputed in crypto. Just look at the high supply coin prices. The split was calculated to make sure VET would hover around a couple of pennies.  

If you want to learn more about VET don’t use these article submissions. Read the paper 10 times. It’s so clear if you read between the lines.

10796,"So, an important thing to bear in mind is that the volume does not really represent how many people are selling (this was true on the way up as well).  The bulk of the order book on both the buy and the sell sides are the same people, that's why you see exactly the same stacking patterns at each resistance point no matter what happens.  When a resistance gets cracked, the vast volume of the sales that happen are the same people selling into their own orders to provide the appearance of momentum.  This happened on the way up too.  It is not the case that 5-10% of the entire coin supply is changing hands on a daily basis (volume was sometimes as high as 20% going up).  Most of this is coins going back and forward in the same account.  What we do have right now is very low amounts of non-whale orders - people aren't risking catching the knife so the value of the organic orders that need to be dumped on to break a resistance line is extremely low.  Recycling just a few million dollars worth of coins, you could push this price point around pretty much as you wish at the moment, until either someone with deeper pockets comes along and stops your game by putting more momentum in the other direction or enough news comes along to start pushing things up organically as people see the price as irresistible.

10919,"It's more neutral than you'd think.

To clarify, JD is using Hyperledger, which is IBM's private, permissioned blockchain.  Aka, it's pretty much just a database and they have full control over it, it's opaque to the public and doesn't have a crypto attached to it.

The difference with VeChain is that it's a public, trustless chain, meaning that it's not owned/controlled by a single entity, but rather owned by a network of people.  This means when you scan an item, you know for sure, that the data was true, transparent, and never altered, unlike an item that was scanned from a blockchain controlled by a private company, where you have to ""trust"" that the data is actually true.  

""Trusting"" companies has failed time and time again, from Enron, to China's Vaccine/Baby Milk Scandal, to the Great Recession.  A large part of the cause of the Great Recession in 2008 was ""trusting"" ratings agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's to analyze/rate bonds appropriately - i.e. AAA if they were solid/minimal risk and say BB if they were very risky.  These ""trusted"" companies began hiding data and rating shit bonds that should have been B or C as AAA - which in a large part, lead to the financial collapse as ""AAA"" bonds collapsed since they were actually junk/extremely risky.

&#x200B;

The bottom line is, VeChain is highly positioned as the single best Public Blockchain out there for supply chain.  VeChain also has additional features, such as being a platform for dApps, and allowing a person to ""transfer"" a good into their name(i.e. Buy a Rolex from a store, have them scan the NFC Chip and have it transferred into your name).  It also allows unique systems that wouldn't otherwise be possible, such as the Carbon Credits program.

&#x200B;

Even if 90% of companies use a private blockchain and 10% use a Public Blockchain, VeChain will be in an excellent position and valued far higher than it is now.  Eventually, as the space matures, I think we'll see more companies opting and moving for a public blockchain, rather than a private one.  Also, companies can be reluctant to use private chains, such as IBM's/Maersk Shipment Blockchain, which failed to see any adoption.  The other shipment companies refused to use it, since they wouldn't actually own any of it, and Maersk/IBM would control the full rights  to the blockchain - This is exactly the issue that VeChain solves by being public/owned by many.

1st off the only way someone could malicious add false data to the blockchain is if the sensor recorded a false reading.

So this sensor would just give off odd random patterns of false information.

10951,"A paragraph from the whitepaper that was released today:
> Despite being a major technological milestone, Ethereum has not been made suitable for hosting
large-scale commercial decentralized applications (DApps) that could engage our day-to-day
activities. One of the main reasons is that there hasn’t been an effective governing structure set
up, from the very beginning, for Ethereum to allow efficient and transparent transitions
(upgrades) of itself to adapt to new challenges. Secondly, Ethereum lacks a suitable economic
model to allow enterprises to run their DApps with a controllable and predictable cost.
Considering the level of volatility of the Ether price, it is almost impossible for companies to
predict the future price of Ether or the cost of running a DApp based on Ethereum for a period of
time.
The VeChainThor Blockchain is designed to tackle the above problems. It does not just provide
pure technical solutions but is empowered by novel governance and economic models, which, we
believe, will push forward broader blockchain adoption and the creation of ecosystems with more
trust and efficiency. The VeChainThor Blockchain is not built from scratch, but upon some of the
essential building blocks of Ethereum (e.g., the account model, EVM, modified Patricia tree and
RLP encoding method). But most importantly, it is packed with technical features that are tailormade
for the actual needs of both enterprise and individual users. We believe that the new
features give both users and developers added flexibility and powerful tools to achieve their goals
on the VeChainThor Blockchain.

3. If a big blue-chip name like IBM is brining public attention/awakening to the need for trust, authenticity... then so be it.  Let people wet their beak on IBM's solution and learn about how Vechain does it better.

4. I like the quick blockchain commercials that IBM does.

11081,"Yes, IBM is a competitor. And IBM has all the resources in the world to make it happen. It also has connections to just about everybody. So on one hand I think IBM is a formidable competitor. On the other hand I'm not sure I see a point behind private blockchain. Why even bother with blockchain technology if it's going to be private? From IBM's perspective how is that better than just a bunch of clustered databases? And from IBM customer perspective, they're still putting all their trust in a single company, trusting that IBM will keep records accurate, that it will keep proper backups, and that it will take proper security precautions against any malicious intruder. Public blockchain provides all of these benefits automatically, I'm not so sure that a private blockchain can. So I am indeed afraid that private blockchains such as IBM will crush their competitors simply due to market advantage and public ignorance about blockchain technology, but I do hope that public blochain/vechain win.",18-04-27-21-35,1,55,-Voland-,8faybp

Read the Apotheosis II (found here \^ if you scroll back) for greater understanding. However, and this can not be over-stated, strongly recommend and encourage you to read all of the VeChain Foundation medium posts. It's well worth the time it takes to do so. Everyone of them has useful information contained. Similar to Gestalt, reading them all for the fullest picture is where it's at. They're so good and useful for understanding this masterpiece that enjoy re-reading them with greater context. Takes time, but just start chipping away and then a light-bulb will go off and you'll start to voraciously read (and you will have seen for yourself). Trust me on this and welcome ! Wait...just recognized your handle. Weren't you here this month or last ? Either way, welcome, and read - is beyond worth doing ! :)

Most people will compound the VTHO for VET to generate more VTHO (enterprises will actually use their VTHO to execute smart contracts) other than when there is a dApp that requires some VTHO that a user wants to utilize . Compounding will have great effects on things - is always the case. Doing this makes all the sense in the world on one hand, but am trying to figure out if there would ever be a case where it's best to accumulate and save VTHO in anticipation of demand as more on-boarding has occurred and as transaction levels reach certain heights - though being able to generate more by increasing your VET is a great way to go. Am trying to exhaust all possibilities and decide. Is a great decision to have to make. 

There may be a function in the wallets that allows for re-investment of VTHO for VET, but this has not been confirmed so though likely or possible at worst, we'll have to wait and see. Good luck, and for reals - read those medium posts ! You'll haVe a eureka moment and learn to loVe them if you simply dive-in and do it - trust me on this one !

11334,"There is a lot of information out there already - the whitepaper goes in to depth about VTHO. I recommend giving it a read if you wish to know more. 

To address your points - their goal is not to create a semi stable coin in terms of fiat value, but to allow *transaction cost stability*. The price will be dictated by the market. What they can control is the consumption rate of VTHO per transaction, which allows costs to the end user to be stabilised by reducing the amount of VTHO consumed per transaction. Eventually, demand for VTHO will start to outstrip supply rate. At this point, the foundation can then increase the amount of VTHO produced per VET, which in turns make VET more valuable as it performs more work within the ecosystem by providing more VTHO. 

VET is the proverbial golden goose, VTHO is the egg in this scenario. But it must be stressed - there is no intention to manage the cost of VTHO, only to maintain transaction price stability. This is a major factor enabling VeChain’s adoption. Transaction costs for other projects become prohibitive as their main token appreciates in value. VeChain has solved that issue with this model.",18-09-12-11-57,3,19642,SolomonGrundle,9f3lzb

By leveraging Vechain they have an opportunity to connect and guarantee the authenticity of their products directly to their customers, while also making it a powerful marketing touch point to tell a brand or product story, and gather useful data. ie: Customers would download an official app and scan their handbag to verify its authenticity, as well as see marketing content or the lifecycle and story behind the product.

Explanation:
When there is no light, everything is black. Test this out by going into a photographic dark room. There are no photons of light. In other words, there are no photons of colors.

2. White is the blending of all colors and is a color.

Explanation:
Light appears colorless or white. Sunlight is white light that is composed of all the colors of the spectrum.  A rainbow is proof. You can't see the colors of sunlight except when atmospheric conditions bend the light rays and create a rainbow. You can also use a prism to demonstrate this.

Equally, they are not required to keep the network running, now the 101 nodes are operational as the 101 nodes between themselves form a consensus. 

That being said, the means to approve another entity to take over an authority node is within their control at present, with voting and governance to be developed in the coming months.

If the foundation makes a ton of money while the price of the token tanks, we have no recourse to their profit. However, if the foundation decides to move on, we still have a stake in the network. Depending on the adoption level, the network won't go to zero overnight. What you end up with is not a shareholding of the foundation but rather the network's value of utility ie you will still get whatever value the economic model of the network prescribes to the token. A buyout of the foundation, for whatever reason, will not cause the network to go to zero (assuming it's up and running which it should be else why would anyone buy out an unsuccessful foundation).

Imagine all of the companies together need to pay for $130M worth of service on the platform. By what mechanism can the market cap of thor be much higher than this?

In year 1 there is 134M Thor.  In Year 2 there could be 174M Thor used.  Will 30% of that go back to them in Year 3?

11691,"It depends on the production rate. If the production rate were too high then yes, you would get inflation above demand and our dividends would drop every year while the transaction processors would earn more and more every year because they hold a higher and higher percentage of the Thor every year. But if the production rate were set to 70% of the value needed then the Thor supply could stay constant. Hopefully they get this right.

1- VeChain need VET to be valuable so it can be used as a means of transfering value in the VeChain ecosystem.  This is best achieved if it has value in the world at large- not just among members of the ecosystem- because the potential for liquidity is far greater.

2- VET produces VTHO, which will (eventually) have a stable value by virtue of the USD pumped in every day by enterprise.  This will incentivise holding of VET, thereby reducing price volatility and reliance on BTC.

3- Economic nodes 'lock up' VET, reducing available supply and encouraging price rises (demand v supply).

11854,"I'm honestly shocked at how horribly uninformed the /r/vechain community is about this. Not directing that at you, OP, but at the ignorant people spamming ""you can't"" or just unhelpfully pasting the veforge site link. I've seen so many people asking how to do this and not ONCE have I seen someone give a correct answer. When I have time tonight, I may make a standalone post to address it, but until then, here's a quick step-by-step.

Note that this method DOES use the mobile VeChainThor app, but it DOES NOT require moving any funds to the mobile app.

Once you have the VET ledger app installed, you can download the VET mobile app and add your VET ledger address as an ""observed"" address. From there, you can initiate a token swap via the app. You register your ERC20 VEN ledger address first and then bind the address by sending 0.01 ERC20 VEN to the intermediary address. Since you chose your ledger address as your VET token swap address, the VeChain Foundation's VET address will send 1 VET to your ledger address (the equivalent of 0.01 ERC20 VEN). 

Once this is done, you should be able to send any amount of ERC20 VEN from your ledger to the intermediary address, and the equivalent VET will be sent to your ledger address.",18-08-14-03-03,10,46599,BaconAndEgg,97026y

I've observed my ledger address in the mobile app but the option for the token swap isn't appearing under the 'me' tab. Any idea what could be the problem?

Where blockchain thrives, is when it comes to the point where **trust** is important.

11942,"Correct. However, lets look at an optimal use of blockchain.

Sushi is being shipped, and it is tagged with a rfid chip that maps 1 to 1 with the sushi and the blockchain (think a serial number.) This rfid automatically writes to the chain whenever it detects the temperature drops below a safe threshold for shipping sushi. The truck carrying the sushi is destined for a sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. On the way. The truck breaks down and the sushi is exposed to 120F degree temperatures. The RFID chip registers this and writes it to the chain saying the sushi is now bad. The truck gets repaired, refrigeration kicks on and the sushi is cooled again. The truck driver also happens to be a computer chip wizard, and he's able to hack the RFID chip and have it send data to the blockchain about the new temperature. Now there are two logs written to the chain about that specific package of sushi. One log says the sushi went bad. One log says the sushi is good again. 

When the driver drops off the sushi, it gets scanned in. The person scanning in the sushi checks the logs and sees that one log said the sushi went bad. Even though the driver was able to add a new log, it doesn't matter. The first log wasn't overwritten, simply a new one was added and the scanner will know the sushi is not good anymore.

Waltonchain does not write data directly to the blockchain through their RFIDs. No matter what the moon boys tell you that isn't a true statement. It is proven false in AMAs and the white paper itself. 

In fact, BOTH waltonchain and vechain write the block-hash to the RFID chip at the end of manufacturing before a human even interacts with the chip. Why? Because it's not hard and such things could have been done more than a decade ago. 

There is nothing unique about Waltonchain's claim here and them saying they are ""first"" is ignorant or a lie. VeChain has been doing this for three years under BitSE well before Waltonchain was even an idea, ico, or company. ",18-02-19-07-49,6,7067,JoshuaSP,7yh82z

While marketing does make all the difference for FMCG, Food and Beverage and even Fashion and Apparel companies but that’s because they are fairly low tech and derive higher profits from their processes than their technology. It does not take much for a competitor to make a comparable product of equal or higher quality because the raw material in most cases are universally available and the technology required to produce these products is readily available. 

Marketing has failed many times when it comes to technology products. Take Bing and Yahoo for example. I am sure Microsoft has a huge marketing budget but they were still not able to trump Google because their product was inferior. Similarly there have been a ton of companies that have tried producing electric cars for example and have all failed miserably and I am talking about well established players like Honda and General Motors. A company like Tesla won that race (pun intended) because they had sound marketing ON TOP of great tech, not the other way around. ",18-02-19-07-49,6,241,ohthataswell,7yh82z

You should look into it more as Walton has described what the patent entails briefly. Anyways both are good holds but walton clearly has better tech for what its worth which is more favorable in the eyes of the corporations that will actually use this technology. I constantly hear about how vechains marketing is the best so therefore its superior but this is an entirely false premise. Business dont give a fuck about marketing and the only thing it has been good for is to bring in more speculators that wont even use the end product. Businesses only care about the solution and service that it will provide and in some aspects vechain will suffice but for others they will need to rely on a more robust and sound technology that waltonchain provides.

VeChain recognizes that the overhead of being elite at both is intensive and VeChain already has more employees than Silicon+WTC. VeChain has partnered with some of the worlds absolute best RFiD innovation and manufacturing companies that are using VeChain in their core products and building product custom fit for the blockchain. If you think a start up like Silitec or Silicon can compare you are out of your depth in IC R&D.  WaltonChain claims to be the masters of everything while systematically being good at nothing. Their wallet is a fork of MEW in walton skin, their child chain concept isn’t unique, and their rfid chips are still stuck in the 80s.

12046,"Google replaced several search engines which already existed. Google did not have a marketing team. Google did it because of fantastic tech, not marketing. Once they gained market dominance, they did not stop innovating, at least not in the areas of search. Bing was never as good as Google and that is why it failed (although I agree that it became significantly better over time but by then it was too late). 

In fact, when Google Chrome came out, there was barely any marketing but it still ate into IE’s market share because of superior tech. 

Apple had almost rolled over when iPod came out. While there were many other music players at the time, Apple’s technology was miles ahead of everyone else. Sony and others had giant marketing budgets for their music players but they failed because iPod solved a problem using superior technology. 

Electric cars that came out in the 90s were cumbersome beasts not your nifty electric cars of today that go 100 miles on a single charge. Tesla overtook them because they made really usable electric cars. 

My point is that while marketing does play an important role in making a product successful, in the tech world it does not matter. You could be a market leader like Blackberry and get wiped out by the iPhone NOT because iPhone had better marketing but because iPhone was really really usable. It had superior tech that no one else had at the time. Apple packaged it better than everyone else and that is where your marketing logic is true but the fact remains that Apple’s tech was mind blowing. 

Unless a company has superior tech, it does not matter what your marketing is in most cases. Now I agree that some products have failed despite good tech, however in the case of technology products, it’s either success or failure because people could drink two different beers and still be ok and it’s very very hard to come up with better beer.

The theme for THOR is “Power to the People”, we want to empower EVERYONE within our community as much as possible. We would also like to try our best to distribute the Foundation generated rewards to as many people who make up the community as possible.
For this reason, the Foundation has decided that the wallets holding 1 million VET and above, require you to contribute the VeChain community in various ways before we deem you a qualified Mjolnir Masternode to receive Foundation allocated rewards. Details will be released prior to mainnet launch.
Otherwise, the THOR Power generated by those wallets will be donated back to the Foundation’s THOR Power Pool and distributed to other VET holders.",18-05-11-14-41,2,2339,hungryforitalianfood,8il5qe

do i have to be an x node holder to get the 1%? someone explain please ",18-07-27-02-55,1,242,alikon,923zx7
12309,"The 1% bonus applies to your total VET Balance.

But if you would have an X Node w/ 1,200,000 VET you would be better off leaving 600k in your Xnode to get 6k (10,5k) from the 1(,75)% and  generating 12 more wallets apart from your X Node and put 50k in each for the Lucky Draw. It would be recommendable to have a different last digit/letter for each wallet, because you would thus win almost every time. 

Here's the math: 

1) Leaving the whole 1,2M VET in your X Node: 1,200,000 \* 1,75% = 21,000 VET

2) Having a total of 13 different wallet endings: 13 / 16 = 0.8125, which means you have a 81,25% chance of winning every day (16 because there are only 16 different possibilities for the last digit: 0-9 and A-F). 

81,25% Chance of winning every day, 35 Lucky Draws left: 81,25% \* 35 = 28,44, which means according to the math you would win about 28 times. 

Let's say you are unlucky and only win 25 times: 25 \* 1,000 + 600,000 \* 1,75% (from the X Node Bonus) = 35,500 VET

One problem I've seen people have with this is they forget that the VTHOR generation rate is flexible.  Who needs a bonus pool if you are generating a bunch of VTHOR?  Will the generation rate be 2x, 3x, 4x the guaranteed minimum in 2 years? VeChain has stated the purpose of the economic node bonus pool is to kick start the 2 token economy and make sure there is enough VTHOR being generated to initiate a stable market right away.

The other problem people are having with this is understanding just how this economic model functions in the broader sense.  VeChain needs to make sure they pay enough incentive to have people lock their tokens up and generate VTHOR.  What ROI will this be?  We aren't sure.  But I can tell you that the stock market's historical average is about 9.8% per year.  If my capital isn't getting 9% or more I'll be looking elsewhere.  Keep in mind this is ""capital"", not my initial investment.  If VET reaches $100 per token and I hold 1,000 tokens then I would expect $10,000 per year from my VTHOR generation.

The conversion and communication with the smart contract will be handled by their new wallet software, to make it simple, but the underlying technique would let VEN/VET coexisting for a time, so people have time to switch over.

The only other way to do it would be if they simply use a snapshot of all the addresses at a particular time and give those addresses VET on the new chain.

I know the difference between private vs public blockchain but I have yet to hear a great example as to why the public will be preferred over the private. In my opinion it will need to be the voice of the people, of the consumers, that will have to push companies and demand the use of public blockchains where every transaction is public knowledge. 

If there is not this nascent demand then I don't see why a company wouldn't just use a private blockchain like IBM's for their own internal use for supply chain efficiency, much like companies currently use SAP for supply chain use but on their own private intranets. It remains to be seen if the consumer will demand that they themselves want to scan and verify the product they are purchasing or if the consumers will be ok purchasing a product from a company that publicly states they are using blockchain to verify their products and simply taking the company's word for it. 

For instance, currently people want to purchase anything and everything with an ""organic"" label but how many people demand to see proof the product is ""organic"". However, the third industrial revolution is just beginning and will be centered around a transparent, sharing economy. So I believe the mindset of the public will eventually shift to full and compete transparency but it remains to be seen how much demand there is for it currently. I am excited to see how this plays out as I believe if anyone is going to convince the world that public blockchains are the future, it'll be Vechain at the helm.

12593,"In terms of Private and Public blockchain, I think there is room for both. There are certain B2B information that businesses wont want on a public chain and certain (largely B2C) use cases that will make a private blockchain redundant.

Will hyperledger be the leading private chain though? I doubt.  It is doing too many things at once, a stable coin with Stellar, cross boarder payment settlements and supply chain? . ""IBM is a dinosaur"" is a phrase I often hear from people in the tech industry, and to me this feels like an attempt to stay relevant, throwing darts blindfolded and hoping something sticks.

A HK listed jeweller in Asia is using Everledger which is powered by IBM to verify their diamonds. During a recent visit I asked them how can I be sure the information on their ledger is accurate (trying to fish for information if this was powered by Vechain then) .

12661,"IBM is creating a private Blockchain, essentially a database with special access for multiple parties. 
It’s very different to the open Blockchain VeChain is building, who, as I’m sure you’re aware already have the backing of behemoths like DNVGL, PwC, the China/Indonesian government/BMW/DB Schenker/Kheune and Nagel/Bright Foods.. I could go on. Their known clientele currently exceed $300 billion in revenue. And those are just the ones we know of currently.

Sunny began VeChain as a private Blockchain in 2015 but soon realised its pitfalls, hence his move to a public blockchain. And by the way, it’s not just a supply chain coin - this is a common misconception. They are providing a holistic service - BaaS (Blockchain as a service) an all in one,’one stop solution for any and all enterprise Blockchain needs - smart contracts/supply chain as well as being a platform for their Fortune 500 partners to launch DApps and ICOs - entirely new business projects that all lend value to the platform at large. Something a private Blockchain can not achieve. It seems as though you don’t quite grasp the scope of VeChain. It is breaking brand new territory - the first application of Blockchain to the business world. It has tremendous value potential, far, far in excess of what an IBM stock may be able to offer (but bare in mind many massive companies are creating private blockchains right now, so IBM’s may not even thrive itself, don’t forget).

There is much more value in a public Blockchain - for instance with DNVGL as an example, the mass aggregation of data from various companies that use their services - oil, gas, shipping and cargo, renewables etc.. all this data can be pooled in an open Blockchain and they have such a medium called ‘Veracity’, this data can be aggregated and used in tandem with AI and IOT to create potent technological tools for forecasting and better technical understanding of a particular rock strata during drilling, for example, due to one of their clients uniquely having that data (which is usually housed on a server and kept privately - much like a private Blockchain, only a private Blockchain just has more connected private servers). 

Private blockchains are essentially intranets, and I’m sure the difference in value and data transfer between an intranet and the internet are all too obvious. So, with all due respect, it isn’t really a choice between IBM or VeChain, because they’re fundamentally different beasts. I mean, you are clearly making the comparison, but for reasons it looks like you don’t fully understand.

Open Blockchain (with a semi-centralised governance structure) will rule. Like I said - intranets VS internet. The winner will be obvious. 

And to answer some final points - they create bespoke solutions for companies to integrate VeChain with their current software solutions, and with success. This has been covered a while back. Interoperability is a big focus of theirs going forward and they’re hiring 100 new engineers this year to ensure everything consistently operates as planned. A major thing to consider is that they have the China government pushing them onward, already giving them four contracts. For example, they are building digital infrastructure in Gui’An, a new Chinese smart city - if it is a success (which is has already proven to be), it will be rolled out nationwide. This is absolutely huge! 

Also, their stack of patents is ridiculous and you should look up NDCode, a micro crystal that can store information so assets can be tokenised (like fine art, without visually impairing the product) or to prove verification of documents like money, or government files - a huge problem in countries rife with corruption. They’ve even patented a payment system so an end user can use a service on a DApp (like DNVGL’s ‘MyStory’), and an intermediary pays the cost of transacting on the  Blockchain and thus, Blockchain mass adoption is born without society ever realising. 

In my opinion, your view of what IBM and VeChain are offering is completely wrong. You do what you think it right, but your wallet will be saddened at the lost opportunity in the years to come. ",18-07-19-02-22,30,1660,Crypto-knowdeway,8zwxqx

Reading through recent posts, it seems the general consensus is that the price fluctuations of VTHO will not be significant or hinder the team, as they can maintain a stable transaction cost by simply changing the amount of VTHO required to transact.

If you proceed with the mobile wallet now, your x-node will be tied to the VeChain address associated with the mobile wallet. I'm not saying that transferring it to Ledger afterwards will not be possible, but at this point, we just don't know how/if this will work.

My plan is to wait for Ledger support and expect that I will send 0.01VEN to the intermediary address generated by the Ledger app. Next, I will probably send all my VEN to Binance and have them convert it to VET, then I will transfer my VET to the Vechain address (***not*** the  intermediary address) on my Ledger .",18-07-18-01-11,6,1407,iftodaywasurlastday,8zlxwx

12863,"According to the new AMA, X node binding is only available on the mobile wallet, I'm not sure if the Ledger app will be creating the intermediary address. I think we need to create the ledger wallet address once available, use the observe wallet function in the mobile wallet, and then do the binding process through the mobile app. From there you can still send the rest to Binance and then to the new ledger address which is what I think I will end up doing.

12865,"Binding is required for everyone. VET will be on the new Vechain blockchain. ERC20 Ven will be on the Ethereum blockchain. You have to link the old blockchain and the new one if you want to transfer to the new blockchain. 

Here is my take on what will happen. Once the ledger app comes out create a wallet using the ledger app. In the Vechain mobile wallet import this as an observable address. Then do the binding in the Vechain mobile wallet (same as everyone) After you have bound your adresses send .01 Ven as a test to the intermediary address (after token swap service has started) and see that you get 1 VET.

12872,It took a bit of reading to figure it out myself. They are using the intermediary address for both X node binding and the token swap but at different times so it’s a bit confusing. If you don’t have an X node then you have 3 weeks after the Xnode binding is finished to do the swap. I think everyone should get compensated for VTHO while the monitoring was paused.

Review how long and hard the Nano (raiblocks) beating was and expect that to be your future. If VeChain is worth its salt, the beating should be for around that long, and it should start to rise again after that. 

Guessing off my arse I would probably guess that it will drop to 2.50, it will probably drop down to the price I bought it for, and my Nano also dropped down to around the price I bought it for.

That's just the way it goes. Whenever I find out about something and buy it, the price will drop down to around to what I initially bought it for. I missed selling at the high point with nano but did not with VeChain.

Once it gets down below 2.80 or so I'm going to start buying up a lot of VeChain because the price will explode soon after that.

I tend to make great predictions but generally share them only with family. If you disagree well I'm not the one holding the bags right now and all my money is in the nano rocket, as opposed to the Vechain anchor. ",18-03-03-16-22,-6,7224,0_-,81n5wy

If you are worry about the price try to see the bigger picture. OceanEx and BitOcean ATM will greatly help Vechain keep moving forward. People selling VTHO to buy more VET is another factor that will benefit the price greatly. In you truly believe in Vechain keep buying the red days using money that you wont need.

all I'm saying is that keeping your X-node for a while longer may make it more attractive for future buyers, especially those with fat stacks (5 million +) who want to increase their ROI. In that case, you could - in the future - make more off of your X-node than you would by selling now. Of course, just how much you'd be able to make is debatable. It depends on the distribution of X-nodes in a few years, and what kind of additional privileges (if any) there will be.

All in all, there is no right or wrong. We are basing on decisions a lot on speculation at this point.

So the price of an X-node will really depend on how rare it becomes and how attractive its associated benefits are. Don't forget: By then, many X-node holders will not want to part with their X status so there probably won't be too much selling pressure. Instead, buyers would be scouting for the best possible price and may very well be willing to pay a significant premium if it aligns with their ambitions. 

Also, it does not matter if VET is at 1$, 2$, 4$, or 10 cents. The logic is the same. An X-Mjolnir will have the benefit of a much higher ROI than its regular counterpart = more passive income. ",18-12-12-05-41,8,2281,snajm01,a59lbw

So what if VET didn't drop in price and was at 5c now post split.  Would they be idiots for selling the node for a million VET ($50k) then? The amount of VTHO being generated didn't change at all so really the value of an x node relative to VET should stay pretty similar. Anyone, whether you currently hold an x node or not, needs to look at this from the point of view of an unbiased investor.... Do the benefits of an x node outweigh the number of VET it's selling for?

13274,"First... What is up with people downvoting every single post / comment? Get a life! There's a world outside Reddit where you can be just as equally aggressive and awkward.   


Now to your point: 

That's why I used the Mjolnir node as an example; for other nodes down the hierarchy, it becomes less attractive to pay a lot for an x-node because the ROI incentive may not be too high. Of course, this will also depend on prospective X-node advantages. 

To give you a clear example... 

Say VET is at 1$. 

A holder has 20,000,000 VET, therefore 20,000,000$

A 1% difference in ROI means $200,000 more income **PER YEAR.** This is not a one-time thing, remember that. 

So, practically, the holder would be willing to spend millions of VET / $ to get this kind of additional return. For example, he/she would probably not mind paying 2,000,000 VET / $ for that privilege, probably (logically) even more.

Now that's out of the way, I know adoption of disruptive tech can take a while; most of us do. But there is no justification for the over-hyping by VeChain. Litterally everything they published appeared to be much much less impressive. Some examples:

* BMW partnership. ""The rumor is true."" Appeared to be nothing more than acceptance in their startup garage programme and a related purchase order so they could refer to BMW Group as their client. 
* ""In a way imagine a dapp platform but thousands of dapps and ICO projects led by or designed by FORTUNE 500 companies."" (Sunny) We've seen a handful of ICO's, none of them by a multinational company and no new ICO since August. 
* ""With trillions of expected transactions..."" (VeChain Foundation on Medium) We would need about 100.000.000 days with current mainnet usage to achieve the trillions of transactions milestone. Are we even slightly on schedule 5 months after launch? 
* ""Our solutions are already being used by companies NOW, as we speak. VeChain has already built a standalone consortium chain that these clients are running on, a permissioned blockchain. All these clients will be migrated to the VeChainThor public blockchain when it’s launched."" (VeChain AMA) Now 5 months after mainnet launch.. deafening silence. 
* ""Ideally, most of the VTHO tokens generated would be spent to pay for transactions on VeChain."" (whitepaper) What percentage of the generated VTHO are being spent on transactions? We couldn't be further from their ideal situation which is not a good sign.
* ""Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus protocol suiting the need governance setting so that there would not be anonymous block producers, but 101 known validators (Authority Masternodes) authorized by the VeChain Foundation and VeChain community."" (whitepaper) Fact is that VeChain still holds AM's because of a lack of interest. By the way, these are **anonymous** block producers and **not** authorized by VeChain community.

Occupying a seat on the steering committee that acts as the governing body of the VeChain project, PwC is a major shareholder and key figure in enabling VeChain to leverage resources in the broader industry. The second largest professional services firm and described as the most prestigious accounting firm globally, PwC is widely recognized in the business world and lends the VeChain brand legitimacy and far-reaching influence that would not be possible without the likes of such a significant partner.

Renault and BYD

Some global automotive manufacturers, Renault and BYD (the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, based in China) have partnered with VeChain with the goal of implementing its maintenance passport solution to record maintenance records. The blockchain technology will be used for the tracking of maintenance, repairs, brake wear, odometer readings, and even driving habits, making it far easier to be assured of the quality and maintenance of automotive products.

VeChain, DNV GL and BYD have also teamed up to initiate a Carbon Credits project. This solution to carbon pollution rewards vehicle operators with credits based on their vehicles’ driving performance and emission reduction. The program provides the tools necessary to construct a blockchain-based ecosystem aimed at reducing the global carbon footprint. Each footprint captured will be recorded on the VeChainThor Blockchain and made available to clients interested in participating in the initiative. The rewarded credits can then be used as a form of payment for insurance as well as to purchase everyday needs such as food from participating stores. For example, credits can be obtained by driving electric vehicles manufactured by BYD and products can then be purchased from Bright Food with the earned credits.

DNV GL

You may not have heard of this entity, but it plays an important role in providing risk assurance and quality assurance services. the global supply chain of goods. Acting as a certification-issuer, DNV GL ensures transparency and traceability of a wide range of products, from initial production to the point of purchase. Ensuring that procedures are followed in production and that standards are maintained throughout a product’s fabrication and distribution, DNV GL will now harness VeChain technology to aid in this process. This is a perfect partnership for VeChain as the two entities seek to serve the same need, now made more efficient and trustworthy via blockchain and IoT technology.

Chinese Government

Few could imagine a larger partnership than one with multiple governing bodies in China. VeChain is working with certain departments in a national level new area named Gui’an New Area to improve efficiencies, reducing barriers and redundancies between disparate departments and bureaus. CMO Noah Huo gives a simple example: the currently slow and complicated process of opening a new restaurant business. This normally requires multiple submissions of documentation to numerous governing bodies, often redundant and slow to be processed. With VeChain’s technology, it is instead possible to submit the documentation once, assure its authenticity, accuracy and completeness, and share it quickly to multiple governing bodies.

VeChain has also worked closely with governing bodies in Shanghai for the purposes of wine product traceability. Within the free trade zone, Shanghai imports goods from around the world and is a key location in the global supply chain that feeds into China’s economy. VeChain is also working with the city of Shanghai as a testing zone, with the goal of assisting in the process of product imports such as wine and luxury goods, for example.

The aforementioned carbon credit program, in cooperation with BYD, is also in the initial stages and will likely see cooperation with Chinese governing authorities in the future.

Cyprus

Another partnership at the national level, VeChain and Cyprus have signed a Memorandum of Agreement to utilize the blockchain on a broad scale in the country. Although CMO Noah Huo says not much can be disclosed, he did share a few details regarding this agreement. VeChain and partner CREAM seek to help Cyprus make a transition into the digital age via a digital transformation of the economy and its governance.

Leveraging lessons learned from the highly digitized lives of Chinese citizenry, who rarely use cash for any monetary transaction, instead relying on mobiles and digital interactions, VeChain will apply these principles in aiding the Cyprus government to leapfrog into an age of digital transformation. Without sharing too many details, VeChain would be used in Cyprus, Huo explained, to integrate technology at the infrastructure level, particularly in the FinTech industry, government affairs, and in finances.

Long term / over time it's possible to keep price down.

13516,"VET is not supposed to be the stable part.

Thor is.

Buying VET would be like buying a building as a long term investment, and as less buildings(VET) are available the price goes up.

Buying Thor is like renting a building in that you only pay for what you need, and the price doesn't change much as landlords(VET holders) can lease more rooms(sell more Thor) keeping the price stable.

VET is used in ICOs for raising funds, then the new projects lock up their VET making it scarce, so this price will increase. Thor is used for the transactions and operations on the chain so if it becomes scarce then Vechain can ramp up the production (increasing the supply) and the price drops and stabilizes.

This is one of the weaknesses with other crypto platforms such as ethereum - as the platform gets more use and price goes up, the cost to use the platform goes up as well. 

The whitepaper actually discusses this. Vechain wants their enterprise clients to be able to estimate the cost of using the platform for the next 6 months at a time. Gas is the cost of using the platform, and it's calculated by a formula. This formula factors in the generation rate of VTHO, so this can be adjusted to keep the gas cost stable regardless of VTHO's price",18-05-30-23-53,10,19060,Tiaan,8n8qrd

VET has the ability to be staked on the mobile wallet/binance and make you a small side profit. 

Suppose VET dips further to 1 cent, i still make the same amount of vtho despite price. And i can sell that vtho to off set my initial investment loss. 

Suppose VET dips to 1 cent and stays there for life. Again, im making a side profit, I will eventually make my money back. This is just the dynamics of owning a coin that can be staked.

VTHO has no consumptive demand, yet. And therefore, there is no expectation for prices to go up. Most people here arrived during the bull run of 2017 and dont understand that it was provoked by speculative investment only. Investing in VeChain is acknowledging the real life potential of consumptive demand providing an increase in valuation over time. If you're not comfortable with this price, you need to shut your computer off. 

VET is one of the few projects out there that actually has a concrete roadmap to onboard clients which in-turn will create that consumptive demand of VTHO and as a result, increase the value of VET.

We are just given the same opportunity to invest in the token to keep things decentralized. The current market price is based just as much on enterprise demand, which is being on-boarded and marketed as we speak. And new enterprises can acquire their nodes for pretty fair prices based on their transactional volumes. We're talking $15k for the minimum node and about $300k for the larger partners.  The economics make sense from a business perspective. 

Eventually, more and more businesses will determine use cases and the network will grow quickly over time. Now, we're sitting on a large volume of tps, everyone generating vtho to increase their ""equity"" in VET or using it to pay for transactions, and the value of VET and VTHO increase accordingly.

I'm down on my investment by a noticeable little chunk, but I honestly can remain calm about it. It's an investment based on what I just speculated and I think it's a good one at that.

I own a lot of coins. 
VET is a very minority holding. 
I'm not playing victim - I am trying to help as many as I can not make the same mistake. I am not blaming anyone, I like the project.
Some people might not have time or the investment to keep on top of a token exchange for such a minority holding. 
A lot of you by your comments are heavily invested as a holding in your portfolios. Defence of a coin is fine.
I would hope a community engendered in the success of a project might continue to support trying to promote the correct methodology of holding.

The reason this mistake was made was the very first search on Google for `VET Wallet' was a link to the following webpage:

https://www.finder.com/uk/best-vechain-wallets

An observation for the sticky would be to put in clear writing at the very top that this is no longer an erc20 coin and is now on its own chain. Perhaps then it would stop idiots like me who went to the first webpage they found in a google search for 'VET wallet' to confirm what I thought I already knew. 

Edit: I'd also like to say that the excerpt from the sticky quoted is really not clear if you can abstract yourself from any existing investment in reading up on the coin. Anyone has the potential to interpret the words and structure incorrectly if you re-read. I would suggest a clear statement at the top of the sticky rather than a few words that can easily be misinterpreted.

Out of all the projects out there VeChain is the closest to being adopted in the real world and their tech is already working.

\- It is a Smart Contracts Platform

\- Proof of Authority (ID)...approx 101 Trusted nodes (much more than NEO or EOS)

\- Set up in one of the world's most  Innovative & Technologically Advanced countries : Singapore

\- Government/Regulations Compliant, working with banks and Governments

\- Has support of Chinese Govenment for projects (eg. Gui'an (Guiyang) Smart City Project)

\- Pays Dividens as VTho tokens

\- Great tech: RFID, ""NDCode"" nanotech tags for supply chain (NDCODE is AMAZING TECH!!!)

TPS is capped initially, but by design Vechain is able to scale up to 10k TPS.

14026,"I had this discussion with the SONM CTO Igor and he told me this:

“Lets do some math on blockchain growth:
- lets say a typical TX will have AT LEAST (for the simplest imaginable transaction of Ether sending):

— from (20 bytes)

— to (20 bytes)

— value (int 256, 32 bytes)

— some other info, lets say 10 bytes

— if it is a ERC20 token transfer it will also have smart contract address, another 20 bytes

- it gives us 82 bytes, lets round to 100 bytes per TX (keeping in mind ERC20 variation). So 100 bytes per TX, on the bottom, could be more!
- So you say 10k TPS.
- There is roughly 31M seconds per yer. (60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = 31 536 000)
- That gives us 10k x 31M = 310G TX per year. Each at least 100 bytes.
- That gives us 310G x 100 = 31T of data per year. 31 terabytes per year.

This is far ahead the capabilities of a typical PC with RAID, and even far ahead of typical rented servers.
Only storing data of this will require specialized storage systems, actually we are talking about a 100T-class storage system, which may cost 10k-20k USD.

But it is not only about storing a blockchain of this size.
Blockchain of this size will ultimateley produce a STATE DB of a comparable size (10-100T). A relational DB of such size is complex and will have HUGE performance issues if ever work.
At least it is not obvious how a state DB will operate at that scale of data.
I mean there ARE some databases in the world of such size, but it is not a mainstream task and scale, and obviously it requires COMPLEX design and maintenance, far far more work, then just to “install a masternode”.

So, after all, I doubt that it was tested and anyone even imagine, how a blockchain will work at 10k TPS. It sounds like a dream.”",18-09-02-18-16,4,24,CryptoHunter2018,9calnp

Authority Node holders are VETTED (\*rimshot\*) to be competent entities (mostly enterprises) that should be able to handle it both technically and from a cost-perspective.

In a blockchain you are largely just storing hashes of data that act as keys in other value stores, it isn't like you are doing complicated multi-table joins or anything. The old data is far less regularly accessed and only used for verification/audit purposes.

It is important to note also that authority nodes are random people off the street who feel like spinning up a node. There are only 101 of them, and if we actually do hit 10k TPS, they will be making PLENTY of money from VTHO rewards to pay for any hardware they need.",18-09-02-18-16,1,38,wowDarklord,9calnp

14116,I bound the x node via the ledger and completed the token swap with the mobile wallet. So currently my tokens are in the vechain app wallet.

14117,"So you have 2 addresses, one on your ledger, one in your mobile wallet. The one on your ledger is empty but has the X-node bound to it and the one on your mobile wallet contains at least 600k Vet. This is correct right? Just to make sure we understand you correctly.

You can move your Vet from the mobile wallet address to your ledger address. You have to do this before the 1st of september. Then the monitoring of the X-nodes starts again and if any X wallet doesn't contain enough Vet the X-node will be lost. 

Also, there are no bonus thor X-rewards payed out yet. They will start from the 1st of september. 

You can use the mobile wallet to observe your ledger address. This means you cannot transact from the mobile wallet but you can see the amount of Vet you have and the amount of Thor you get with each block.

That would require 4.6M VET (less with bonuses included), so around 90k USD to buy.
On the other hand buying that VTHO even at current inflated prices would cost 21k a year.

Then you need to handle VET in a wallet, etc. For a smaller company it could be better to just buy the VTHO, especially at first until they don't know how the market moves (VET could crash and they lose their investment).

The price of VET will rise to a level commensurate with the return on investment gained by producing Thor.

Then the next year more businesses are signed and more transactions added, raising demand for Thor and increasing the price to $10.  The returns my VET earn me have doubled and so if someone else wants to buy my VET so they can earn the Thor money, I'm not going to sell it to them for the same price I would have sold at when it only earned me half the money, am I?

Basically what they did was programmed the VW to activate emission controls only during laboratory testing. So with a permanent censor installed they'd have to program the VW to constantly have their emission controls activated to beat the tests and what would that mean for VW you genius? Yes that would mean emission controls would be activated permanently and they would be fully compliant with emission laws.

14414,Waiting to do the swap directly in the wallet is an option yes. But Binance had an option to swap your tokens but you cannot swap there anymore they only had a limited window to do it. Lbank had a continuous token swap going on and you more than likely can still do the swap there but you should check first of course. Kucoin did a token swap as well but I am not aware of how it was orchestrated and whether it was similar to Binance or Lbank. There's not much benefit left to doing the swap (The biggest incentive was a last minute Early Bird reward program for X Node holders along with a VTHO airdrop at Binance for any VET holders) so you easily could wait til the 10th unless you wanted to start generating VTHO in the mobile wallet sooner than later.

14433,"So here is what I sent to the VeChain Foundation. I think it goes into a little more detail.

"" Hello, I am in a bit of a dilemma regarding the VeChainThor X-Node binding. First of all, I have held slightly over 6,000 VEN on my Leger's MEW address since the first snaphot back in March. But now with the binding deadline coming up, I am actually trying to make it official in order to keep my X-node status. So I watched the official informational video on YouTube on how to bind my address. I went through the process of making a new wallet on the VeChainThor app. Then the video explains that I also should import my old address that the snapshot was taken of. So I import that MEW address under the ""Observe"" function. Next, the video explains to go to the ""Rewards"" tab and click ""X Node Binding"", which I did. So then I choose the ""Observed"" MEW. Then it takes me to the page that says ""Input Ethereum VEN Wallet Address"". So I retype the same ETH address again, as it is the one that is currently my X-node, as the video states. I then click ""X-Node Verification"", and it takes me to a new screen, explaining everything with the Intermediary Address. The I click ""Understood, start binding"". So from there, it takes me to the Intermediary address page. I go to MEW on Ledger, from which I use to send 0.01 VEN to this address. After I wait for some time, I hit ""ERC20 VEN transferred, next"". After this it takes me back to the ""X-Node Binding"" page on the app, where both my new address and my ""Observed"" MEW address are displayed. My ""Observed"" address now has the little VeThor emblem next to it, apparently confirming its status. But this is where the  issue lies. I need 600k VET on that address. The address that I bonded was the Ledger's MEW, which cannot receive VET tokens.

So I'm thinking, when I went to the ""Rewards""-> ""X-Node Binding"" page, was I supposed to choose the NEW wallet I created in the VeChainThor app, ""Confirm"" it, then type in my old MEW address in the next screen instead of first choosing the ""Observed"" MEW wallet, then retyping the same address again on the next screen?

Because either way, today I tried binding the new address I had created when I downloaded the VeChainThor app. So when I went to the ""Rewards""-> ""X-Node Binding"", I chose the new address this time instead of the old Observed one. I hit confirm. SO it took me to the page where it says to type in the address of my X-Node. I type in my old address this time, the one that had the snapshot. But then it the message pops up ""Bound Ethereum Address; Your Ethereum address has already been bounded... please use another Ethereum address and try again."" So at this point I am stuck. Would I be able to unbind the ""Observed"" wallet, and if so would it remove my X- status completely? Because from what I see, apparently I had to bind my Ledger's MEW to the wallet that was made with the VeChainThor app.""

Like I said, the 500 VET will still be handed out, but once this situation is solved. Anyways, thanks a lot for all your input, I am currently working hard at this right now,

Edit: Well now I've realized what went wrong. I had to have clicked the new wallet and typed in the MEW address to bind it. Instead, I chose the MEW address and retyped it to bind it to itself apparently. I just want to unbind it from itself and bund it to the new wallet instead. If theres a way to do this without removing my X-status, that would be a huge help.",18-07-28-06-57,2,160,abominationz777,92gapf
14434,"Hi guys, I would also like to clarify that I have read the pinned guide, but there are some contradictory statements to a few things I have understood. At the bottom under ""Common Question Regarding Ledger Use"", points 1 and 2 specifically. It says I cannot keep my X-node on my Ledger, yet that is the one that was snapshotted and currently the address that is under the ""Observe"" function. #2 says that I cannot use my Observe function or something like that if I read that correctly?

14544,"The thing you don't understand is that East Asian nations all thrive under central control especially if they were still classified as a developing nation. Despite every negative thing that's been said about China by the west for the past 30 years, 800 million Chinese citizen are brought out of poverty and they now have a larger middle class than the US. The lives of the Chinese are getting better under this government, not worse. Contrast this with lives of the average Indian with their democratic government. 

The Chinese government wants to stay in power, and it wants to do so for a long time. They understand that for them to do so, it has to be accountable and answer to its citizens. There are only a handful of authoritarian governments which are accountable to their citizens in the world. China is one of them. A central one party state has lots of benefits compared to a multi party democracy as the west has finally begun to take notice in the recent years. However, it also has its flaws. 

The blockchain is a possible solution to at least dampen the effects of the flaws of the 1 party system. All government info can be stored on the blockchain with nobody being able to edit them. Fraud would be harder to conduct. The corruption going on there with luxury goods will be easily traced and identified. GDP calculation figures, pollution data, health indicators, and all sorts of data will now be uneditable. This solves a huge problem within the party. 

What you may not know about China is that they have learned a lot from the chaos of the Mao era. They now never decide on anything without first experimenting with it in a town. If it becomes successful, it is then used on a small city, then a big city, and then country wide to major cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. This is in line with Deng Xiaoping's ""Crossing the river by feeling the stones"" philosophy. This is how Special Economic Zones like Shenzhen and Shanghai's Pudong were born 30 years ago. Sounds familiar? This is what Vechain is doing in Gui'An. It's a new experimental city like today Shenzhen. In case some people do not know, Shenzhen is where most the world's electronics come from. Companies like Huawei, Tencent, DJI, Xiaomi, OPPO, and also comes from Shenzhen. 

So you can expect Vechain to be implemented country wide if the experimental city in Gui'An is a success.

14567,"I do not mean to imply that the average Chinese life has not improved since the 90s.  There are certainly benefits to having centralized power beholden to no one and they've used that perk to invest immensely in their nation, the result of which you've noted above.  I'm not trying to say that there aren't benefits to using the blockchain to store, access, and verify citizen data either and I've noted a couple in this thread.  The commercial applications speak for themselves as well and I don't see much of a downside on that front.

In spite of all of this, I still don't see the admittedly negative scenario in this post as a good thing to do on a human level regardless of whether the worst-case situation comes to fruition.  Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I think it's dehumanizing to think about your life's work boiled down into a score based on an algorithm designed to steer behavior towards the will of a ruling elite.  For all the economic gains you've noted, I would still not want to live there as part of that new middle class.  The freedoms afforded to most Western democracies can't be economically quantified.

My point is not so much that this won't be beneficial, but that such a system in the hands of a centralized authority *can be* disastrous.  What, for example, is to stop a farther-right leadership group 20 years down the road from checking the blockchain and rounding up everyone who has *ever* made a publicly dissenting comment?  Nothing, and there would be no way for a well-intentioned leader to safeguard against this in the future; the blockchain sees to that.  To me, it seems like a far more organized and transparent version of what the NSA purportedly implemented.  That system is good for intelligence agencies, but is it good for everyone else? 

I don't really mean to fear monger as much as my posts have likely implied, but I do think that it's in our best interest to think beyond profit when approaching these new technologies.   Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean that you *should* do it.

From what I've read, Waltonchain follows this model more closely and thus I am not surprised that the Chinese government has chosen VeChain as a partner for now.  The Big Brother scenario is one where the government owns and operates their own blockchain as a sort of intranet.  If the code is closed and they control all of the physical machines verifying data, what accountability fail-safe would exist?

At the end of the day, blockchain technology and the innovations on it that are sure to follow in the coming years are going to have a transformative effect on the world.  Money and economic security is obviously a factor, but the premise that it can return some power to the people is a significant factor for why I've bought in.  I know ethics and economics don't typically work well together in Capitalism, yet it doesn't mean they need to be mutually exclusive; companies can make money *and* make the world a better place at the same time.",18-01-15-03-42,2,29,Crypto_for_Altruism,7qcvg1

THOR calculator gives THOR reward based off numbers given by VeChain.

But if there are more node holders than what is estimated then the number of THOR as a reward goes down.

If people figure out a way to pool their VET and become a node then that means less THOR reward for everyone.

If everyone can pool together to hit that 150,000 VET node then the reward is spread thin and those who actually own enough VET to hit 150,000 VET on their own will see their THOR reward drop a ton as everyone can pool together to hit 150,000 VET.

Then every 6 months the THOR reward pool drops so you get a bit less.

Its a similar comparrison to an automobile manufacturer outsourcing the tires they use on their cars, vs making them themselves... very often a company is further ahead outsourcing to someone who specializes in a particular part, while they focus on making the best car. This in no way makes the automobile manufacturer less than someone who does manufacture their own tires, and often they actually produce a far greater product. 
This isnt to say wtc isnt going places too, but there is a reason some of the largest organizations in the world have united with Vechain. Do you think their main focus is on who makes one of the tools Vechain will use, or instead their ability to implement its use on global scale?

14826,"> the emotional intelligence of some people on this sub is strange, evident by down-voting relevant discussions like this one. I'd buy VET stocks in a heartbeat.   
  
Probably because ""Jim Breyer bought stock in the company, not actual VET!"" (which was not even true, he owns both) and ""I would buy stock in the private company/foundation but the token is worthless"" was the new FUD after the whitepaper was released.  And as a result of it coming up in so many conversations/threads about VET, it had become common knowledge that an average person can not, in fact, invest in the private company or the nonprofit, which is kind of common sense to begin with.   
  
But also, I don't believe there's a huge difference between owning part of the private company and owning VET anyway.  I don't believe the private company actually *does* anything that we know of, it might just be a VET holding company in a tax haven.  And if you guys are talking about investing in the foundation, I believe they do get income from developing dapps/consulting/onboarding clients, which is a good way to keep the lights on, but ultimately the goal is to grow the ecosystem and give the token more value, not build a blockchain consulting empire.  The only reason I'd invest in it over VET (if it were possible) would be if I believe the VET token is still overvalued, in which case I'd still rather wait to buy VET at a cheaper price.  
  
Now, if they had a for profit company whose goal is to ambitiously set up offices around the world in anticipation of businesses of all sizes needing to be onboarded onto the platform, sign me the fuck up.  I think there's legitimately huge potential there.

14838,"Good thing that I have a good understanding of shares and investing in general. Lol, usually people who call others fools are the most foolish. Just sayin’.  The reality is that the worlds leading nations are in sooo much debt that can’t possibly ever be paid back and the debt is snowballing.  The US gov currently spends almost as much servicing it’s debt each year as on our military, and we spend a lot of fucking money on military.  Plus, it’s projected that in the near future, we will spend more on debt.  

When the creditors realize that these funds will never be paid back, it will lead to serious issues.  Other industrialized countries are in even worse positions relative to their GDP. Fractional reserve banking and certain derivatives pose systematic risks to the worlds financial markets which are already built on a house of cards that could come tumbling down during the next financial crisis. 

It is not outside the realm of possibility to think that the worlds financial systems could crumble at some point in the next 5-20 years, leaving digital money as the only viable alternative.  fiat currency backed solely by faith in government is not necessarily sound money and it’s an experiment that may be coming to an end in the not so distant future. Historically, currencies do not have infinite staying power anyway.  

Central banks eventually get into a bind and try to take the easy way out by printing money, which can lead to hyperinflation.  Not saying it’s going to definitely happen, but it’s foolish to not realize just how precarious financial markets are.  With how global markets are so intertwined now the failure of an important currency like USD or the euro would undoubtedly set off a chain reaction of negative events that would decimate markets and most likely lead to a worldwide depression that would make the early 2000’s financial crisis seem like a small market correction.

And a big chunk of our discretionary spending goes toward the military.  

Hate to burst your bubble, but we are not taking on mountains of debt to invest in anything profitable.  You can only continue to pile on debt for so long before your creditors wise up and realize you can never pay.  Then the interest rates you have to pay for new debt increases as your risk of default increases and the cycle accelerates and the situation worsens.  Ask yourself, what does sovereign money actually mean?  It’s not like we are on the gold standard where u can actually redeem it for something tangible.  We are at the whims of central bankers tinkering with monetary policy and the longterm outlook is not good.

15120,"> SECTION 2: BASE GENERATION RATE FOR VETHOR PER VET HELD  
Taken both the cumulation of current business partner usage, VeChainThor Blockchain capacity, and the VeThor consumption of transaction executions and other factors into consideration, the base generation rate of THOR Power generation speed is mandated to be:  
0.000432 VTHO per VET per Day;
Approximately 0.15768 VeThor per VET per Year;
To generate 1 VTHO per day requires approximately 2,314.8 VET.
Please be noted that, this is the lowest VeThor base generation rate as predetermined based on the factors mentioned above. The VeChain Foundation with the help of automated algorithms from our technology team, will closely monitor the usage and status of the VeChainThor blockchain and to balance the VeChain ecosystem. At the same time, those figures and indicators will be shown in the VeChain Blockchain Explorer on a real time basis.
If needed, the Foundation shall initiate voting to re-adjust the base generation rate, and all node holders have one vote for re-adjusting the VeThor base generation rate. Detailed information will be released together with full VeChain Economic Paper upon completion.  
Considering the vital role enterprise users and smart contract owners play in our blockchain platform, and that we highly encourage them to adopt VeChainThor Blockchain and integrate it into real business use cases, the VeThor generated by a portion of VET possessed by the Foundation will be rewarded to them to facilitate the adoption and integration in the early stage.

15121,"It starts piecemeal.

An industry or portion thereof uses a new product or method which proves to be more profitable than existing (or competing) products or methods.  From there the tech spreads vertically and laterally.

It is not necessary that all actors adopt Vechain.  It is necessary that Vechain (the product and method) give a competitive advantage to those who adopt it.

If the solution really, truly works, then it's up to others to adapt or perish.  Other industries will take notice and evolve or adjust.  New regulations will require the technology.  The insurance and assurance industries will incentivize further adoption. Eventually the technology is ubiquitous.  Think seatbelts and airbags.

Companies like DNV and PWC are strong actors in this type of integration.  Try to get a couple of screws onto an oil rig in the North Atlantic without DNV's approval.  These agencies already function as gatekeepers.

15122,"You have to play by the rules or take your business elsewhere.  At my job I’m required to submit all the proper safety paperwork and follow the engineering designs and pass inspection.  Sure if I want to be a bad actor and not follow procedure I probably won’t have a job long.  Think the same applies here.  This is the procedure, this is how we are moving forward, and if it not followed well you find people that will.  Computers do most of the work these days and I don’t think you just slam everyone at once, baby steps and slowly integrate.  I believe once businesses see the benefits there will be a want to integrate.  Save time and money, plus mistakes along the way.  I think what it comes down to if it’s easier, less mistakes, and saves money well you do it.   I think of it like IT internet guys that setup a network at a business.  I’m sure back in the 90’s it took time to get companies on board but now every big company has a network.  Anyways my 2 cents.  ",18-06-04-07-57,4,859,jkazoo,8oc20l
15123,"I think it makes sense to harmonise software ecosystems and that’s why I think VeChain has been targeting these umbrella entities that oversee thousands of businesses. If it’s implemented as a top down approach, then it makes sense these overarching entities would push the VeChain Blockchain ecosystem, for data harmony and efficiency purposes, throughout their respective business networks making it easier than it might initially seem for the ecosystem to penetrate the smaller players. Plus, say, in the case of China - a company wishes to export wine. Well, if the exporting entity isn’t holding their producers to the same high accord by logging all steps of production on the Blockchain then China might simply reject the exported produce due to its lack of verifiable quality. Thus, it may come to pass that adopting VeChain becomes a prerequisite for business in time. Certainly in regard to supply chains, anyway. 

Once companies that adopt Blockchain begin to bare fruit in terms of reduced costs, speedier exports, the immutability and real-time nature of the data, plus higher levels of customer satisfaction (via assurance of their product’s quality), other businesses will come flocking. Vechain’s first mover advantage here can’t be overstated, and with government contracts and world leading accountancy and assurance firms behind them, there will be one obvious choice in regards to who to choose as a Baas provider.

It’s all a matter of time. Nothing to be bummed about. It will reach the roots of supply chains in time. From a cost perspective, there’s probably actually more incentive for smaller players to adopt the tech with each £\€\$ etc wasted, relatively speaking, having higher impact. Probably the easiest way to positively affect their bottom lines is jump on Blockchain train. I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened quicker than expected when money is involved. Those that don’t evolve will lose out to adopters.",18-06-04-07-57,3,19642,SolomonGrundle,8oc20l

OceanEx is playing by the current rules, and there's not any issue for folks in the US having an account - it only affected NTI/Crypto Cup participation (in the past now) and currently there's a reduced daily withdrawal limit (so if one wants to withdraw x amount, just do math to determine how many days it takes to withdraw piecemeal if need be - voila).

Don't get me wrong, am looking forward to possibly being able to KYC one day (admittedly wish could've participated in the OCE NTI) - and believe that day will eventually come - look at all of the players involved and the current landscape...there's a good reason why it's being enforced that we can only make a non-kyc account right now. It's a very good thing as things stand currently - especially when one considers the ramfications of compliant exchanges vs. non-compliant exchanges...all of which bodes very well for the future of OceanEx, VIP-180, and VeChainThor.

If anyone who reads this thinks that the arrival of BAKKT is insignificant, and ICE aren't going to protect their interests, or that they don't have the power to do something about it - think again. Thank goodness we have a community replete with folks who have critical thinking skills and are able to discern the fact that OceanEx is built to last and will thrive if/when hammer drops. Can't say that about other exchanges. Stoked about the VET/VTHO pairing - and looking forward to more...and more VIP-180 listings, fiat on/off-ramps et cetera. 

Instead of worrying about how things are or seem, encourage folks to read and figure out how things really are - embrace, know, plan accordingly, and ignore inflammatory statements like ""blacklisted"". To reiterate - am in the US, have an account, and looking forward to market-buying OCE. Misinformation will prevent people from taking advantage of this opportunity. Think the notion of blacklisting is perhaps an unintentional false dillema fallacy. Realize might just be commenting on - miffed by current US laws (""accredited"" requirements, et cetera...have already accepted the hand have been dealt...just not sure which will happen first, accredited or kyc...maybe neither...ha's....whatever though, doesn't matter - ThorBlock is in the house now) 

It's time for folks to take a hard look at their current holdings because the next bull-run (and part of the cycle that all emerging markets go through) is going to be beautiful. No more investors throwing money at just whatever for crazy gains. The good news is that the winners will win very big whenever the inevitable/next bull-run does happen. Think VET, VTHO, VeChain Foundation backed VIP-180 (including a legally compliant exchange: aka OCE) are absolutely going to be winners.  

This is not financial advice whatsoever - is output resulting from voracious reading/research, comprehension, steadfast critical analysis, and logic. Call me crazy. This is a joy to witness unfold.

15321,"Yes, it's odd. The situation with VeChain, but also with other tokens and coins, going to the Mainnet, is the (lack of) INFORMATION. Many (Asian...?!) investors from the early hours, buying VEN very cheap in September/December 2017 for $0,05 tot 0,25ct, never paid attention for their investment anymore, or at least not daily, weekly or even monthly and ARE UNAWARE of the swap situation since they did not go to either REDDIT, TELEGRAM or their own language blogs and websites to learn about their investment. 
I think the founders and teams of these coins should find a way to inform their early adapters/investors, since, after all, they owe them of believing and stepping in with VeChain early and thus supported the coin, in this case: VeChain
**EDIT:** a few days ago I read about an early investor in October 2017 who bought a couple of hundred thousand VEN (Holy Cow!) ...around $0,25ct and he ever looked back until a few days ago and he's probably not the only one as Whenlambomoon.com shows.
**EDIT2** Just to inform: I checked my own X-node holding on whenlamboom.com on a regular basis and since we binded the X-node and moved the remaining to Binance for the swap in the past few days, the X-node had left whenlambomoon.com SO..it's functions pretty well.",18-07-21-22-35,1,152,xamojamei,90ozgt

15330,"I've thought about that as well; for those of us who ARE more aware, this kind of scenario would actually be positive (fewer X-nodes, burnt tokens after swap ends, etc.).

15414,"Yeah i'm not sure that's true.  They simply don't need to hold much value to fulfill their function on the network.. Neither does VTHO.. Actually based on the token economics i read, VeChain wants VTHO to be low cost and stable.. So why anyone think it's going to shoot up in value is beyond me.  VeChain will make a lot of money, people holding the utility tokens who will never use the service they provide, not so much.  Look for things that give you equity.  If VeChain by some miracle decides to launch a security token that pays dividends i'd be much more inclined to invest.",18-10-11-01-54,2,148428,perogies,9n05yd
15415,I can't find it in the whitepaper nor the financial report. Does anyone have a source perhaps?,18-10-11-01-54,1,165,YorraD,9n05yd
15416,"You disregard the simple fact that an asset in demand with diminishing supply will gain value - the ecosystem has factors in play that will lead to a steady reduction in circulating supply - nodes, for example - around 60% of total tokens are already soft locked in nodes - of the circulating supply there are about 5B are left and a billion more have been soft locked since the stat was released on sept 1st according to VeChainstats.com

VeChain sponsored ICOs have to lock up their VET for 2 years to produce their VTHO needs - reducing supply further. They are unlikely to offload at the end of their term seeing as they will still likely require said VTHO. They also have to use any other coins as funding first.

Companies that wish to produce their own VET in the future will have to buy from the market and hold, reducing supply. Also, future individuals looking to generate VTHO will have the same impact.

Then there’s the fact it produces VTHO which gives it intrinsic value. Once the chain is properly up and running that will set a base value for VET. Add to that the fact that, over time as VTHO consumption increases, the base generation rate of VET will be increased which further increases its intrinsic value. 

There’s also speculation as with any asset and if VeChain is successful, people will buy in.

And on your VTHO related point - VTHO can be any price, this is determined by the market. It’s irrelevant what price it is - it’s the transaction cost which needs to be kept stable which can be achieved by reducing the amount of VTHO burned per transaction or by eventually increasing the amount of VTHO being generated. The foundation can not control the market price of VTHO, it’s a common misconception the price of VTHO needs to be low.

Their two token model was conceived to combat the common issue wherein the main token of an ecosystem appreciates to the point where its respective Blockchain then became too expensive because of Tx fees, as we’ve seen with BTC/ETH etc. They conceived the two token model and VTHO as a way to have an asset that can freely appreciate and be used as a medium of value transfer, to settle smart contracts and whatnot, whilst maintaining low, affordable transaction costs on the Blockchain. 

Also, there’s the multi party payment protocol which allows an intermediary to pay the Tx fee for a user of the Blockchain, meaning they never have to own or use crypto, yet still the Blockchain sees use. This allows mass adoption without anyone realising, allowing the Blockchain to gain value via its use regardless of whether VET is actually being bought via an exchange.

Part of the reason they increased total supply by 100x was because they forecast that would require them to ultimately settle transactions in fractions of VET, which makes the math harder for the end users and businesses but also indicative they expect VET to appreciate considerably. When you look at the scope of the projects objectives, it becomes quite clear the demand in tandem with diminishing supply, ability to generate and sell VTHO and speculation will all aid its appreciation.

VET will need to have value at a global scale or else the supply will make it unfeasible. Supply and demand economics will drive price as it does with any asset, so, I disagree it needs to be cheap as your initial assumptions are flawed. VET can be any value as determined by market consensus. Same with VTHO, however the latter can be carved up into smaller and smaller chunks for the same end result. Add to that, the managerial bonuses paid out after 2 years are in VET. It would be rather pointless to take VET over cash if they didn’t think they were going to receive a valuable asset.

You HAVE to bind your X node by Aug 10. Ledger support may or may not exist by then. 

You HAVE to have the minimum amount of VET for your X node tier in your X node designated bound wallet by Sept 1.  Ledger support will most likely exist by then, but maybe not.

Those are the 2 major dates to keep in mind.  Personally, if you're intent on using Ledger, I'd give Ledger until around Aug 5-7 to release VET support, and if not released by then I'd go ahead and bind my node.  You can still keep your VEN on Ledger until Sept 1, which gives Ledger more time.  if you go this route, you'll have to transfer your X node designation from your bound VET address on the mobile wallet to a new Ledger VET address (VeChain has said they will offer this functionality, thought no timeline has been confirmed).  You'll then use the mobile app swap feature to send VEN from Ledger to intermediate address (the mobile app will guide you in this process) and then VeChain will swap to VET for you and send to your VET Ledger address.

My main area of interest is the X nodes and how many will still be around, particularly X and Strength X, after even just a year. I have a feeling that if VET ends up increasing at an alarming rate, many owners of the two lower-tier X nodes will give in to the temptation of selling, forfeiting their extra rewards and increasing them to those who stick around. 

From the general consensus of the discussion topics in the last few days, I believe a lot of investors have opted to sell their other crypto holdings to reach X node status. Since many now have their eggs in one basket, that temptation to sell could become overbearing for many. I firmly believe the real winners here will be the long-term holders of Strength X and above. This will also result in the beneficial side effect of weeding out inexperienced investors, which will help the VeChain Thor platform when voting begins to take place.

15776,"I would like to know this as well.  People are running calculations on $.5 and $5 VTHO and I'm thinking the price will be much lower, say $.05. 

The one way you can estimate this is by what Sunny has said about initial transactions per second. I believe it has been stated that main net would launch with 50tps, based on actual business need.  That makes for around 4,300,000 transactions per day.  

Now, do we know that every transaction will cost one VTHO? I don't know that for sure.  What if a transaction is half a VTHO? 

EDIT: 

Based on 4,300,000 transactions a day at $.05, I personally arrive at an annual return of around 5% of today's VET price.  This is very good return IRL, but not sure if it will be good enough for crypto.  I am confident that Sunny is trying to solve the price paradox of ""we need low price to encourage use, but high price to encourage hodling.""  I know for a fact that solving this paradox is a big focus of Dr. Zhu's.  

But by backing into an annual return rate you can see that the $.05 price I've sketched out is not unreasonable.  Even if we double the annual return to 10%, it's still only a $.1 VTHO.  

This is about as far as I can get with my math.

15799,"Hey OP, 

I found Vechain after I missed the Waltonchain run up from $1 - $8 back in Q4 of 2017.

Being a low key operations management major in college, I knew supply chain and blockchain went hand in hand. So I needed to find the golden goose.

I first bought VEN on Etherdelta for $0.30ish cents. I held it for a while. It would bump to $0.40, then subsided to $0.20 for the longest time. All the while I kept reading news of partnership after partnership.

It went back to $0.40 and I knew this was legit, because, aside from the terrible marketing and poorly written English back in the day (English is not their first language), they were transparent from the beginning. They acknowledged they had poor marketing and needed development in certain areas They had a working product, they ICO’d 3 years after founding date. They had an App, a founder with extensive tech experience who lead the tech sector of Louis V in Asian markets, multiple partnerships, and rumors of BMW and Mercedes test and pilots. Plus a god damn PwC backing, only one I knew of (didn’t even grasp how huge DNV-GL was at that point in time).

I knew we had something here and later learned of the price suppression by patient whales playing the long game.

I took all my NEO and threw it on VEN at $0.40 - $0.60 (NEO was my first big gain as I bought during Antshares). In hindsight, should kept more NEO, but I wanted as much VEN as possible knowing it would pay out in a GAS-type incentive/dividend. Passive income.

One of the better crypto decisions I’ve made. Fast forward into 2018 and VEN is so valued it’s banned from the biggest reddit sub from too much shilling. 

Now it’s a platform with ICOs on the way and  with 2 national chinese partnerships and rumors of a hardware wallet coming to take on ledger and trezor.",18-02-14-04-06,37,779,l00se_g00se,7xaufs

Set me back quite a ways. Now I'm all in on Ven and Req. it's 95/5 ratio. Ven obviously the larger. I'm trading my way up. I have passed my strength node and on my way to thunder. 

Also. I never thought this was a bad decision. I can tell you what was though...not going all in on VEN when I still had over 100k. Then lost over half and then was seriously kicking my self because I could not buy VEN at stupid cheap when it dipped below $3 twice.  This is a great coin.

15960,"Let's share our math mate, here's mine:

OCE will be valued at \~$4M at the release of the platform -> 13,75% of Tokens for Community Round + 6,875% of Tokens for Private Sale (50% of their 13,75% get locked up, thus 6,875%) = 20.625% of total Tokens are going to be the circulating supply. The total valuation for all 10B OCE tokens is 15M VET, at the current price of \~0.013$ this  means the total supply will be worth \~$19,5M and the circulating supply around $4M.

Thus OceanEx, with a market cap of $4M, will be on rank \~540 at the launch. I think that after a few months, when the volume starts coming and eventually the next bull market starts, it will at least rise into the Top 200 (being moderate here). At the current situation this would mean a market cap of $22M or a 5.5x increase (not even considering the rise in global market cap when bull starts and the thus even higher requirement for top 200). Now I see this (OCE getting into top 200) happening in the coming 6 months after launch of the Exchange while I don't think VET will do 5.5x increase in the same timeframe (as it would thus be valued at $4 Billion). I'm sure the 4$B for Vet will come eventually, just not in such a short time.

Let's use cmc's definition

>Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.

CMC doesn't include privately sold coins in their circulating supply. So i'm not going to use it either.

*     1,375,000,000 OCE

**Circulating Supply**: 1,625,000,000 OCE

>Total Supply is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).

10,000,000,000 OCE

The rate you can get OCE from the ICO:

1 VET -> 7.3 OCE

**Market Cap**: (1,625,000,000 / 7.3) * (current price of vet) = ~$2,893,836

The team still owns 70% of the total supply. Overtime more and more OCE will enter the market and because we don't have the whitepaper we don't know if any of those will be locked etc. so let's just keep going what we have right now.

And then we have OCE. I didn't see any information regarding buybacks or paying their users to hodl. We have no idea how things going to work out as we don't have the whitepaper.

What i like though is that the officially supported Vechain projects will be listed here without having to wait for other exchanges or the worst where we may be forced to buy them off from shit exchange sites. 

The algorithm sharing sounds interesting but i'm curious how they gonna make it worthwhile for the creator.
If i have a successful trading algorithm the least i want is others to know. 

Cryptobento is also interesting but not unique at all.

AI security is something they keep saying like a buzz word but the truth is, every decent exchange site including Binance using AI. 
It not unique or something no one has. It's a standard nowadays. 

Also one important thing. AI needs a lot of data, needs to be fed to work properly. The more data it has the more secure it's going to be. It's act and learn based on user behaviour. As a new exchange site these data is nonexistent. The AI is just a toddler, about to make its first step. Binance on the other hand getting closer to 30 and seen some shit(hacking, API exploits, rogue behaviour) and successfully protected their user. 

Total supported coin. 5 and the upcoming ico's supported by vechain and probably many we don't know.

OceanEX is a new exchange sites. I don't see any reason why people would use this rather than binance. Maybe fiat deposits will change this but at the same time every other exchange exploding. Look at binance and coinbase.
They also said there is no relationship between OceanX and them as they are two independent entities.

In my eyes OceanEX is not must have. If i want to trade my VTHO i'm pretty sure i can create a smart contract -> get VET as payment and use binance to sell it.
I know something even better. What if u can use your VTHO as your FIAT and pay for everything? Like you would do with a credit card? There was a rumor regarding this few months ago. It can be nothing but if u ask me i see a huge potential in this. No one of them connected to OceanEX or maybe it is?

I may be very wrong on these things though. 


I went a little sideways but i wanted to share my thoughts on this. Back to math.

* **Circulating Supply**: 1,625,000,000 OCE
* **Market Cap**: ~$2,893,836
* ** **1 OCE** : ~$0.00178

Based on what i said and that its a fairy new exchange site with almost non-existent coin support. Bots also need to invade this site to trade which will take time. 
I except a stronger sell off after ICO. A little push after the white paper release(if we don't get it earlier) but if in the meantime BTC goes down, it will take everything with it.

If the bullrun starts people going to take their profit and sell to go back to btc/eth. Once the bullrun stops and start trading sideways they will buy back to alts. Once bitcoin starts going down, they will sell their alts. 

In 6months i put VET in the $0.07-0.09 range. VTHO to 0.012-0.016.
Don't forget about the reward pool decrease every 6month for non-x node holders.

Your 100,000 VET now ~$1300
In 6months it's ~$8000.
It would have generated you ~$108 in VTHO(without any node tier bonus).

Meanwhile because oceanEX needs to ""grow up"" and because of their future plans(which is probably to have FIAT support) they need to follow strong regulatory laws which will slow down everything even further.(Remember when they mentioned the japanese government being an asshole?) i only put them into the the $15,000,000-$20,000,000 range in terms of market cap with 40% of the circulating supply. Early stage which eats up most of the ""money"" hence the circulating supply. Based on this:

* **Circulating Supply**: 4,000,000,000 OCE
* **Market Cap**: ~$17,500,000
* **1 OCE** : ~$0.004375

**So after all this finally we are here.**

If you bought into the ICO for 100,000 VET you got 730,000 OCE.
In 6months VET made you ~$6700 profit vs. OCE ~$1894.

These are my thoughts, don't take it as an advice in any way. I strongly assume everything and made my decision based on my previous experience. Don't take anything as a sure thing.

I would rather put my money into VTHO than OCE as it has a higher return in my eyes. 
I'm going to set up a !Remind Me bot for ~6-8months to remind myself how wrong/right i was :D

**tl;dr** OceanEX is a new exchange. The amount of supported coin as of right now is 5.(VET, VTHO, ETH, BTC, OCE) which is nothing. AI needs massive amount of user data to work and make the exchange secure yet their main buzz word is AI like it would be something special, something no one has yet. Competition getting tougher for exchanges as binance and coinbase going forward. Next year we can except binance first decentralized exchange. This is what OceanEX should have been, a decentralized crypto exchange site. I don't see myself or my friends using OceanEX over binance. For fiat gateaways we have other exchanges to use with years of history. As i said sadly there is nothing special or unique about OceanEX. For VTHO i strongly believe we will have multiple ways to sell/use this includes (big maybe) credit cards using VTHO as currency and smart contracts to trade your VTHO for VET or any other coin. 

OceanEX is good for the foundation as they can offer their partners not just full support for their dapp but an exchange listing too without them having to worry about going through shit exchange sites or paying millions of dollar for listing. This makes vechain a very good dapp platform but this doesn't mean it will be good for everyone as liquidity is not granted.

OCE token doesn't pays dividends or have any plan to burn the supply/buy back etc. It may change with the whitepaper release or as they release more information about the token use but as of right now i don't see it as a sure financial investment. I would rather put my money into VTHO than OCE as i forecast higher return. This doesn't mean u won't get profit out of OCE at all.

For the price forecast read the last 4 sentence above tl;dr.


p.s.: If something is wrong feel free to correct me. I would hate to lose money because i missed something important. Also i will write it down once again. These are my thoughts, don't take it as an advice in any way. I strongly assume everything and made my decision based on my previous experience. Don't take anything from me as a sure thing.

15984,"For me the answer is relatively simple: the upside potential for OCE is much higher than for VET in the short-term.

Let's look at the numbers: VeChain is valued at $720M right now and OCE will be valued at \~$4M at the release of the platform (13,75% of Tokens for Community Round + 6,875% of Tokens for Private Sale (50% of their 13,75% get locked up, thus 6,875%) = 20.625% of total Tokens) - we're talking circulating supply here.

This means OceanEx will be something like rank 540 on CMC. I would say this is AT LEAST a coin that should be in the top 200 in a few months (aka after the Exchange gets some momentum and volume). For it to do so it would need to get a market cap of $22M, which means a 5.5x. Now for VET to do the same it would need to get to \~$4 **Billion** market cap. I'm not saying this is impossible and I'm sure it will happen eventually, but not in such a short timeframe. This plus the reason that I think OceanEx will be at least a decent success and thus have some good volume leads me to believe that it will outperform VET (at least in the short term = the next 3-6+ months).",18-10-02-20-30,7,255,NikCrypto,9kpgqe

16000,">What you have to understand is that VeChain has developed a way for millions and millions of people to be consuming $VTHO and pumping your bags of $VET, AND THEY WILL NEVER KNOW IT, OR BUY ANY VET OR USE AN EXCHANGE. When you really get it, it's undeniably brilliant. 

>rewrite: MPP means VeChain can contract to sell $VTHO at fixed prices to enterprises, so that the enterprises and their customers can use blockchain without having to buy $VET using an exchange or holding a private key. VeChain buys from you directly from mobile app using $OCE.


It is a bit confusing but i think what he means is this. You have VTHO in your mobile wallet. The wallet will have a function to automatically buy more VET with your VTHO. This will be done in the background on OceanEX. So your VTHO is going to OceanEX and their VET is coming to your wallet from an MPP wallet.

 On OceanEX your VTHO is bought by enterprises and their end users, nocoiners who have no idea they're using crypto. The latter is made possible by MPP where a third party can pay for the transaction. For example an enterprise could set it up so that their customers pay with fiat but the crypto backend is paid by the enterprise that has a large wallet filled with VET for that. The cost of that process could be inside the fiat payment the customer did, for example when he bought his BYD car. Or it could be that OceanEX itself will be that large wallet that can be used by enterprises to use MPP.

In short, the VTHO in your wallet is automatically sold off to large enterprises and millions of end users and you get VET in return,  without any of the parties imvolved having to register on OceanEX. I think this is all speculation unless Jason has inside knowledge.

Edit: come to think of it, when Sunny was asked about that wallet feature to automatically sell off your VTHO for VET i think he said something like it's a cool idea they'll look into it. That makes it look like they hadn't thought of all this yet.

Yes, it is fantastic that holders have the option to sell their node which they basically got for ""free"" (it wasn't free at all).

We can argue about this forever, but it will always boil down to unfortunate wording in those X-node slides back in March of 2018.

There are many of us who held onto six or seven figures worth of VeChain while it fell to almost nothing for no other reason except that we did not want to lose our one time opportunity to have an X Node. 

Furthermore, with the Nodes being available to the highest bidder, any huge company can come along and snatch one up for a couple thousand bucks and then add millions of VET to their X Node.

Except they don’t. Six months later they realize there was a ton of interest in this model and decide to make another run of 900, bringing the total up to 1,000. To make matters worse, they do it at a time when the watch market is at a low. Because of this, they can no longer price them at $60,000. Instead, they price the other 900 at $5,000 each. You’re fucked. 

I realize this analogy is nowhere near perfect, especially because VeChain a) didn’t make more X Nodes and b) isn’t profiting from the sale of Nodes.

The rich get richer without even trying, while smaller investors who actually saw VeChain's potential before anyone did are left with a sour taste in their mouths.

But noone ""knew"" there would be such a bear market, if they did, even if x nodes weren't transferable, they wouldn't have locked it up.

It remains true that you can't restore or buy back the SAME X node if it's lost, so the 'you can't buy back' statement is perfectly correct with respect to 'your X node'. But of course you can go and buy a new-to-you X node from someone else.

There was another ""on the fly"" change shortly after the VEN to VET swap where people were ""allowed"" to upgrade to another X level without a time penalty. This was explicitly stated not to be the case when we first locked up our funds. Why in the world would I have bought a Strength X Node originally if I had known I could upgrade a basic X Node later without time delay? In my mind, they have now made at least two unexpected modifications to the original agreement, both of which if were known originally would have affected my (and many others) purchase decision.  I'll say it again, I won't be surprised if they come up with yet another ""modification"" such as a way to create additional X Nodes.

Transferability was specifically mentioned. In bold even. Yes, they didn't mention anything about setting up a marketplace so I'll give you that. Setting up a marketplace for secured trades is a positive development imo. The other option is backroom dealings/OTC where you carry significant risk.

Upgrading without a time penalty was definitely irksome but no one stopped you from buying the base level and then upgrading it later on. The reason you stumped for the Strength X wasn't because you wanted to save time by not having to wait out the maturity period (which is 30 days?). It was because you thought VET was going to the moon and the Strength X was going to get you a bigger rocket.

Look, I'm not saying they shouldn't/should have told us everything that they were planning to roll out. Yes, there are things which I wished they had communicated to us earlier.

VeChain has finalized the terms of a strategic partnership with BitOcean. BitOcean is an ATM solution selling cryptocurrencies nationwide across both China and Japan.
As one of the fastest growing solution, BitOcean is one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges to become fully licensed by the Japan’s Financial Services Authority (FSA).
This government license is a major milestone towards BitOcean’s ascent to becoming one of the largest platforms with fiat/cryptocurrency trading pairs with location based ATM networks and digital exchange in the world.
VeChain special advisor, Nan Ning, who is the CEO of BitOcean China, has been instrumental in the development of VeChain’s model to make VeChain widely adoptable across governmental bodies. His experience with Bitcoin ATMs and BitOcean’s licensing with the Japan’s FSA are highly valued across the industry.
Nan Ning has worked tirelessly to drive BitOcean’s growth and his accomplishments have made him one of the most influential cryptocurrency professionals in the world. BitOcean is not only seeing a growing interest in physical ATMs but also partnerships regarding the long term strategic growth of cryptocurrencies. By selectively choosing such an intensive partnership with VeChain, as both a company and advisor, BitOcean is committing to buy and sell VET with their physical ATMs using Japanese Yen and growing VeChain alongside BitOcean’s global expansion.
As Chinese regulations become more transparent, BitOcean will also support VeChain’s development of the world’s first blockchain powered exchange as advisor. VeChain’s solution is currently designed to handle physical goods’ trading via CNY both digitally and through VeChain token in person.
We are honored to continue building the world’s first ATM powered token application ecosystem on the blockchain alongside BitOcean.

I agree you can fork a doge 2.0 of VeChain.  They will not endorse it.  Big difference.  Without an endorsement, who will invest?  I guess never underestimate dumb money... but I predict most shitforks will stay within Eth because it'll be harder to scam money without an endorsement.

They can welcome it all they want, but Ethereum as currently set up will not get enterprise usage because there is nobody that will be able to take responsibility for the implementation.  50 bucks during onboarding, xyz customer has weekly calls with VeChain on updates with project engineer/manager dedicated and paid for the task.  Responsibility to get it done falls on someone both on VeChains side & the customers side.  This system is the only way it happens because theoretically, if it fails there needs to be a fallman & the ability to fire someone if need be.  Eth has no bridge like that and no current way to implement a system of sort.

Thereby, the natural structure of the tokens lead to different audiences, and I do not think it is relevant to discuss a ""takeover"".  VeChain found market share that Eth could not reach and took advantage of it.  Maybe this market share ends up bigger than what Eth has, maybe it does not.

Right. If you created a VEN (puns) diagram of the things both Ethereum and VeChain are trying to accomplish, you would only find one circle.

But just like Target attracts more wealthy shoppers doesn't mean you can't compare it to K-mart in their business model.

Both ETH and VeChain are platform based blockchain as a solution and should be compared as such. Just because VeChain is leagues better, doesn't mean they can't or shouldn't be compared.

The problem is that the structure of VeChain & Eth is so massively different that I do not believe the VEN diagram would be a singular circle.

If company x wants to run a blockchain, as an engineer, I work with suppliers and customers.  First thing I do if I want to get a material is to contact someone in the company to see if it's the right fit (often they have several different products anyways) after identifying what general application I'm looking for.  I price around, compare specs vs. technical information they present.  

The real meat of detail comparisons (similar to what you are mentioning to what the devs would do above) would come after conversations with the appropriate people because if I am doing intercompany comparisons, I at least want to have nailed down just one product per company, ya know?  And their representatives know more about their proper product application than myself..  ymmv, but eth has no point guy to do such and would be out of consideration.

OMG is a promising coin that is worth its hype. ICX is not. 

Think about it: Korea doesn't need its own ""Eth of Korea"" because Korea doesn't censor shit like China - hence why China needs NEO. Korea can just use Ethereum.

16623,"Sure. I was kidding about the triggering part - kind of - I thought, man, yeah, that'd be nice if I had some - for a second. That's fine. Actual triggering would be seeing a pill in front of me.

If you want to PM me later on, I'd be glad to offer some moral support if you have some dark times. I'm not sure how helpful I can be if you've been a heavy user, as I wasn't a heavy user (my max was about 30 and at my heaviest I'd use maybe 2-3 times a week). If I used more I'd have these terrible hangovers in the morning. It was also costing me a fortune (was buying off darknet - which happened to be my intro to crypto) to avoid being poisoned by fentanyl. I'd ""do my research on the vendors,"" but recently I've been thinking - dead people can't leave reviews, can they? Haha. 

At my frequency of usage, quitting was not relatively difficult. I went on a camping trip with a couple of my old buddies for 7 days. None of them knew I was using, so I wasn't about to bring anything with me. I was a little nervous going (and thought about not going), but it was a decent vacation and when I got back I figured, why not stop when I got the chance. I took a firm stance and said, ""I'm done with that shit."" And that was that.

So if you're likely to suffer from acute withdrawal symptoms, I apologize - I don't have much advice to offer you.

Anyway, I actually started seeing a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and I told her, I've been clean for half a year now. It's this paradox where when I was a user I was at least happy 10% of the time. And not just happy - sometimes, it felt like I couldn't be happier, like it was the happiest I'd ever been in my life. And now -
 now I'm unhappy 100% of the time. And that's very obviously very frustrating. And she told me that even though I was lucky enough not to go through the legendary withdrawal symptoms of puking and diarrhea and a persistent feeling of near-death, I was an addict and I'm still in recovery. It takes time - and it helps to remind yourself of that.

I'm still far from done. I also have a dependency on benzos. 2mg a day. Which also is not huge but I've been on that shit for 2 years. Now coming off benzo's is a totally different beast. I'd always suffered from anxiety. Recently, I ran out of my prescription 6 days early and was too ashamed to call my doctor. I was like, 6 days...I can do this. First two days were hard. The third day, I was having a panic attack. I was desperate and went to the pharmacist to ask for an emergency refill. I was like, I don't need a full refill, can't you give me like 1 day's worth? Obviously they were like no, call your doctor or go to the ER. I managed to get through that night with the help of seroquil and sleeping pills, but the next day was even worse, and so I capitulated and texted my doctor, and she refilled my prescription that day, no problem. I thought she was going to be like, ""You awful person, blah blah blah."" I felt so awful and guilty texting her, as though it were a relapse, or as though I were manipulating her. Even though by then I was only 3 days off. I couldn't take it anymore. We addressed it later on. Now remember I'm only at 2mg a day, and I felt crippled. I can't imagine what it's like for those with a higher dependency. After that scare, I knew I needed to start thinking about tapering. So I'm going to be dealing with that now.

This is my opinion but with all users seeking to quit one should seek a compassionate psychiatrist with experience in substance abuse. Easier said than done. But you definitely don't want someone who you feel is judging you or looking down on you. I was so scared of disappointing my psychiatrist that I made myself suffer instead of seeking her help. If you don't find a medical professional you trust, you will lie to them and ultimately the whole affair will be pointless.

Also, my feeling is that when you're about to try to clean up, make sure you're ready. If you're half-hearted about it, you're probably going to relapse. Because oxy is amazing. I don't think I'd ever been in such bliss and comfort and relief. While there's a part of me that doesn't regret having experienced that, it's also important for me to think of it as an illusion of bliss and comfort and relief. The point is, in my mind there are better and worse times to quit. Make sure you're ready. But that is just my own totally baseless conjecture. Seek out medical help!

Anyway, those are my thoughts so far on the matter so far.

16661,"Here's one of my posts from another DHL thread:      
It's been 7 months since VeChain was last at DHL's APAC(publicly) and 4 months since BMW was at DHL's APAC presenting their project with VeChain(without VeChain present), so it's interesting to see VeChain being added to the wall just now.       
               
DHL/Accenture released a report on blockchain on March 12th about how blockchain can ""Give Ultimate Transparency to Every Supply Chain"" and DHL hosted VeChain at APAC 2 weeks later. 2 weeks after that, Jerome was at Accenture demoing VeChain’s tech.

DHL's Head of Innovation/VP has been extremely vocal about VeChain since March(notably, VeChain is the only crypto she has EVER mentioned) - tweeting ""Always excited to work with this #Blockchain start-up, 唯链 VeChain"" and re-tweeting ""DHL would love to work with VeChain"" and ""Perfect use case for Ven. Lost packages due to manual scanning could be a thing of the past.""

DHL's 2 largest competitors are already officially partnered with VeChain, one of which is also owned by Germany(DB Schneker), which is important as Germany also has a 21% stake in DHL(through state-owned bank KfW). DHL has expressed strong interest in blockchain with an emphasis on transparency, has been vocal about supporting VeChain, and now VeChain is the only crypto added to the wall at DHL APAC under ""Our Partners"".

16798,"No problem - it's refreshing to see someone who uses it as fuel to get better rather than getting offended, that's really the key to improving in life!

My advice is - start off with an easy to understand story.  Highlight the problems first, then present the solution.  For example, with the current system, if you buy an expensive, 2nd hand Louis Vuitton(LV) handbag - there's no way to tell it's authentic,  wasn't previously stolen, or who truly owns it.  There's no seeing the past or ""story"" of this specific handbag, and ownership can't truly be transferred.

With VeChain, a chip can be sewn into the fabric of the bag that will verify it is authentic, even if it's resold multiple times.  The full history of the handbag is available, easy to see, and can easily verify that it wasn't stolen or counterfeit.  In addition to that, ownership can easily be transferred and the bag can truly belong to someone - Louis Vuitton can launch a free, easy to use iPhone app(running on VeChain) that customers can use to easily transfer ownership for free.  Ownership transfer has a cost, but the user doesn't need to know that.  LV can use MPP to invisibly pay fees for their app, meaning everyday users have all of the benefit but none of the cost - LV handles that.  **This means VeChain can be adopted and used on a mass scale without the public even realizing they're using it, or knowing that VeChain even exists**.

For Louis Vuitton, they have the added benefit of fighting counterfeits, ensuring their goods are genuine, easy to report as stolen, and **MOST IMPORTANTLY**, will have access to deeper data of their products life-cycle, including data that wasn't previously available, such as how many are stolen, how many times the item is re-sold, how long one owner will keep it for.  Imagine how valuable that data can be to learn about their customers and improve their products.

On top of that, VeChain tech can be used to detect which clothing items have been picked up off the shelf, tried on, and put back, so companies can learn why they were put back and improve the product.

That's not even mentioning how VeChain can be used to track Medicine, Vaccines, Casino Chips, Digital Documents(which can't be duplicated on blockchain), Art, Luxury Goods, cars, land deeds, wine, physical/digital currency, Driver's licenses, loan/mortgage issuance, used in smart cities(like Gu'ian), food - such as tracking the entire lifecycle of fish to sushi and ensuring the temperature never goes over 32 degrees.  Currently, it's hard for food companies(and car companies) to track where issues arose, leading to recalls of millions of unnecessary products.  Wouldn't it be nice to have improved tracking so they can lessen those costs, as well as consumers being happy they can verify the food isn't contaminated and was properly refrigerated?

&#x200B;

And do they have partnerships?  Fuck yes they have partnerships - Chinese Government owned China Tobacco, which produces 42% of the cigarettes in the entire world.  How about BMW?  Renault?  DNV GL, the world's largest renewable energy consultancy agency, has gone as far as buying a minority stake in VeChain, and so has PwC, one of the Big 4 accounting firm that works with 422 of the Fortune 500.  How about PICC, which insures 34% of China's insurance market(might be casualty insurance, can't remember), or the Shanghai Wine & Liquor alliance, which handles 30% of all of the wine/liquor shipped in China.  How about 2 out of 3 of the world's largest freight forwarders, with VeChain just being added to DHL's APIC center's wall yesterday?(If they officially partner with DHL, it will be 3 out of 3).  How about the world's largest electric car manufacturer, BYD?  Or DB Schneker, which is 100% owned by the government of Germany?  Or how Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is using VeChain to track government documents?  And how VeChain is mandated to be integrated in China's new Silicon Valley smart city, Gu'ian, in addition to their other Chinese entity partnerships.  Or Yida group, China's 7th largest real estate development, or Fanghuwang, who used VeChain to cut down financial loan issuance times by 75% and reduce cost by 70%?

And, the best part is, if you own VET, you essentially(indirectly) receive passive income from a portion of all of the transactions - the more the network is used, the more you earn\[VTHO\], in addition to VET appreciating in price.  The simplest way I describe this to people is it's like owning a gas station which generates gas passively, which is required to fuel the network(and bought by enterprises).  All of this for a network which has a massive amount of partnerships/interest, even at an early stage, and can be adopted on a mass scale without requiring the public to know that it exists, unlike nearly every other crypto which requires the public to buy, store, and use their crypto.

That my friend, is how you capture people's attention in a short and non-technical article(note: this wasn't an attempt at an article, just writing) and truly intrigue them into doing more research.  The funny thing is, I missed so much - I didn't even talk about MCT, VeVID, INPI's/VeChain's innovative nano-tech codes, how VeChain has been in operation for 2+ years on a private chain, their Carbon Credits program, or how they're solving the problem of trust/transparency... I just slammed this out in 15 minutes from memory.  Anyway, hope this helps, looking forward to your next article! :)

**EDIT:** this was a **HUGE** piece missing from what I just wrote - VeChain is also a decentralized supercomputer that will host dApps, all of which also utilize VeChain's network/burn VTHO - dBet, an online casino, Plair, an e-sports streaming/betting platform(Twitch was just banned in China), Cahreheit which was started by the co-founder of the Uber of China(which is now a monopoly), and OceanEX, a full crypto exchange running on VeChain, Safehaven, just to name a few... in addition to Arkane and EZPZ making it as easy as possible to build dApps on VeChain/transfer over from Ethereum, or DB Schneker's dApp they built on VeChain - all of which has access to MPP, MCT, and 101 Authority nodes which can easily be scaled(unlike fully decentralized networks with 20k+ nodes) to handle the traffic while remaining secure with stable, predictable transaction costs for enterprises.",18-10-11-08-49,2,416,Supernova752,9n3wg2

There you go wrong already since there are not many smokers (from the 300-350 Million Chinese smokers) who could afford $4/pack of cigarettes.
The minimum price per pack is $0,21 (! yes, 0,21ct) and the most expensive pack of cigarettes comes to $ 15.70. It's obvious that the far majority of rural smokers (most of them are in rural areas) smoke dirt cheap (counterfeit) cigarettes which are non branded unlike Marlboro which costs some $2/pack. So your average is way too high, the same as the 42 Billion packs figure . You have to do better homework.

I don't entirely understand this nor do i understand how the cost would be stable enough to be consistent.  

I imagine ""Company A"" can understand how much this system is by simply taking the amount of batches/crates/lots and multiplying the amount of data points they have in the supply chain (thus requiring VTHO).
So if i imagine a small operation of 5 batches a day touching 15 data points should require 75 data touches in the supply chain.  If each data touch is (hypothetically) 10 VTHO -the company could need 750 VTHO/day 
This would mean they need to shell out 
1,785,800 VET this would be about 25k for lifetime access (or in software, a perpetual license) in order to continuously register their batches on the chain. 
If price of VET/VTHO goes up then VTHO would need to regularly be adjusted in order to have stability.  The VTHO requirement would go down so now instead of 10 VTHO maybe this company only needs 2 VTHO per data hit or 150 VTHO per day.

Another point you could add and I also believe is going to impact TPS quite a bit is Track&Trace solutions.

I am working with some of the most promising projects looking to launch in this space, top tier experts from Harvard and MIT, and they are looking at a lot of networks, and I will give you a hint, ETH is low on that list, and for precisely the reasons VeChain identified. It's not enough to have good tech. ETH has fundamental design flaws that overengineering may solve, but will ultimately impair their ability to compete in the long run. They are a great 2.0 tech, and nothing but respect for VB, but he did not have the business experience to design  for what are becoming fundamental design limitations for adoption.

Now imagine that an aircraft manufacturer required that all of their OEM parts dealers had to serialize on a blockchain. Both for QC (a bad patch of part X is found and they need to identify all aircraft in service that have a part from that batch, for example.) From a liability standpoint as well as a loss of use for taking a plane out of service, there is a fundamental value here. This is just one example. Similarly this type of tech could be applied to military ordinance, pharmaceuticals, safety devices, etc. I also could see regulatory or certifying organisations such as UL leveraging this tech.

Also during the interviews with Vechain it was stated that if you would purchase their RFID tech you wouldn't need to purchase VTHO anymore on the open market. Per chip it would be sustained, so take into account you could potentially use a chip for 2-3 supply chain cycles it wouldn't be that much of a cost to larger companies.
