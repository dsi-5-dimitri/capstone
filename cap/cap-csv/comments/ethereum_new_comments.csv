1,"There are several key weaknesses.  The first is that people are not slaves to their identity, and life gets in the way of promises.  Although having to play at a predetermined time will work for most people for most of the time, it will work for no people for all of the time.  Since the game is continuous, it will eventually filter everyone out.

Second, any mechanism to allow individuals to maybe not show up when their turn comes allows them to not show up on their behalf, but show up on behalf of someone else... So you can have stand-in proxy humans play for other humans.

Third, a token issued to a person is transferrable.  Yes, you know for certain that *a* person knows the correspondence between password  P and account A.  You do not know that this person has not sold or exchanged this information with an imposter, or had their key compromised.

The only way to defeat this opportunity is to create a link between the digital and real-world identities of people, which defeats your imagined circumstances.  Because identity is not just a thing that you know.  It is a thing that you are.

Identities could certainly be sold or traded away under this design. That might be an issue for some use cases. In the model of rough democratic governance I'm imagining, however, this would be a reasonable trade-off. I'm uncomfortable expecting too much oversight as this complicates the privacy of the system. I'm also of the opinion that people should have the right to sell of trade away their uniqueness, if they so desire.

This is a legitimate social coordination obstacle in a global identity context. Perhaps a better way to frame this mechanism would be in terms of a regional or small world community setting. I'm uncertain whether the first issue couldn't be addressed by sharding the identity registry and allowing for cross-registry synchrony in some manner. Perhaps this might be solvable post-Serenity?

To your second and third points, I would want to make the case that generic human uniqueness with strong privacy guarantees is a worthy goal in itself, even if we can't have perfectly isomorphic identities or otherwise prevent the exchange of these identities. It's difficult to quantify this kind of trade-off, but my overall impression is that it would still be an improvement over many if not all existing schemes (at least, for certain important use cases). There also may be mechanisms to constrain these weaknesses. Making this an iterated game is one.

So is solving world hunger.  The worthiness of a goal does not make a flawed implementation any less flawed. Or magic a solution into existence.  

>There also may be mechanisms to constrain these weaknesses.  

The key words here are ""there may be"".  Until then, the solution is broken, and exploitable, and provably so.  So you can't just brush it away as an exercise for the reader to maybe solve one day.   One of the key known issues of an online identity is substitution. Almost all of the reasonable workarounds involve a correspondence between online and real-world identity (e.g. the gamut of KYC).  Yet you theorize that it does not need to exist, without offering proof, and in the face of known data.  It's a theory, but it's not a very strong theory.

In this case, they would forfeit their identity claim for some duration. If there are multiple identity systems operating in parallel, they could register in a different community. Invalidating the entire system because a handful of identities are invalidated would seem to be a significant waste on at least utilitarian grounds.

>You can't take a solution predicated on ""a human must be playing"" to backstop ""my"" identity if there are billions of other humans somewhere else who might be playing on my behalf.

The mechanism merely aims to prove the uniqueness of some arbitrary set of sentient players. It offers no assurances about ""who"" those players are . As I said, I'm not claiming a perfect correspondence. That's a separate and unrelated problem. The idea here isn't so much about proving ""you"" are ""you"", but proving there are only so many unique players with access to private keys. This is why I call it a ""generic"" property.

>The worthiness of a goal does not make a flawed implementation any less flawed.

All blockchain-based identity schemes have their ""flaws"" (or limitations). Again, it's a question of trade-offs and what the particular use cases require of us. Being able to assert this generic property of ""humanness"" in a rough democratic system, for instance, would offer a more egalitarian and less invasive alternative to the various KYC-AML and coin-voting schemes. While some identities in the system may have been traded away that wouldn't suggest the vast majority of other participants are non-genuine. As I said, I would ""want to make the case""; I didn't say I provided a full-fledged argument. I admit this is more a thought experiment. There are many other nuances and implications to work out.

>Until then, the solution is broken, and exploitable, and provably so. So you can't just brush it away as an exercise for the reader to maybe solve one day \[...\] It's a theory, but it's not a very strong theory.

I think you're expecting a form of perfection that will render most solutions impractical. I'm basically just biting the bullet on your substitution objection and saying that we can still design some very interesting governance constructs regardless. I'm looking at this generic humanness as a system property; rather than as an individual property. Just because someone will trade away their identity, doesn't mean that everyone participating in the system will; especially not when you have other incentives or mechanisms constraining this behavior. I have yet to even explore all of these possibilities.

>Sure. And with a proper fulcrum, Archimedes could move the world.

Witty, but this is a *reductio ad absurdum*, it seems to me.

20,"**Panarchy**

Panarchy (from pan and archy), coined by Paul Emile de Puydt in 1860, is a form of governance that would encompass all others.  The Oxford English Dictionary lists the noun as ""chiefly poetic"" with the meaning ""a universal realm,"" citing an 1848 attestation by Philip James Bailey, ""the starry panarchy of space"". The adjective panarchic ""all-ruling"" has earlier attestations. In the twentieth century the term was re-coined separately by scholars in international relations to describe the notion of global governance and then by systems theorists to describe non-hierarchical organizing theories.

The combination of the existing and source videos results in a fake video that shows a person or persons performing an action at an event that never occurred in reality.

Such fake videos can be created to, for example, show a person performing sex acts they never took part in, or can be used to alter the words or gestures a politician uses to make it look like that person said something they never did.

At the very least they won’t be allowed to be on AMD and Nvidia’s payroll at the same time, even for regular employees.

Let me explain: I push that topic because I think Ethereum would have been further ahead in terms of development, and consequently adoption, if Afri and the others had to answer to a professional, skilled project manager that again reported to a board/foundation consisting of representatives from the four groups of the founder, users, ecosystem, and tokenholders. Hiring a world-class project manager and a communications expert would reduce chances of infighting, help devs not go off on tangents, synchronize their work better, reduce redundancy, and minimize duplicity in research efforts. The communications person would also minimize public relations missteps, prevent tweets like ""Not sure Ethereum will ever upgrade,"" ""Project X is everything Ethereum could have been,"" ""No Constantinople in 2018,"" etc.

I think the environment Ethereum is facing now is radically different from just two years ago, both from a competition and an ecosystem perspective. Ethereum must become more structured until 2.0/3.0 is out, if not, the product may be too late to the market (unless Vitalik ends up doing everything himself, Ethereum must make use of skilled project management and someone that can organize and hold the devs's feet to the fire, and prevent them from going off on these nonsensical tangents that have manifested the last six to eight months).

At a minimum the dev calls much be structured better (they should perhaps introduce anonymous voting at the end of those meetings so that decisions can be made in a timely manner when required).",19-02-23-08-23,13,7,cryptojan,atn1ta
241,"Re-read the article and I admit that you are right and I was wrong. It is a very strong attack on Nick Szabo (the tone was not good at all), which is very unfortunate because Nick Szabo seems like a very good man that do not deserve something like that (being indirectly blamed for all the ills in the cryptoworld). **Ethereum may have dodged yet another bullet with Vlad refocusing his attention elsewhere**.

a) The approach you put into your medium response was never set forward prior to that response, in any conversation with me.  Please stop stretching the truth.

b) I did not misrepresent any of your claims, as presented.  Perhaps your presentation is just poor, if what you said wasn't what you actually meant?

> None of these capabilities are feature-equivalent to create2, and in general cold wallets, HW wallets, light hardware, and L2 solutions such as state channels will benefit greatly from the advantages create2 provides, especially going forward into future versions of Ethereum.

Your [original claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aosaly/create2_eip_vulnerability_questions/egf4f3b/), the one I was contesting, was this:

> The broader issue is that an address isn't a commitment to any specific code. Sure, there are patterns you can use to produce these commitments in a stateful sense, but that just means anyone wanting to authenticate an address has to authenticate the whole state.

Which isn't exactly true.  An address *can* be a commitment to specific code, exactly in the same way `create2` creates an address that is a commitment for specific code.  The *only* difference is that you have to publish this commitment on-chain--which, presumably, is the ""stateful"" part of your claim.  I don't see how that's a problem--you can use that on-chain commitment as a convenient mechanism for ensuring the can be deployed by anyone, in the event of counterparty failure.  This is required even by `create2`, but harder to do in a trustless fashion.

Also, `create2` comes with the side effect of breaking the immutability of code invariant, which seems like a really steep price to pay for ""statelessness""... especially since it requires *even more* monitoring of state to avoid. It's also worth pointing out that `create2` only commits to bytecode, which makes verifying `init_code` an even harder task.  Changes in compiler optimizations, etc, can easily change the bytecode, making verification harder, especially in the use cases you seem to be advocating for (offline, hw wallets, etc).  You shouldn't ignore these side effects, nor should the burden of education around them be offloaded to ""the community"", as you seem in favor of doing.

In essence, you're privatising gains (enabling your specific use case), while socialising the losses (the burden of education and tooling).

>  None of these capabilities are feature-equivalent to create2

`create2` is, put simply, the commitment to specific code at a specific address.  The `Create2` contract I put forth in this article is exactly that: commitment to specific code at a specific address.  Again, the only difference is the lack of an on-chain commitment to that code.

> https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1095854769183358976

This misrepresents `create` in a bunch of ways, calls it bad for vague reasons that you never explain, and claims `create2` is the only way to solve all of these shortcomings--again, without really explaining what those shortcomings are.

> https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1096053407880806400

Hey wait a minute, isn't ""storage rent"" the very thing that opens the possibility of nonce reuse by EOAs?  You know, the thing that, when combined with `create2`, has the potential to bring back contracts created with `create` that had been selfdestructed?

Sia uses probabilistic methods to perform the proof of storage. When it's time to prove that the host still has the data, Sia requests a random 64 byte segment of the file.

If the host cannot produce the segment, then the host is penalized - they don't just not get paid, they also lose collateral that they posted.

XYO is a member of MOBI, and a peer alongside global leaders including BMW, IBM, General Motors and Ford. The award was presented to the XYO team on February 15th, at the culmination of the first MOBI Grand Challenge Hackathon at the headquarters of MOBI community member BMW Group in Munich, Germany.

The MOBI award for XYO specifically commends the company’s contributions to the creation of a viable, decentralized, mobile ad-hoc network of blockchain / distributed ledger technology (DLT) connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that can reliably share data, coordinate behavior, and ultimately improve human mobility and quality of life.

Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder and Head of Operations commented on the win: “We are ‘over the moon’ at winning this award, and also by the strong showing of support the community has shown for our project and technology. With blockchain we can significantly improve the interconnectivity and usefulness of data between today’s smart devices and vehicles, and we’ll use this award to push the boundaries of what’s possible as we build out the ‘Internet-of-All-Things’ and a more connected world.”",19-02-21-07-40,2,395,frankie_mastro,astf7t

- it possibly broadcasts my (encrypted or not) location to the broader internet. I know I can have a private cluster of IPFS nodes but this feels like an overkill for such small amount of data. IPFS is made for bigger blobs and esp. it's made for wide sharing over one global IPFS network, not small fractal clusters.

on a small Single Board Computer locally... so the device:

- has its precise lat,lng saved on its SDCARD and *nowhere else*

Now the device can show me exact sunrise and sunset information. JUST LIKE some iPhone apps, except that they ask me for my location and use it on a third party device (iPhone) and possibly everywhere else.

Any comments why is this not an ideal starting point about IoT and Location questions? It is also very decentralized in the LAN sense because each device on the same LAN (and thus lat, lng) can have a clone of this data - actually a clone of the SDCARD more or less.

Everything after that is still open and there can be many protocols to share this further as needed but as a starting point I think I'll take it.. Have been using this for last 2 years.

allowing children to gamble is morally (and legally) wrong.  i don't know how you can think that its ok to allow that.

projects that allow gambling that don't use KYC are most likely illegal and the teams that operate them are anonymous.   the developers of those games risk prosecution and arrest if they offer their gaming to children, who should not be gambling, nor to some countries, where gambling is illegal.  you can't tell if the customer is a child or coming from an illegal country if you don't do kyc.

etheroll and sport crypt are using layer 1 and their gaming transactions are slow and cumbersome.   they 'work' and are doing well, but are not scalable to mass market use and are comparatively expensive - costing the user gas for each 'roll' or bet.

FunFair is built using a highly scalable and efficient layer 2 solution that is gas efficient and high performance.    for instance, FunFair can allow the customer to do more than a hundred dice rolls in the same time and cost as legacy apps can do just one dice roll and cost the customer a lot of gas.   but more importantly, the funfair tech can run more sophisticated and general apps and games, like blackjack, roulette, slot machines etc - that involve multi stage and multiple transactions per game.  something that could not efficiently be done on chain.   This allows the FunFair tech to compete against legacy online casinos that use centralised servers, which is the bulk of the online gaming market.

FunFair has built certain functionality into the FUN token that makes it well suited for gaming applications.

for example, two advanced features built into the FUN token are, 1. to assist in opening state channels quickly in one transaction including escrow deposits from both untrusted accounts of the player and casino, and 2.  FUN helps to protect the casino's bankroll from hackers or compromises to the private key.

neither of these functions are available directly with eth or dai or any existing token (unless the casino isn't fully trustless)

as for the friction of the player requiring to acquire FUN tokens before they can play, we have several ways to mitigate this friction.   The first is that we are comping the player their first FUN and Eth so they can try the games.  and we support dexs to acquire FUN tokens from eth in one click/tx for instance airswap and soon uniswap.   and a future version of our state channels could auto convert in and out to FUN tokens if that was deemed beneficial, so we do not believe there will be significant friction from our use of the FUN token in the future.",19-02-21-01-46,6,1048,JezSan,asp4b8

So no one can actually terminate Augur or force a network upgrade. People have to support each fork the same way as Eth. Please correct me with specifics if I'm mistaken on that.

Funfair is not decentralized in the same way. They have a contract owner, the burn is ""singed"" and the remainder is sent to a wallet funfair owns. So unless I'm mistaken there's a big difference between Augur and Funfair. When it isn't decentralized you are personally accountable.

Many live a free life, and freedom to some means doing whatever you want - and some go on to extend this to mean 'without being judged'. There is an old story of a pupil who sought the affection of a master. This master, however, was frequently ill-tempered, prone to erratic moods. The pupil, having lived a pure life, was unable to identify the cause of these mood swings, and instead interpreted them as the natural, accepted behavior of adults in common - and went on to lash out using 'passive aggressive' or subversive tactics.

It wasn't till many years later that this pupil came to realize that the Lion had a slew of drugs injected into his system, leading to his bad behavior. His erratic and terrible deeds were the latent effects of drug abuse - his freedom to acquire a drug addiction impugned upon the pupils ability to develop, in good health. Should the Lion be judged?

Story 2:

Two boys enter into the woods, and come out bruised. One boy cries and cries and cries, the other boy goes back to work on the farm. Weeks go by, and while the other boy worked, the other worked on creating a campaign of pity, for it was well known that the farm boy was proud and quiet.

And as the sad boy went on retelling stories, creating illustrations, and adding to his rhetoric, he had gone so far as to say that this was not the case of two boys fighting in the woods, but a habitual problem of proud, quiet boys meeting and plotting - and engaging in racists behavior toward the lazy boys of the town.

And the quiet boy stayed quiet, until his home was burned.

Story 3:

People gathered around and a woman lied in the middle. ""Adulter, charlateen... naive!"" they cried, and worse, and killed her on the spot.

But then there was no bread, for she had made the bread, and her orphaned child was caught stealing a carrot - and slain. But then too, another townsperson, who relied upon the child for work missed his deadline, and he too was slain. His replacement was even less apt than the prior, the house he built fell - and he too was slain.

And around the circle it went until extinction, each one thinking themself better than those gone before.

Story 4:

Mother raises her child; she was a bad child, but she never abandoned her. In all times of strife, the mother showed only love and compassion - the traits we all hold dear.

Being of wealthy birth, the child went on to flaunt her destructive ways, abusing the servants and abusing herself. For her life was one of great ease, no challenge or accomplishment necessary whatsoever - all she had to do is live with the great wealth in which she was entrusted. However, a great wind blew and one day the world was reset - all houses were destroyed and all historic nobelity was lost.

But the servants, they showed her kindness. The people, they held no grudges. Still, as fortune would have it, she could not survive - for her mother had never taught her independence, and when it came time to suffer the long toil of work - she took her own life instead, with an expensive cocktail and bitterness upon her every breath, cursing her negligent mother.

However, you (more so in the past, your posts/comments are much more reasonable now), Hudson, and Nick, keep fore-fronting the Internet mob narrative. I believe that is a deflection and not the issue here. There has not been offered a single piece of evidence that a major tokenholder has expressed any form of violent threats. And even in the event such evidence existed, the community at large has gone beyond themselves as a whole to thank Afri for his work and glorified his contribution, for the most part. That is what you should focus on, not on potential punks that exist everywhere. The evidence is therefore solid that up until now this argument has functioned as a strawman that serves to limit discussion of the real issues. This may be because some, not all, in the EF want to keep plugging along in their bubble and do not want change, and some perhaps  also fear scrutiny of their own roles in this. The main issue here is the structure and executional capability of the EF foundation, which world renowned venture capitalist and Ethereum investor Fred Wilson called ""lackadaisical."" If you care about your friend Afri, and want to understand what happened, you should consider that if the EF had been better structured and more responsible as well as responsive, Afri would still be part of the lead developers working for Ethereum. Afri is not the prime cause of the problems, his poor choice of actions at times are mostly just symptoms of the problems within the EF that were allowed to permeate the culture and express themselves in such unacceptable manners.

I disagree with you on one issue though. Ethereum is actually not a decentralized project at the moment.

As it should be. Its an open source tech project. Could it use someone more business oriented in a role or two, maybe. Token holders IMO don't belong at the table though, because ETH isn't a security so you're not entitled to anything for holding it. And I say this as someone who's a programmer and holds ETH, but hasn't contributed to core code at all. If I want a say in the project, its my responsibility to contribute to it and then I can have my say, because that's how open source software works. If I don't bother contributing, then it would be ridiculous of me to bitch about not having a say, because why would l get one when I've added no value to the development of the project? 

The only thing stopping token holders from being heard (other than the fact they just hang out on Reddit and Twitter... which aren't the appropriate forums to get the attention of the team) is that they don't bother contributing, and if you can't contribute then put frankly, you get what you get. Not to mention if you're not contributing, your information is second hand at best and your opinion is 100% guaranteed to be missing critical details about the inner-workings of the project. You can't know what you don't know, and if you're not a dev there's a whole world of shit you don't know, since even as a programmer I know there's world of shit _I_ don't know, which is why its important that the devs who do know dictate direction. Mobs are irrational, uninformed, and will always end up creating a bloated, broken project in the end if you give their opinion more weight than it deserves. Opening the project up to [design by committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee) is a sure fire way to put it on the fast track to self destruction. 

I get that token holders want a say, and token holders feel like they're super smart and understand everything perfectly.

I've been warning the Ethereum moderation team about Afri's problematic, disrespectful way of modding **more than 2 years ago**.

They laughed it away and said they supported the way he handled things.

Well, here we are. 2 years later. 

The moment arrived that he needed the community's support. But there were not enough supporters left.

That's what happens when you kick people left and right in an arrogant, shortsighted, disrespectful manner.

Someone here reminded me of the Taylor situation, where she was also getting attacked, and how that time was different. Because of her friendly and respectful behavior in the weeks, months, years before, she got the community support she needed in those hard times, and she survived it.

Afri learned the hard way that, in the end, human decency is a fundamental skill as well: the people you kicked today, might have been the ones who would've defended you tomorrow.

I just had a discussion today with one of the Ethereum moderators who defended his behavior 2 years ago, and it's sad to see that this message is still not coming across. 

Moderating a community, keeping the group together and keeping everyone happy, requires different skills than programming. 

Today we've paid the price for this as a community, by losing a skillful developer like Afri who's work I highly respect.


#The Positive

I hope lessons can be learned from this. And mistakes can be corrected. 

I for one, would fully support a comeback of Afri to Ethereum. 

There is no need to escalate the situation any further and I hope mutual understanding can be reached between the devs and the community.

Let us be reminded, that a vocal minority has attacked Afri and it's effectively the lack of a defending majority that has taken perception out of balance.  But I do believe that this silent supportive majority is out there.

It's a mistake to believe this incident would be a fair representation of the relation between the devs and the community.

My recommendation would be for the members of the Ethereum foundation (who are active on Reddit), to increase their community staff here to more acceptable levels to relieve the workload of the main crew, an additional staff that can help to try creating a more positive open community as we grow. Preventing a possible disconnection between the devs and the community.

918,"I just read the letter, and while I don't think it needs to be issued at this point, if they want to, that is their prerogative.  I will not try to stop them.  It is a group of developers, expressing concern about how they feel about how ""one of their own"" was treated.  It makes some references to r/ethtrader, and some of the discussion which occurred here.

What I am more concerned about is where do we go from here.

I understand the difficult position the devs feel they are in.  I also hope they realize that much of the damage here was hopefully a somewhat isolated incident (given some of the ""colorful"" forms of engagement which Afri chose which I have not seen any other prominent dev engage in).  That is not an excuse for those who took up arms against him, but it is an observation that I doubt we will see similar issues of equal severity in the near future.  Still, it doesn't mean it couldn't happen, hence the possible applicability this concerned letter.  As someone who has been attacked here personally, I can sympathize to a degree.

I'm happy to hear the devs express their concerns, and work productively with them as **one community** to address intolerance.  Not as two communities, with one thinking of the other in a consistently pejorative manner, questioning their value to the ecosystem.  But honestly, moving on from today, I'd prefer not to blow that ""intolerance"" out of proportion any further.

To those devs, I'd only say this: know that there are forces that operate in this r/ethtrader that none of us can control at times.  They include paid actors, and others who would seek to sow division in our community. Come down on us hard, tell us we're all terrible people over and over again, malign an entire sub of 200K people of guilt and culpability, and you're only playing into their hands by radicalizing fringe elements of this community, or providing a narrative for those malicious actors who seek that radicalization.  Work with us, and participate as community members, and they won't have a leg to stand upon in the future.

There is no reason to divide us and think us as different communities- we can be one community.  Your move, devs and r/ethtrader.  I've said more than enough at this point.

921,"The linked document mentions negative reactions to Lane Rettig and Taylor Monahan. 


Some perspective: while Lane Rettig proposed to increase diversity in this Medium post: https://medium.com/@lrettig/how-open-is-too-open-bfc412cf0d24, his vision of ""diversity"" is a head count of the melanin on display. More black? Good, regardless if it's upper class from Manhattan. More white? Bad, regardless if it's lower class from Poland.


These racialized views of individuals, with the frankly disgusting ""person of color"" moniker, might be (unfortunately) valid in the ivory tower subconscious of the American upper middle class. But Ethereum claims to be a world project, and amongst a worldwide community, you are bound to find reactions rejecting American imperialism, in ideology as in everything else.


As for Taylor Monahan, her original move to launch MyCrypto was rather... unconventional: she took the MyEtherWallet twitter account and its thousands of followers, and changed it overnight, on the basis she felt a personal connection to this account. The entitlement didn't play well with the community, who felt the other half of MyEtherWallet, Kosala Hemachandra, was unfairly treated (and indeed, is ""nonpersoned"" in this document). Later, lawsuits dating back months between the two, involving money, more money and VC money, led to more inflammatory responses to the public front of innocence.


(Taylor has since apologized to the community, and the Twitter account was given back. Lane has made no comments.)


Let's consider the so-called campaign of hate. One moment the dissenting voices are ""a vocal minority""; the next second, the community must not fall prey to ""mob rule"". Anyone who doesn't fall in ideological lockstep with the inner circle ends up with their legitimacy questioned, and history is rewritten to account for one and only one perspective.


This document was signed by 97 devs. 97 individuals, reading this document, its purposeful misrepresentation of the facts and its negative misinterpretation of the larger Ethereum community, decided to put their name on it.


Could we find 97 people signing below any so-called ""troll"" reply? Or would there be healthy debates, partial agreements on some points but disagreements on others, refinements and multitudes of individual perspectives... as it should be?

Agreed. There are 400,000 subscribers on r/ethereum of varied backgrounds with different insights and opinions, we each bring something different to the table.

There are engineers, students, scientists, artists, finance people, truckers, martial artists- you name it here. For instance I won't be able to help the devs push Casper out but if they want a node launched into geosynchronous orbit I could lend a hand.

My thoughts on some excerpts:

>Don’t you realize how much this intimidates us? The voices behind Ethereum have shared their thoughts. We still need more.

Yes there needs to be a healthy and open exchange of ideas for you to see success, but core players/devs can no longer be careless in what they say or how they say it because Ethereum is now a massive ecosystem with billions of dollars attached to it. You have more responsibility to uphold this principle than random internet commentators, you should be held to a higher standard.

>As we build fairer systems, let’s also ensure that we build better protocols for expressing community concerns.

That's encouraging, and I hope they take that seriously.

928,"Assuming this document is legit (which the Google Doc link seems to be) and not a hoax, it raises a ton of questions.  For all the references to 'free speech' and allowance for dissenting opinions, it sure seems like only 'approved speech' and dissenting opinions *by certain parties* should be permitted, going forward.

I legitimately wonder how I'm supposed to raise a concern in the future, if I want to question the content of any public communication made by a core dev.  What if my 'honest' and 'well-thought out' question triggers a mob response?  Should I just not ask it then?  Should I ignore potential conflicts of interest and hope everything works out for the best? What are the appropriate avenues for raising an issue?  Are certain contributors beyond reproach, and just not responsible for their words and actions in any capacity?  Does the threat of 'verbal violence' necessitate stifling the potential for valid discourse?  These are not meant as rhetorical questions, they're ones I'd honestly like to hear answers to.

I first learned about Ethereum due to a random news article about the DAO.  I spent a month and a half doing research and watching how that drama played out.  When all was said and done, I was impressed -- convinced enough by what I saw, I took a huge risk and invested much more than I could afford to lose in the protocol (I got lucky with the bull run, and have since diversified my holdings much more sanely).  I liked the way that things were handled, and I saw the promise and potential of Ethereum, both the software and the community.  Despite the delays in getting proof-of-stake and sharding released, I remained a steadfast proponent of Ethereum, convinced that there were complex engineering problems which were taking longer to solve.

These days, I'm not so convinced the main issues are technical, and for the first time since then, I'm actually really worried about Ethereum's future.

To be perfectly blunt, Ethereum is going to be superseded if it doesn't get its shit together soon.  All the hard work the devs have done and will continue to do won't matter in the least if we can't all pull together and find a better form of governance, and a stronger management structure.  Dfinity or whoever else is going release a functional product, far superior to Ethereum, with an engaged group of high-level executives who are able to properly communicate with the masses, and navigate the sometimes-uncomfortable world of being a public figure.  Seemingly, this will be a day to celebrate for many of the devs, who aren't concerned about foolishness like 'maximalism' and apparently they will cheer on the success of their peers, while the code into which they've put their blood, sweat, and tears lies fallow and unused.

# Rage Against the (Ethereum Virtual) Machine

## Disclaimer: as in our usual provocative style, the title of the article intends to explain the byproduct of the events unfolded this weekend, in a light-hearted manner. 

The Department of Decentralization was created to push open source development, the people behind it, and to grow awareness by educating the community. These past days, one of our collaborators, friends, and the catalyzer of the Görli Testnet, Afri, has been in the eye of the storm of an uncontrollable angry mob, that, triggered by a couple of tweets, turned menacing, dark and most importantly, reflected everything that as a community, we should avoid.

DoD categorically rejects these actions. Even though we understand the nature of Afri’s tweets have been a bit triggering, these opinions were personal and any threats against a person’s well-being shall never be justified. The stream of reactions, ranging from personal threats to demands, unrealistic conspiracy theories, etc.. We believe Ethereum community is a progressive community, that values freedom, free speech, privacy but humanity and better systems above all.  

DoD does not have a significant investment on ETH, or any coin. We help developers build better tools. It is then, our responsibility, to protect our own and to preserve the existence of the Görli testnet. 

Now to how this might affect Ethereum. The network is built, maintained and scaled by HUMANS. These humans are not on 24/7 call, they are entitled to their opinions, and any means they want to express them in. This hate campaign has upset some of the minds behind the project, and hurt a lot of contributors, whether developers or not. 

Now to the angry mob: how do you expect us to move past this, as humans? Don’t you realize how much this intimidates us? The voices behind Ethereum have voiced their thoughts. We still need more, of course.

I would want to, but the problem is that the main case that I was personally involved in, was played out mainly in a private moderation conversations with the Ethereum moderation team. ( https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/79dqxt the team can access it though) 

That is the problem with these cases, they all play out in private conversations:

* first it starts with a ban or censor, these events are hidden from view, nobody gets to see them except the ones personally involved (the ones who received a ban)

* and secondly, ""how things are treated furtherly"", also happens in private conversations, which we also don't have access to.

And it's not the banning (the first part) that makes the difference. It's the second part. How a person gets treated after a ban: 

*Does he get a chance to defend himself? Does he get threatened with a longer ban? Or does he get ignored entirely?* **Overall, does he get respected as a conscious human adult?**

This latter part, is where Afri absolutely failed. Probably also on the first part, but most definitely on the second part.

I can confirm this from personal experience, and judging by testimonies I've read in the past over a period of 2 years.

I personally probably would have defended him instead of abstaining. If there was a positive memory. 

When Taylor was attacked, I jumped on it to cover for her because I was reminded of my positive encounters with here and you want to give something back for that.

When Afri was attacked however, I had a ""I don't care"" attitude and I didn't participate in the conversation (nor in an attack nor in his defense). It's because I was not reminded of any positive encounters with him.

In the example you gave, the goal would be for a transaction to use the _maximum_ gas if mined by the intended miner, or else use the _minimum_ gas.

In order to execute the code you included, a contract would need to be deployed, which has a minimum gas cost of 32,000. The current block gas limit is about 8,000,000 gas, so that would be the maximum gas used.

That's a 250x difference between the minimum and the maximum. So if a 0.01 ETH fee is paid for the minimum, then only 2.5 ETH would be paid out for the maximum.

I've been thinking about the best way to handle this. To me, this seems like a problem with supply and demand, but using non-fungible tokens, it is possible to have multiple copies of the same book that can be checkout to separate people. Although this won't solve the problem, I'm hoping it will be ok in the early stage, to have enough copies to adequately supply a small initial amount of users.

Everyone’s expectations to be treated as investors and developers be held accountable as business executives has some validity in it but only in a limited sense. We should only expect the unexpected. Personally the only thing I expect from every Crypto is that it will face turbulence in search of identity. This is after all a new and radical industry with different rules and governance. Exodus of several developers has been seen before in Bitcoin but for the better, surprisingly. Ethereum has to eventually go through the same to leave the spotlight for new emerging talent and thought leaders. If you are an investor in this scene, you’ll need to get used to that nothing here will ever be the same as where you once came from.

However, the main problem as I see it is a holdover from the OSS movement of the 90s and early naughts:  how does one monetize Open Source Software?  There's two fundamental ways:  have it run on specialized locked-down hardware, such as Google did with Android.  This for-profit company then hires developers as needed.  The blockchain route is to ""tokenize"" development.  In other words, developers sell a white paper using magic internet money as the receipt for investors.  The problem with the latter is there's no sense of urgency to development let alone actual deployment, so you have deployment being put on hiatus for months at a time for holidays.  I'm still skeptical that Constantinople will actually be deployed this February 28, being National Pokemon Day and all....

There's also zero, absolutely no concern for the performance of these tokens in the market:  the developers got paid already upfront, so they don't care how their ""schedule"" affects valuations.  It's ready when it's ready or ""real soon now"" has been the mantra, which harkens back to other projects in development hell for extended periods of time.

Afri was active in various places to code and organise work to improve the Ethereum core protocol. Often for free and because he believed in shared philosophy of the community. He has a good reputation with many other contributors.

After one last attempt to discuss the topic of the Polkadot vs Serenity design (and initially coming out as a proponent for Polkadot, which I interpreted as means to provoke people into responding) many of those anonymous complainers were angry and started questioning his loyalty to them instead of arguing his point.

This... You make good points. My impression from listening to dev calls and reading articles from journalists and comments from devs and people in the EF is that everything from minor details of implementation to overall strategy is fully ad-hock at the moment. This haphazard approach increasingly materialized over the last year as Vitalik withdrew somewhat, but the EF has never been very goal-oriented, dynamic, and organized to begin with. Afri Schoedon, and many of the others are stated followers of Chaos philosophy and this has shone through the project, unfortunately. The developers need to answer to a professional, skilled project manager that again answers to the two groups of the users/ecosystem and the tokenholders. This can no longer be dev lead. It does not work.

> The psychological impact of waking up every day to multiple people commenting about your shortcomings can't be overstated.

It most certainly can be overstated, and is overstated, by anyone who does not understand that external criticism has no inherent impact on our inner peace. Any negative internal impact of external criticism is simply the result of not being a resilient individual, at least in the context of receiving criticism.

""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" - Aristotle

We allow things to bother us. We permit ourselves to be affected or offended by the mere words of others. This happens due to our own insecurities regarding what it means to live a good life. According to Stoicism, one only needs to ensure that we pursue virtue, so as to not betray our own internal probity, in order to live a good life. Stoicism is arguably the most tangible and useful philosophy for those in positions such as global leaders and anyone who is in a position that exposes their being to a myriad of public criticism. This has been proven by the likes of Marcus Aurelius, who was the closest embodiment in history to Plato's ""Philosopher King"", this man received criticism and endured hardship to a degree that makes Afri's twitter critisim appear to be a form of flattery, relatively speaking. Yet Marcus Aurelius was able to endure such experiences without betraying himself or his people, due to his philosophical foundation. I understand that I am likely to receive downvotes for saying this, but I feel that the decentralisation movement as a whole has made a mistake by making the technical side of the movement the cornerstone/foundation of the movement itself (it is literally why we have core members unable to handle some internet flak). I believe that philosophy is the only viable paradigm that can form the foundation of any movement hoping to reach its full potential.

If you have not read [The Enchiridion by Epictetus](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html), or [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf), I highly recommend doing so.

""If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you?"" - The Enchiridion, Epictetus

""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful,
arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions."" - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations",19-02-19-21-23,27,395,GaiaPariah,as8y75

An open source project handles a lot of stuff quite different than a megacorp or the US military. Everything happens out in the open and everyone can see everything. Discussions that normally would happen behind closed doors in companies (like what the competitors do better than we do) are put out into the public eye. This has the advantage that you can accumulate many different viewpoints from insiders, users, developers and outsiders. At the same time you loose the ability to hold many secrets.  


One important part of why open source works is because everyone that does not agree with something can criticize  a project, send a patch and if after some time there is no consensus a fork happens. To point out that another project does better in some aspects than we do ourselves is an important step to make the project the best it can be.

""If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: ""If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad."" For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy. Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine stolen? Say to yourself, ""This is the price paid for equanimity, for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing."" When you call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want.

""Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible.

If I was to summarize for this purpose it would be this:

People gather in groups of 8, elect 2 representatives (as mentioned), forming new groups of 8.

A 'final table' of 8 is created, which we can call 'the leaders'. Their objective is to Criticize and Direct, not to execute. In effect, they have no power, beyond the power of media attention.

These 8 join with 24 others from prior elections, forming a group of 32... 8 rotated in / out per cycle. The responsibility of these 32 is to ensure the wishes of the masses are enforced (signing checks, primarily).

Checks are issued in a 'direct democracy' system, for 2 purposes: to reward individuals and to reward groups. Tables vote on select individuals to reward (such as developers) and select groups (such as Parity, et al). In the full system, 32 individuals would win per cycle (paid equally) and 8 groups.

In addition to the 'direct democracy' aspects, there is also representative democracy in which the Representatives are awarded - however generally the Table from which Reps were selected are rewarded, rather than the individual, to foster community support.

Lastly, the leaders write 8 anonymous criticisms, and payouts are issued to the paper, not the individual (such as to an ETH address), and the 32 'prior leaders' plus some others issue a document of guidance toward the future - which you can think of as a 'road map'.

After the election process, everything disbands until next round.

A big difference in this system vs others is that 1) in order to vote, you must commit to a 1 hour discussion, and 2) you are essentially paid to vote vs losing time for nothing.

1673,"I believe so. The problem is that the centralized stablecoins have stolen the spotlight. 2-3 years ago the word ""decentralized"" actually meant something. Now we see multiple projects and platforms centralizing at an alarming rate.

The real winners will be the decentralized stablecoins. As far as I know there are less than a handful that can even fall in the category of 'decentralized' Of that handful, even less are 'truly' decentralized.I like DAI, and am impressed that it actually weathered through the extremely bearish ethereum market. However the sooner it can diversify its collateral, the better.

I am really interested in another project. [BitBay.Market](https://BitBay.Market)BitBay is almost finished with it's unique ""Dynamic Peg"" Protocol. It is not a hard peg. It doesn't require collateral. It simply allows investors to adjust supply in order to accommodate ever-changing demand. This can be achieved through a democratic voting consensus. Coin holders can attach votes to stake rewards and vote to either increase, decrease, or hold steady the current total coin supply. You have to stake to vote, so market mover manipulators that are trying to juggle the price on the exchanges have no voting power if they are stacking all their coins in the order books!Paul Donovan said it best back in Nov. 2018, "" *Every economist knows the store of value is about balancing supply and demand and with crypto currencies you cannot control the supply in response to a drop in demand.* ""

BitBay will be able to do just what he thinks will be the end of Bitcoin.

The system basically works like this...Every 3.5 hours a voting session ends. Coin holders can either vote manually or let default algorithm decide for them. In the near future, there will also be customizable TA indicator algo's for  coin holders to use (RSI, STOCH, SMA, etc.)If price begins to drop, the majority consensus can vote to freeze 1-3% of the total coins supply (depends on vote count) per voting session. So in one day there is roughly 7 voting sessions. So coin holders could essentially vote to freeze upwards of 21% of the total coin supply in one day.This can go for as long as it takes. When price stabilizes or begins to recover, voters can begin voting to unfreeze the total coins supply.So basically a bear trend can only last a few days before it reaches a flat trade range accumulation zone or turns bullish again. We are talking days compared to bitcoin's ability to take 1-2 years!Bears can still sell if they wish, but any frozen coins they have will only be able to be sold on a secondary market ""futures market"". Any frozen coin input sold on an exchange will have a 1 month time lock before it can be transferred. This way bears can still sell but they have a very limited power against a coin that can always adapt to their next move, hence, ""Dynamic Peg"".The coin is not hard pegged so it can't 'break'. It can change and hold new value. This opens the doors to create an extremely lucrative hedging mechanism to bitcoin.BitBay has completed private testnet phase. Prepping for public testnet that will be hosted on a mock/test exchange. Should hopefully be ready in the next 1-3 weeks for public testnet.

  
Every cryptocurrency that is trying to actually be used as a 'currency' should have a goal of being the next decentralize 'petro-dollar'. Stabilizing the volatility is the first step.

It was some mining algorithm change created to ""kill off the evil asics"" and ""bring power back to GPU miners"".

And so personally, I see it as anti-capitalism and anti-free market, as it destroys natural progress and competition in the space.  
  
Eventually the creators of ProgPoW (Kristy Leigh Minehan and a couple anons) were exposed for this, as well as running some shady mining company that screwed their customers and shut down. Then they deleted all remnants of themselves and their shadiness from the internet and disappeared.

IMHO people are asking for impossible, equality in a algorithm, just to somehow prove a strange point(trading one manufacture for another).

It doesn't change in a way that lets more people in. In that people need money to buy GPUs, knowledge to operate them, skill to operate in a profitable way. It doesn't stop advantages in someone getting a bunch of GPUs from source before the average joe can get them on Newegg, doesn't stop GPU mfgs from mining on their hardware before selling to consumers, doesn't stop the network affect of ppl with more hash rate getting more mining rewards then using those mining rewards to expand their mining business and gain a larger network share, etc. 

ASIC mfgs will never be able to compete with GPU mfgs on a ProgPoW network. I know people like to make the argument that ProgPoW doesn't kill ASICs, but it does... GPU mfgs can operate at a loss for much longer... do the Xbox play. Sell machines at a loss for so many years and make it up after they gain market share. No one will buy ASICs if they are more expensive than GPUs. So no more ASICs on the network. Then capitalism and competition is going to take play in the GPU only network, and the people that can run their GPU mines the most efficiently will get ahead. Then we're in the same situation we're currently arguing. 
  
Like I said before, ProgPoW doesn't do anything for decentralization, it centralizes to the GPU mfg that is willing to cater to ProgPoW needs. Ethereum is also still on the path to ASIC resistance via Proof of Stake.",19-02-19-06-56,0,584,CryptoAnthony,as1a7j

>After testing on a wider variety of GPUs we’ve discovered the current parameters unintentionally causes some AMD GPUs to be compute limited instead of memory limited. Reducing the random cache and math counts by 10% increases the hashrate on those AMD GPUs. This has no effect on the hashrate of other AMD GPUs or any the Nvidia GPUs we tested.

First of all, I dislike Polkadot as much as the next Etherean, however *Parity* did NOT receive $5mn for Polkadot. It was for ETH 2.0  development. There are milestones they must complete associated with the purpose of the grant.

Next, anyone that thinks Afri had unilateral control over the timeline of ETH 2.0 or any other release (e.g. Constantinople) is an idiot. Plain and simple. That isnt how Ethereum works. The release manager simply is charged with tracking progress of the client releases through testing and proposing a block height at which the fork will go live in production.

His tweet was provocative, and ill worded for the mass of reddit trolls who don’t know Afri and how he communicates. He’s blunt and provocative, and he was passionate about Ethereum development. His entire point was to stir the pot to get people off their asses... because there’s no time to be resting on laurels with the next competitor always right around the corner.

Let’s address COIs... this isn’t enterprise software development. People have many holdings, work for companies and teams developing and researching for multiple blockchains. It’s open collaboration... that’s the point. There are no NDAs, non-competes, contracts, teaming agreements, etc. amongst core development contributors. That would be asinine. This isn’t Tron or Ripple.

For transparency... what more do you want? Do you want the EF to publish their reviews of grants applications? I’m sure they’d do so. Everything else is more or less orders of magnitude more transparent than any legacy financial system processes. And you all just ran off one of the most radical proponents of full transparency in Afri... again,  people complain about Transparency, but it’s hard to be 100% transparent when people are being so fucking tribal and so fucking emotionally attached to their investments that they crucify anyone they disagree with from the community... why would a dev put themselves out there to be subject to the pitchfork wielding mob? Look at Alexey (Ledgerwatch) and the backlash and threats he got for opening advocating more research into ProgPoW.  Like a bunch of spoiled children demanding something and then abusing it... ruining a perfectly good thing.

These devs, they owe you nothing. And like the thankless mafia reddit trolls are, they bully and troll and threaten and harass the people that actually bring the value to the network... the ones that are trying to grow it, make it more useful, see greater adoption... for what? Disagreeing? Being provocative to spark action? Having morals or scruples? Questioning if things are actually in Ethereum’s best interests? Ridiculous.",19-02-19-04-50,12,3874,Enigma735,arzukp
1700,"> In response the community receives full silence from all of the explicit leadership of Ethereum and from Afri himself.

I don't think he was given enough time to respond before people started raising their pitchforks and he had to go dark.

> Polkadot (via Parity) was given 5mm by the EF

EF's grant was for Eth 2.0 development at Parity and not for Polkadot.

I don't recall Afri pushing for delays that was met with significant resistance. This is a false narrative that has been making the rounds.

> Why have all of the implicit ""leadership"" of Ethereum been so quiet up until now?

The leadership is primarily devs and they are busy building. They can't read every Reddit post. Also things move so fast that if someone doesn't respond within 24 hours it is called ignoring the question and time zones, people taking time off, and weekends aren't taken into consideration.

1703,"*Copy-pasting from a comment I made in the AMA thread:*

I know that the devs have the hardest job. I recognize you're the ones doing the ACTUAL work and putting in the time to build the protocol into what it is and what it will become. I have in the past (and will continue to in the future) defend the devs against the ethtrader hoards who seem to endlessly complain that other people aren't doing enough work to make them money faster. The devs have a really tough job in not only releasing a functional product, but also trying to make everybody happy with this product (which we all know is an impossible goal). You have taken up a challenge which is far greater than most people will ever attempt.

And so with that said, I write the following with the upmost respect for all of the devs, who tirelessly contribute code, both with and without compensation:

This makes it sound like you're in a high school clique, and you don't know and/or don't care about anybody else at your school.

Ethereum isn't a plucky start-up with just a handful participants any more. In fact, at this very moment the market estimates that it's worth $15,247,070,122. There are people who have built entire businesses based on the protocol.

I think it's great that the devs meet frequently, collaborate with other projects, go out for drinks and get to know each other personally -- it sounds like a great way to deepen trust and build community. But the larger Ethereum community is much more than this. There are plenty of people who are equally (if not more) invested in the outcome of the protocol who simply can't attend all the conferences, and therefore miss the ability to make these networking connections, and get to know other contributors on a personal level. However, your words make it sound like these people are second-class citizens. We get stuffed in coach while the devs all mingle up in first class/hang out at a ski retreat.

Obviously, there needs to be some form of meritocracy -- people who can't write code shouldn't insist on contributing code. And code is obviously what fuels this whole endeavour. But -- and I say this as a stern and loving father -- it sounds to me like Ethereum needs to 'grow up,' and realize that the world is a big place, and that the Ethereum community consists of far more than the handful of people who have the time and the ability to attend ETHDenver.

adding on:  in regards to Afri specifically, there are many of us who DON'T know him personally, and so we can only judge based on the public information he presented to us.  Not everyone can make a personal connection with every other individual, so I'm really not sure how else to process the information I'm given.",19-02-19-04-43,42,2236,ethacct,arzrwv

1705,"Excuse me if this has already been answered, but I'm really curious.

Did Afro lock up a significant amount of his personal ETH in one of these damaged Parity contracts?

Just to be clear, I have always supported a solution for these locked ETHs if it ticks off all of the right boxes. So this is not in any way criticism.

But it could clear up the reasons why he was pushing for a solution like EIP-999. I believe anyone with that kind of skills and power would try to go that extra mile to get their personal funds unlocked.

I mean, if this is the case, I can imagine the stress Afri must have gone through in the past few months, it must have been crushing.

I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with it, he's been looking hard for a solution that would benefit all. I ask because it would just explain the situation a bit better perhaps?

It could also help us open up the debate a bit more to keep looking after each other in case of severe bugs affecting those who've devoted so much of their life to it.

Just imagine for a second, Afro having devoted his life to this project, to then him personally not being able to harvest the fruits of it. It's almost like a personal sacrifice, something that can cut deep in a person.

I believe its high time for you guys to analyse why did this happen and if it could have been avoided? If you decide to be stubborn and blame everything on trolls and community it will happen again. You guys gave yourself a very ambitious goal, you are constantly growing in value and reputation, it would be naive to think that you will not get more attention in the future. You should consider creating a safer space/environment to buidl and focus on your goals.

&#x200B;

Its natural to blame yourself and keep saying that you should have done more to defend him, while I think its better to think - I should have done more not to let it go this far. u/mariapaulafn mentioned that this has been going on basically since the parity bug, maybe I dont remember the whole situation, but I have a feeling that the case wasn't addressed so much from ef/parity and created this whole environment for crazy conspiracy theories...maybe the sensible thing would have been after that to let Afri work as contractor...I know hindsight 20-20 but you guys should sit down and analyse what went so horribly wrong for a person to leave because he felt threatened (this is not just for Afri sake) and how to avoid this in the future. Maybe considering creating a PR department who could handle this kind of situations before they escalate or ask Consensys for help...just dont ignore problems and hope they will go away...look at the ama you did recently, 90+% of people there  can be reasoned with, that is your community who stands behind you, but you need to interact with them...not everyone of the thousands out there can go to conferences and meetups to get to know you. Heck I even believe that there were people in the ama that would be happy to buy Afri a beer or 5 and talk about the whole thing to better understand his pov and in some slight drunkennes realise that he is something like a long lost cousin or whatever :).

Another advice, you should look for ways how to remove pressure from you guys...yes you are super smart, talented, strongly opinionated and/or slightly on the introvert side but you are not super heroes!!!...this is just my opinion and I enjoy to listen to your dev calls but do you guys really need public streams? I believe it was Peter S. who brought up a totally valid point that you are under so much scrutiny that you need to triple check everything you want to say so that it won't be interpreted the wrong way, but the thing is if someone wants to stir up controversy he/she will twist your statements anyway, dont give more ammo to your haters...run your usual calls, maybe add every time 1-2 random community members as witness to avoid bilderberger conspiracies (besides the usual introduction chit chat and bla blas, the visitors would be of course muted not to hijack the call with potential bs), post meeting minutes on reddit or wherever, community will talk about it, someone from the devs participating on the call would answer or clarify possible questions in the thread, rotate the devs so its not always the same person answering...I know it might be controversial to drop your public calls but it might be good for your mental health, you would have a safer space to discuss things, joke around, people participating might see you as human beings and maybe feel more involved...not saying that this is perfect approach, it has its flaws...

There should be effort pointed towards innovation regarding an inclusive platform that facilitates creating insights, an overview of who has which interests and how to weigh those in a decision making process. 

Right now it’s a mess! And people get damaged! And when we accept that as ‘that’s just how it is’, the community starts to crumble. We all need each other, we need to find a way to make this work, otherwise we will not succeed. For real. The ideal will die and the people with the loudest mouths and the most money will once again win and take everything.

I’ve been here since November 2017, where everything was just love and hope. Now that we’ve moved into big bucks territory, the tone has changed and people less well capable of combining an investor perspective with a tech perspective have come in. That’s ok.

We need to voice that the way this situation developed and derailed, is not what we are here for. 

We need open discussion and we need to be vulnerable in that discussion. Open about our fears, like DC does when he talks about how he sees polkadot as competing with ETH serenity. And how Afri fuels that fear when he directly states that polkadot is better suited than Serenity, especially from the position he (Afri) is in. 

I don’t want this to be a ‘why can’t we all just get along?’ post. We have to take this seriously and make sure we do better next time. Because otherwise Afri was right about one thing: polkadot is better suited to facilitate a multi chain future, they have that built in from the get go. And ethereum will lose momentum and become a memory of people the were there at the start.

There were a handful of people calling for his “excommunication,” but does that really mean it’s a majority thought or that he should actually leave the community or that those few extreme thoughts spoke for the entire community? I thought the community did a pretty good job having a few really reasonable discussions and dissuading real extreme of pointed comments. 

There are tons of other scenarios this could have played out (he could have started a AMA to engage the community directly and alleviate concerns, made a detailed post that was constructively comparing why he made his statement so Ethereum can get better and change anything if needed, he could have apologized for any misunderstandings associated with his tweet, only stepped down as upgrade coordinator, etc). Those alternatives are still on the table, even though he’s currently taken the most extreme solution. And just because he did so, it doesn’t mean that his decision is only the result of the thoughts of a handful of people (who do not speak for everyone in the community).

Yes I am. I'm also saying devs should be self aware of this when interacting in public. If you put out something that does not explicitly state your intention especially if it is an extreme view, people will take it out of context. Don't give them that opportunity, be explicit, be thoughtful provide your arguments. Don't post ""joke"" memes that most would not realise as a joke outside of a small clique, save that stuff for private channels.

1972,"> An open community isn't one that launches a scorched earth campaign against people that dare say something negative about ethereum.

I absolutely agree that people should feel free to point out flaws and shortcomings with Ethereum, as well as question its future.  However, I think there are constructive and destructive ways to do this.  As 2 examples off the top of my head, both Vitalik and Vlad have previously publicly raised concerns about Ethereum in a way that was truthful, honest, and helpful. 

I think it's unfair and hyperbolic to characterize what has happened here as a 'scorched earth campaign.'  Afri publicly tweeted a meme suggesting that the product being made by his employer was going to surpass the product for which he was currently the release manager.  Yes, some reactions were emotional and over-the-top, but I don't feel it's unreasonable for stakeholders to suddenly question his motives, and ask for clarification when such a brazen statement was made publicly.  In my mind, that's mostly what these last few threads have contained.

If it really wasn't a big deal, it could have been cleared up with a simple clarification, and we could continue debating conflicts of interest rationally and without all this added baggage of emotion.  Instead, he effectively 'took his ball and went home.'  I wouldn't hold it against anybody to take some time to themselves and process all of these events to consider their options, but please understand that going dark does the opposite of inspiring confidence to many who are already out-of-the-loop.

Frankly, without leaning too heavily into the part of 'the grumpy old man,'  I think a lot of prominent folks in the Ethereum community have some lessons to learn about growing up, public relations, and the value of professionalism (the same could be said for a lot those calling for Afri's head on a stick, as well).",19-02-19-04-43,11,2236,ethacct,arzrwv

I don’t think the answer is removal from the community, and I also don’t think the community is the only group to “blame,” if we’re talking about blame (although I don’t think we should think in those terms). 

I also think all of this drama is a distraction for why everyone is here: to give Ethereum to the world. Part of me thinks this could still be avoided by Afri just coming forward and step by step explaining why he said what he said—what I mean is, to reconcile. He could begin with an apology (even if some people don’t think one is needed) for any misunderstanding his tweet caused, and for him to give detailed explanations about why he made his claim (and I don’t mean him saying that he owns equal dots and eth. Instead it should be something constructive about why he got into and still believes in Ethereum, and X and Y reasons are why Polkadot is currently better than Serenity). Because I don’t think that the backlash was caused by Afri per se. It was more of a response out of confusion by the community. For example, confused questions like why is he the Ethereum upgrade manager if he believes this? Why is he even working on Ethereum if so? Those kinds of questions left unanswered results in people looking at only the things they know (Afri’s tweets, his past, where he currently works, etc.). 

I still think there’s a redemption story here for both camps and in the end if Afri cares about Ethereum and it’s mission, a few extreme comments that resulted from his unorthodox approach to engage in discussion shouldn’t keep him from still working with his friends in Ethereum and on the project he believes in. He should clear up the misunderstanding, if there is one, by addressing his critics and everyone hopefully can carry on after understanding things a bit better.

These other communities will use any situation to try and divide, they are not the ETH community that has been accused of malfeasance in the last day or so.   

There needs to be some acceptance that this was poorly handled in many ways (including Afri's decision to make that tweet). What we can do to prevent this kind of behaviour going forward that isn't in a dev vs eth community division. theDAO was truly ugly, things have also changed a lot since then.

2076,"First off, thanks for doing this.

This whole thing was an ugly mess, I wish it didn't happen but it did. However I do feel there was some legitimate concerns during this event. I have touched on a bit here with this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arr7c6/leadership_should_be_held_accountable_to_the/egpzi9s) in response to [mariapaulafn](https://www.reddit.com/user/mariapaulafn) request for input around integrity (which I have replied in the form). It incited the worst of the community and I don't think many devs response was exactly professional in many cases calling out the ethereum community as a whole as being the problem (this was partially self inflicted on Afri's behalf - not excusing the rubbish hurled at him), rather deciding to focus on the fringe nut cases is not useful discourse (this however is!).

I feel there has been a schism for some time forming between parts of the community and devs particularly since EIP 999 etc and lack of real statement from Parity around it's intentions of recovering those funds regardless of what the community thinks (community has to be on the lookout for hidden changes snuck in) is a sore point and I think is mostly the origin for the question of conflict of interest.

That being many in the community saw it as a bail out for people who were close to core devs, where is the line in the sand drawn? Countless people have lost ETH over the years for countless reasons why does Parity get special treatment? This has festered for some time and it seems the tweet was the catalyst for this to blow up (and some of the more insane theories to surface).

A quick reminder just playing devils advocate here on what I've observed.

I believe that Ethereum contributors deserve the right to work in a non hostile environment, not sure how we can provide that online because internet.

I believe providing some COI statements would help eliminate some ""social attack vectors"". When there is doubt that is where the actual trolls get ammunition from.

Basically how do you see that the community could move on from this very ugly chapter? Is there a need for some sort of professional conduct in regards to social media eg. how does the average community member feel about this? how can I present this in a non-inflammatory way? Discussing ideas is fine but tact is required. How to deal with fallout? This AMA is a good step.

We aren't 'a mob' as some have called us. I assume the threats came from less than 0.01% of the community. Tarring us all with the same brush is a little extreme. We are part of the community invested in Ethereum, we want to see it succeed. 

Whether Afri is a bad player or not, this has highlighted an area that we need to work on as a community. He has done a lot for Ethereum but at some point he has developed an undeniable conflict of interest. Whether he was able to balance his interests fairly really shouldn't have been allowed to go on unquestioned. 

A. What happens if another key player has a COI, has the power to sabotage and chooses to use that power? Not having contingencies in place for that is irresponsible. 

Judging by the tweets I've seen today from Maria Paula today, Afri has been unhappy for some time. That was definitely echoed in the controversial tweets that raised COI questions. The fact that he chose to turn his back instead of answering the community makes me wonder if this has been brewing for a while. 

B. Is there a way of improving communication between the wider community and core devs. (This seems like a great start)

The parity name will always be tied to these mistakes simply because nobody on the parity side is willing to move on.

I believe some people in the community need to chill out and give the Ethereum developers a break. 

We've come a long way, and a lot of stuff has been happening, and the Ethereum developers are just as human as the most of us.

The whole Afri situation, overcooked due to Afri being a bit too controversial with his thoughts and opinions, while having a supposed key role in the project. This worries people because of their personal money that is involved.

Is the community attacking the Ethereum team or its leadership? No. Not really.

This is just the community being confused and concerned and throwing everything they can at those at the top.

#The snowflake internet of today

People might find it funny that I mention this, but an added problem is the artificial over-civilization of internet communities nowadays. I'll try to explain that one. Community members are no longer allowed to swear or voice their anger in the normal human way, but instead they are forced to **disguise** their anger in the form of ""arguments"" and ""discussion"".

What types of dicussion? These friendly but passive-aggressive requests and talking about ""accountability"" and bringing up conspiracy theories and shit like that, basically stuff you can't get banned for.

Because everyone is voicing their anger with kind words, these sentences read as very intelligent criticism regardless of its content, and people start upvoting just because it sounds good.

**Result:** The development team reads this stuff and the upvotes it has received, and they'll **get the feeling** the entire community is against them causing an escalation of the situation to be not too far off ( ea. Afri going offline).


So I'd say: Stop it guys. Stop this nonsense. 

# Accountability

Let's not over-complicate things and let's not get into this trap of over-governance and provable accountability and all of that bs.

Ethereum developers really shouldn't have to devote so much of their time to deal with all of this bullshit.

This is what you get with this whole over-civilization of the internet, and the concern-trolling that forms as a result.


# Democratization

**Please let's not fall into this trap of democratizing the entire code development process.** Sometimes technical decisions have to be made that are hard to understand for the general public, but necessary to progress and to complete the bigger picture.

We should not expect from the developers having to explain every single line of code or coding decisions to the entire internet. Internally is enough. 

**Or more worringly, developers could get concerned that an idea they have could be perceived as controversial by the community leading to self-censorship.**

Developers, and Ethereum, need the freedom of thought which is required in these kind of projects.

We should be able to put our trust on the Ethereum development team to do the right thing. 

# Trust

And the Ethereum development team should be wise enough (**without** enforced artificial boundaries, limits, administration) to not misuse our trust.

**Please**, let's not start nor support a whole governance or administration machine that in the end will only slow down progress, and harm innovation.

I support the Ethereum team fully and I trust in them doing the right thing at all times.

2114,"Hey everyone. 

Firstly I'd just like to thank the Devs for all you do. Public figures get so much BS in this field that I have a lot of respect for the thick skin required to be in this position. 

Secondly, I would like to echo several posts here by people like DCinvestor who disagree with the behaviour displayed over the past few days. I had made several posts calling people to chill out and take a deep breath over this issue and I know I was not alone. 

Lastly, I want to apologize to Afri and talk about what I believe led to the issues we've been having the past couple days. 

I believe the biggest problem we have is the lack of good faith and respect we have for those deeply involved in Ethereum. The reality is that Afri has been a longstanding member of the community, and for those who actually know him, have full faith that he is not a bad actor acting out of malice.

Those that were so quick to condemn him for sneaking in EIPs to recover the Parity multi-sig, intentionally delaying the HF, working as a 'double-agent' etc. offered 0 benefit of the doubt to a member of the community who has worked hard and who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

Part of this is ascribed to ignorance. If you only see the bad things, are detached and removed from the on the ground reality (which the internet makes very easy) then you are far less likely to have compassion and understand the critical nuance and context of the situation.

If people had brought up concerns about Afri's conflict of interest without immediately ascribing blame and getting the pitch forks out right away that would have gone a long way to diffusing the situation and having a much healthier outcome. Instead, people rushed to presume guilt and malice and that doesn't leave room for a healthy discussion of any possible issues.

We absolutely cannot be so quick to condemn, based on a partial understanding of facts. This is something we cannot tolerate and is a problem in the greater internet culture in general with echo chambers that can leave us feeling emboldened in our positions. 

I hope that in the future, we are able to call a quorum in the community to discuss the issues in a calm manner without resorting to hasty judgments and possibly even worse behaviour.

2118,"Thanks for doing this. I may be late, and this is more a suggestion than a question, but here you go. I think that the sort of ethical considerations like issues of conflict of interest are thorny enough in well-defined and established genres of human action and production like science, business or politics - how to best deal with them within a high-stakes decentralized innovative crypto-economic open source IT-infrastructure project is a question that nobody has answered yet. Nobody has come even close. So in my book this follows:

\- Let us not forget what this project is not: it is not a business or an established constitutional representative democracy. Expectations and intuitions about what is acceptable and desirable will vary. Screw-ups are to be expected even with the best intentions.

\- Let us try to stay civil. 

\- Let us try to work this out as we go along. 

In the spirit of the last item, I suggest the following: in the next round of grant calls, EF should allocate some money (and, what costs way more, donate some of the top devs time for in-depth interviews) to hire teams of outside ethicists+IT&complience experts (preferably from academia  and preferably already with an understanding of the crypto scene) to do an audit of the accountability of the key participants of the Ethereum project (this could involve all sorts of people, even sub-reddit cheerleaders :-)) and make recommendations.

This shouldn't be (and I don't think it is) an ""us vs. them/community vs. devs"" debate. Surely anyone that saw what I believe was the offending tweet by afri can recognize how just inappropriate it was for a *release manager*. I'm faintly aware he is a longtime contributor to the ecosystem, but I noticed a definite uptick in participation (or visibility) once I started following him on twitter (obviously) and since I think they became (one of?) the release manager(s?).

L.E: Other important things concern me, from which some I already speak out in other posts:

1. What is the ""official"" way to get information about Ethereum? All communications channels used till now are hard to track (especially twitter) and/or full of trolls spreading misinformation either on purpose or lack of understanding
2. Should Ethereum have a PR/communication agency so we don't rely on crypto twitter?
3. [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) as well as [https://ethereum.org/foundation](https://ethereum.org/foundation) don't provide enough information, there are 3 members listed and no way to get in touch with them. (I remember during ETH 2.0 AMA I wanted to shout out to ETH Foundation security lead and couldn't find him...I don't know who the members and their responsibilities are)
4. Regarding ETH Core Dev's and Constantinople, how was ChainSecurity supposed to get in touch with Ethereum? I remember they discovered that earlier. Is it by twitter? If so, to whom? A tweet can be easily ignored. Shouldn't [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) provide the information to report a bug or any other idea?
5. On behalf of Afri who has become the target of some trolls, [why did he needed to be the one to dispel the Ethereum chain size reaching 1TB all alone](https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a)? If it wasn't for him and I wouldn't have run a node myself, how can you dispel the constant FUD against Ethereum, if you have nobody to officially be in charge of such things? Quote from his text: "" *I have been running Parity in 36 different configurations over six weeks to gather the numbers.* ""  (<- Is this what somebody who is against ETH will do with his free time?)
6. Reg the nodes prepared for Constantinople fork, remember all the misinformation again? [Here it is](https://coinrivet.com/latest-under-half-of-ethereum-nodes-are-ready-for-the-constantinople-upgrade/), but also all over reddit, all over crypto media and crypto twitter. Wondering if maybe ETH Fundation should have an official and public way to track it and show the status to everybody? (note: the scrappers on [https://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview](https://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview) were gathering data from nodes which were not running ETH mainnet, so they didn't need to upgrade.

So as a long time r/ethereum lurker and participant, I understood the dev reaction to what took place instantly.

&#x200B;

Many of these people have been presenting their ideas and work together, openly and in person and online each day or week for half a decade. They know each other's families, morals and characters, and how they relate to or differ from their co-workers or orgs.

&#x200B;

What took place was foreign to many that have been around for a while. Hell, at ETHDenver most participants had their jaws half way to through floor, as if they were all offline at an event some other group swooped in in the night and went gangbusters. It just wasn't representative of past experiences, open and honest debates, exchanged medium posts or opinions gathered on calls. It was something else.

&#x200B;

By the way, that's what the recent EIP process had been. While controversial, a group that lost a lot has every right to keep trying and to be respected as long as they're not trying to break the game-board. Put out EIP A, try to build consensus, fail. Put out EIP B, present it at conferences, hold coin-votes, fail. Gauge the community on an appropriate path, try route C, defend selves on twitter, fail... Explore governance changes that please all parties, held debates, TBD. The community presented some regrettable replies, but for the most part had great debates that continue today through governance panels -- like the one we saw this weekend with Hudson, Vlad, Piper, and Zooko.

I think that this point is subtle and more accurate than people could know.  When there aren't mechanisms for productive engagement with key community members on Reddit, the discussion will head in the direction it heads.  Even people like me, who post on Reddit often, are powerless to stop harmful narratives- even if I make post after post discouraging them.

The only counter to them are the voices of prominent community members, many of whom have now eschewed Reddit as a toxic cess pool, and speak often on Twitter of their revulsion towards it.

What we must all understand is that a conversation will happen here whether you like it or not- is it better to be a part of that conversation?  Or to watch it play out and speak disparagingly of entire communities on Twitter?

To that end, the amount of overlap between friendly projects, ideas, staff, devs research and implementations is both expected and incredible.

&#x200B;

This includes well known examples of major dApp teams sharing advisors with ETH Core-Devs, side projects like how [Slock.it](https://Slock.it)'s early work shifted into the DAO or endless later examples of staff or devs spanning projects with similar ideas/researchers that contribute in multiple areas. Even many ops staffers all know each other and might've worked for a few groups.

&#x200B;

Vitalik tweeted a few weeks back hoping that ETH community members wouldn't treat new/legitimate projects like some BTCers treated the Ethereum space.

&#x200B;

So where is the line? For example -- let's look at two types of ""competing projects"".

&#x200B;

1. The friendly group: While they're working on a non-ETH project, a dApp, OR even one that could bridge ETH or have dApp teams try L1 solutions, they're part of this community. A group like Cosmos had OmiseGO and others ready to try out Tendermint at launch, wanted to bridge ETH, AND sponsors Devcon! They bring their whole staff and work to exchange ideas. THAT is what this community was, is, and should be about. When I was at Web3 Summit this year, many of us learned that a prominent member of their community was advising Web3/Polkadot. We can't excommunicate every good dApp, dev, or anyone else that wants to collaborate or that isn't religiously in one camp when dealing with good actors who want to experiment in new ways. Let's just be better tech. So is this the line?
2. The unfriendly group: If a group is hostile to the greater crypto community, or known for trying to buy dev teams or sign exclusivity deals. If they're non-collaborative or share different ideals and not just project names, and they hire core-ETH devs/staff/researchers then yes, this looks funky.

This community has come a LONG way from EF having held all of the dev power. The more independent leadership that props up, the better for the decentralized ecosystem. Should those people have day jobs with an ETH Venture Studio, if they're paid by a major client implementation that works on multiple projects, or other groups -- that feels pretty kosher.

2156,"Thanks for the question. My perspective is that the difficulty bomb forces both devs to upgrade the software and for miners to go along with the forks or risk. Whether or not that is a perfect solution I'm not sure. Some people want to remove it because it sort of forces people to stay on the upgraded chain because the ice age causes transactions to take a long time and mining profitability to go down. Since I'm not involved in this argument a lot I hope someone else comments with a better answer, lol.",19-02-18-21-42,7,13625,Souptacular,arw075
2157,"The difficulty bomb is a method to consolidate power in the hands of developers by forcing people to upgrade to a new version of the software before it programmatically self destructs. They believe (rightly so) that many would choose not to ""upgrade"" if not forced to do so. In other words its like a disease that only a hard fork can cure.

Even though it is a powerful tool to force miners and other stakeholders to act against their own interest (at least in the short term), it creates a lot of pressure to get those upgrades out before everything falls apart. Right now Ethereum is slowing down considerably, and god forbid there is another show stopping last minute bug in the fork its only going to get worse and worse. Despite the power it gives them to enforce their vision, the downsides of this gun to the head of Ethereum is starting to become more and more apparent to developers, stakeholders and community members.

Personally I think it's borderline ridiculous to build such fragility into a decentralized system, when the entire point of decentralization is to reduce failure points. But removing it would be accepting a world where miners would play a much larger role and given that ETH 2.0 is a system where miners basically don't exist, it's a guaranteed stalemate and/or schism along those lines.

2159,"I think both issuance reduction and ProgPoW are very political as well as technical. Both of them are nuanced in different ways. In each case it appears that the core devs are forced to make a final call on these things because there are not other structures set up to decide on controversial decisions that are not purely technical. Additionally the core devs make the code and have to make judgements on what's best for the ecosystem and what the community wants.

For issuance reduction it came down to this: efforts were made to reach out to different stakeholders in the community including small miners, mining pools, investors, and developers so everyone could be heard. I individually reached out to dozens of individuals and held a core dev call with about 30 people from across the different viewpoints to give their views. You can view the meeting video and read the notes to see which stakeholders were present - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2045.md
After hearing all of the viewpoints and waiting around a month to aggregate signals from the community the core devs came to a decision based on what they thought the community wanted. See video of core dev call where the decision was made - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/55

For ProgPoW it is more difficult. This is arguably a bigger change that takes a longer time to gather data, research, develop a spec, code, engage the community, gather signals, and make a decision. The reason it is taking longer is due to higher complexity and being very safe in making sure it won't break things. ProgPoW is much more than just technical because it relies on the assumption that ASICs should be kicked off the network due to risk of centralization.

Hell, at ETHDenver most participants had their jaws half way to through floor, as if they were all offline at an event some other group swooped in in the night and went gangbusters. It just wasn't representative of past experiences, open and honest debates, exchanged medium posts or opinions gathered on calls.

I know that the devs have the hardest job.  I recognize you're the ones doing the ACTUAL work and putting in the time to build the protocol into what it is and what it will become.  I have in the past (and will continue in the future) to defend the devs against the ethtrader hoards who seem to endlessly complain that other people aren't doing enough work to make them money faster.  The devs have a really tough job in not only releasing a functional product, but also trying to make everybody happy with this product (which we all know is an impossible goal). You have taken up a challenge which is far greater than most people will ever attempt.

Ethereum isn't a plucky start-up with just a handful participants any more.  In fact, at this very moment the market estimates that it's worth $15,247,070,122.  There are people who have built entire businesses based on the protocol.

I think it's great that the devs meet frequently, collaborate with other projects, go out for drinks and get to know each other personally -- it sounds like a great way to deepen trust and build community.  But the larger Ethereum community is much more than this.  There are plenty of people who are equally (if not more) invested in the outcome of the protocol who simply can't attend all the conferences, and therefore miss the ability to make these networking connections, and get to know other contributors on a personal level.  However, your words make it sound like these people are second-class citizens.  We get stuffed in coach while the devs all mingle up in first class/hang out at a ski retreat.

Obviously, there needs to be some form of meritocracy -- people who can't write code shouldn't insist on contributing code.  And code is obviously what fuels this whole endeavour.  But -- and I say this as a stern and loving father -- it sounds to me like Ethereum needs to 'grow up,' and realize that the world is a big place, and that the Ethereum community consists of far more than the handful of people who have the time and the ability to attend ETHDenver.",19-02-18-21-42,14,2236,ethacct,arw075

I appreciate that all these folks are human, and to some extent, that is what worries me most.  Humans get power hungry, and are swayed by economic incentives- especially when they are given a common interest and an organization with substantial followership. I'm looking beyond today, to a future in 5 or 10 years, when things may look very different.  That is why I prefer to focus more on articulated power structures, rather than relationships (especially when billions of dollars may be at stake).  And if you want proof, just look at those who have self-ostracized and gone off and started their own competitors.  To my eyes, I'm not sure the evolution of Polkadot is different than these examples, aside from more amicable rhetoric around the split, and continued development support of Ethereum alongside their own project goals.

So how would you classify EOS, for example.  Are they reviled simply because Dan Larimer is not friends with Eth people?  Many in this community had no issue with taking up arms against them.  But simultaneously, many openly support Polkadot (a chain with planned on-chain governance and concentrated token distribution, and also a very lucrative ICO- although as we know, funds were lost).

Is EOS hostile to the greater crypto community?  Or do we just not like Dan Larimer?  What makes EOS bad and Polkadot good?  Is it the fact that Ethereum and Polkadot share a cofounder?  Or that it is developed by Parity- who has supported Ethereum in the past and still does?  Or is that many prominent in the Ethereum community hold DOTs?

I ask these questions because frankly, I'm not sure I can trust any heavily VC-funded chain.  I realize the people at Parity are probably all great people, but that doesn't obviate some of the points I made that they would profit if Ethereum stalled (even for a time).  And this suggestion was perhaps given credibility by the comments of some who chose to directly compare Ethereum to Polkadot as competitors (and it's not just Afri saying that, it's others).

2230,"Copied from my other reaction in r/ethereum ‘it’s a sad day for ethereum’

The difficulty is we have an open network, with many different actors that all need each other, but who’s interests are not always aligned. 

There should be effort pointed towards innovation regarding an inclusive platform that facilitates creating insights, an overview of who has which interests and how to weigh those in a decision making process. 

Right now it’s a mess! And people get damaged! And when we accept that as ‘that’s just how it is’, the community starts to crumble. We all need each other, we need to find a way to make this work, otherwise we will not succeed. For real. The ideal will die and the people with the loudest mouths and the most money will once again win and take everything. 

Besides a tech solution that creates insight and an overview, it’s also about introspection. How can you yourself, get to understand the views of other actors? And how can you show some compassion?

We can draw at least one conclusion: our current platforms of communication (Twitter and Reddit) are not good enough. 

I’ve been here since November 2015, where everything was just love and hope. Now that we’ve moved into big bucks territory, the tone has changed and people less well capable of combining an investor perspective with a tech perspective have come in. That’s ok. That happens when you grow. But we as old school gang, (JT, Souptacular, Nooku, insomniasexxx, DC, Cutsnek, pipebomb and quite a few more) We need to set the tone of this debate. We need to voice that the way this situation developed and derailed, is not what we are here for. 

We need open discussion and we need to be vulnerable in that discussion. Open about our fears, like DC does when he talks about how he sees polkadot as competing with ETH serenity. And how Afri fuels that fear when he directly states that polkadot is better suited than Serenity, especially from the position he (Afri) is in. 

I don’t want this to be a ‘why can’t we all just get along?’ post. We have to take this seriously and make sure we do better next time. Because otherwise Afri was right about one thing: polkadot is better suited to facilitate a multi chain future, they have that built in from the get go. And ethereum will lose momentum and become a memory of people the were there at the start. 

So this is a call to action.

A conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another.  Typically, this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to make decisions for the benefit of a third party.

The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of impropriety. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any corruption occurs.

PoS algorithms simply feel more 'pro-rich' (Can't believe I'm using that phrase) at initial inspection, because in a fairly literal sense, you see money printing more money. The fact that acquiring enough ether to stake and a reliable internet connection is actually in all likelihood a much lower barrier to entry than setting up a truly effective mining operation, especially in a network with viable ASIC miners, isn't immediately obvious.

2286,"Hi,  Reddit newbie here (and lurker until now, I guess!)

From work with several non-profit consensus-based organisations and alliances, I now think that declaration and management of interests is a positive part of effective decision making, not just something negative to be managed (particularly for groups wanting public legitimacy and/or accountability).

(Eg, An alliance of people with overlapping and therefore partly diverging interests can often achieve more than a narrow group of people with perfectly aligned interests).

There are lots of frameworks out there used to declare/manage interests among non profit style collaborations (eg given previous reference in his AMA to academic approaches, see [here](https://theeducationalliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Declaration_and_Conflicts_of_Interest_Policy_2.0_Jan_2017.pdf) .).

But no doubt what’s best for EF will be different, for example due to  primary dev focus (which as you imply, leads to less focus on process/governance), the current stage of development of the whole affair, and not least, the culture and wider ambitions around decentralisation.

Part of the problem is that trust is this fashion is not scalable, and it alone is not sufficient to ensure positive outcomes. While positive outcomes are never assured, understanding people's economic COIs can be informative.  Would you trust Dan Larimer if he offered his assistance to Ethereum in a position of leadership?  Unfortunately, it is inevitable that at least some people inevitably betray others' trust- especially in large complex organizations.  Did you trust Charles Hoskinson at one point?  Would you trust him now?

Even though many of you are great friends, people's situations change.  Trust between you and others is important to do your work.  But people also need to have the trust of the community to serve in positions of fiduciary responsibility.  And even though many will say that Ethereum is just software, it isn't- it's a very important economic network.  Perhaps the most important economic network that will ever been created.

I don't know what the answer is, but having some COI disclosure for folks in positions of decision-making is probably appropriate.  The confidence of this community in the development team is important to the success of Ethereum as an economic network, if not a technological one.  It is not unreasonable for people to understand those COIs, but I do think the EF should ultimately decide who can / can not play certain roles based upon that information.",19-02-18-21-42,14,16074,DCinvestor,arw075

However, leadership positions could introduce COI risk- especially when certain decisions could result in millions of dollars worth of gains for an individual, at the possible expense of Ethereum.

I know, no one thinks one of our core devs would do this, but honestly, we've seen several schisms emerge among Ethereum developers in the past (e.g., Hoskinson, and others).  To assume it could never happen again isn't prudent.  In fact, we should assume it *will* happen again, and try to design development in a way that is antifragile against such events, and situations where the actors may be more nefarious hostile.  That becomes more important as the protocol gains more economic value.

That doesn't mean we need to establish a culture of fear, but one of realism and some degree of compliance.

2370,"Your cost model vastly overstates the attack cost at equilibrium. The reason is that the cost to perpetrate a 51% attack is at least partially subsidized by the rewards available to the 51% attacker while mounting the attack.  

At equilibrium, there is attack advantage because you the attacker are unknown and willing to pay to perpetrate your attack, whereas honest miners will come and go with the economics.  This can be exploited stealthily.

Let's say equilibrium hashpower is K GH/h and rewards are P/day.

If you bring on dK hashpower, gently, the hashpower will increase to K+dK and the rewards to miners will shrink to K/(K+dK).   Over some number of days dT this will cause some miners to be unprofitable and they will leave.  As long as you do not leave, but wait, sufficient unprofitable honest miners -dK will leave and the total will be K again.  You will now hold fraction dK/K of miners.  You will have earned between dK/(K+dK) and dK/K of the rewards dt P.  

Since this was equilibrium, your costs would be dT * P dK/K

So your net costs are less than (dT * P * dK) (dK/K(K+dK)) by about half. 

For small dK that works out to about 1/2 * dT * P * (dK/K)^2 

Bottom line, at equilibrium, a dishonest but patient attacker can take over the network gradually, and be repaid almost all of their costs to do so.

Fortunately for most of us, we have the opportunity to learn this lesson outside of the glare of the public eye, and without being tasked with deploying updates for software worth billions of dollars.  It makes the embarrassment easier to stomach (or it did for me anyways) but the lesson remains the same: words actually DO mean things, and actions have consequences. 

I saw Hudson's tweet that he was angry at the Ethereum community, but I think perhaps that anger is misplaced.  In my mind, the community reacted quite rationally to the information that was presented.  Analogy time:

Let's say that the person who was in charge of launching rockets at SpaceX had been tweeting about how he was unsure about the upcoming changes to future SpaceX rockets, speculating that perhaps they would be unsafe or unstable when it was time for the upgrade to happen.  Then one day, he makes the public declaration that Blue Origin was going to be everything that SpaceX aspired to.  You really don't think that the SpaceX stakeholders would question keeping this person in charge of launching rockets at SpaceX, regardless of what a great rocket scientist he was, or the numerous contributions he has made to the company in the past?   I don't feel like the stakeholders are the people to blame in this scenario -- that lies entirely with the employee who made the completely avoidable decision to publicly state his contrary objectives.

Assuming something positive comes from this, I'll actually be glad for this drama and the way it has played out.  It's certainly shone a light on some of the short-comings and inefficiencies of the Ethereum development and governance processes.  I don't think there's a 'silver-bullet' answer to all of it, but more accountability, transparency, and representation clearly would not hurt.

**EDIT:** I'd also like to point out (as a comparable case study) that Taylor made a few bone-headed mistakes during the MEW/MyCrypto transition, and took a lot of flak from the community for it at the time (and rightfully so, I believe).

\- while ""well thought criticism"" was acknowledged, there were crickets on the point of this ""well thought criticism""...the community was accused of cyber bullying, brushed aside as bag holders and ignored...when you post something on a social media platform with millions of users, you will have a wide spectrum of responses...you(this is not directed only at Afri) decided to focus on the crazy part and ignored the rest...explain what are Afri's responsibilities as hardfork co-ordinator, explain why you think there is no space for coi, what checks/balances are in place for the case not be coi, etc...so many possibilities, you did nothing besides crying witch hunt (this is not to downplay any of the toxic and disgusting responses directed at Afri)

what im most worried is that you (EF/core devs) have a bit of a kumbaya attitude and lack sort of maturity around you, cant help it but to me ethereum sometimes feel like a school project rather a serious research project that aspires to become world computer and disrupt so many aspects of society...dont get me wrong, I know you guys work hard but its not just about working hard. Dont get complacent, dont ignore the signings on the wall (Fred Willson criticism; augur bet about delaying Constantinople or whatever code name it is now - doesn't matter that the bet is about a technicality, it is on the internet- ,etc), grow up and get your act together, there is nothing wrong with bit of a business mentality and maybe consider incorporating some kind of organisational structure...there is lot of pressure on you and I dont envy you that, but this is what you have signed up for, it will be a hard road and most likely get even harder closer to final eth stages and I would hate for a pseudo blockchain like tron or similar wannabe eth killers to win the race, I want to see ethereums potential in the open world!

2432,"Afri stepped down and I'm here to convince you this is a positive result and a worthy first step on the path to clearing some of the corruption we've seen in the Ethereum ecosystem. The sappy part of the ""dev community"" and the various others who have been compromised by their real world relationships with Parity, and/or financial investments in Polkadot, will bemoan the crazy mob and try to make everyone feel guilty for this ""great tragedy"". I think we should ignore them... They're naive and haven't been paying attention to what has been happening beneath the surface.

It's all very simple to understand. Rather than start everything from scratch by forking the protocol, Parity has been poaching talent (see Chainsafe, Aragon, and others) and stealing network effects from the Ethereum base in order to create and drive new converts into an alternate privatized version of the Ethereum ecosystem (Web3 Foundation, Polkadot/Substrate). They've tried to make us dependent on their tech and community services because it makes it easier for them to stage a coup against the Foundation. Their plan, visible in all their actions, has been to divide and conquer us all along; to take as many devs and users away from the Ethereum ecosystem as possible, so that they might one day start afresh as the new defacto leadership.

Afri is merely a symptom (or casualty) of this underlying reactionary movement. There have been red flags and misaligned incentives from day one, and that's certainly cause for concern, but I also think it goes quite a bit deeper than all that. What we have here is a bad actor trying to covertly undermine us from within because of a fundamental misunderstanding of what Ethereum is trying to accomplish. Basically, this bad actor doesn't understand (or, more likely, finds it to be in their financial interest not to understand) that the fundamental protocol (layer 1) must be under public control (or elite control acting in the public interest) whereas the various dapps built on top (layer 2) can have any arbitrary kind of control. Parity wants tyranny, which is private control at the base layer. They can't be allowed to have that. To compare Ethereum 2.0 to this imitation is a mere superficial insult over a glacier of misunderstanding.

I should add that I do think key players in the Foundation realize all this and that their grant to Parity was a feeble attempt to pacify a visible traitor into cooperation. Their leadership style has become more covert since late 2017 so I can only speculate, but I don't think they're as blind as they're letting on. Whatever the case might be, they seem to believe they're above public accountability and can just rule from the shadows or from their ivory tower; as if they can do no wrong; or as if the mob will only get in their way. This approach saddens me greatly. It's a losing strategy, in the end, as this will only weaken the Foundation's credibility and legitimacy. The right approach would be to open the channels of communication and facilitate the voice of as many people as possible. With radical transparency from the Foundation and broad support from grassroots interests we could easily handle these delicate controversial issues.

I find it eminently reasonable to think Parity is aiming for a hostile takeover. They should be treated with the utmost suspicion and carefully excised of influence wherever appropriate. If that means we have to replace a few egos in the process and cause other irritating delays, so be it. We should all gladly accept that as a fair price for creating high integrity software.",19-02-18-11-42,11,86,lntrospectre,arr7c6

2444,"I am not going go into each and every instance of management abuse, where either Management has targeted individuals, creating a hostile work environment, or where management invents new variations of yoga to justify ""how they are perfectly decentralized and representative"".

But I will cite the abuse shown toward Kosala, by Management, and Yoichi, by Management. Both of these individuals were hard working, low profile persons of ethical character. Both got harassed extensively by management. It is a true shame when being a technology developer also requires having a strong grasp of subversive politics.

I strongly, strongly object to rEthereum being about things that are *not* Ethereum. In particular, Parity, MyCrypto, or anything of this nature. These things cloud the discussion, and shift the focus on Ethereum away to side projects, which have differing objectives.

I want rEthereum to be accountable to Ethereum. I don't want the buck to be passed to MyCrypto, and pretend as if ""well, we couldn't stop them from flaring everyone and their mother to promote their products""! Nope. It is YOUR (Vitalik, literally, as he is head dev of this forum) responsibility.

I don't want to have a negative view toward Parity and MyCrypto, which I STRONGLY do, and have that affect my enjoyment of Ethereum.

---

Moderation of these forums is insanely biased. The ""automod"" is fairly ridiculous. For almost a year, discussion of the subsidy was banned topic due to the extreme amount of keywords banned. If it involved Ethereum, it should be allowed. How is discussion of Eth Subsidy banned but Parity, MyCrypto, and everything under the sun someone has to sell next isn't?

Sure, the aggressive mods will tell you it's for this and that - but each removal should require individual, mod ownership of the removal. The use of blacklisting accounts or blacklisting huge swarms of keywords for topics mods don't want discussed is being used to silent dissent.

Mods need to take individual ownership of content removal, and not use a 3rd party bot.

---

The brigading is getting quite nuts, in particular with Parity and MyCrypto. Comments that effectively amount to ""shut the heck up, let Vitalik do what he wants"" get instant +10 AND Gold with regularity, while commenters criticizing management get individually threatened. This is truly absurd. Vitalik sees this, but does nothing.

And Vitalik should be held to a higher standard, because his words and his statements do not agree with the actions of Ethereum - nor does he criticize Eth managers that go against his statements. It's one thing for Vit to criticize BTC, BCH, and Iota... that's weird political sniping, but whatever... it's completely something different when he sells ETH as 'deflationary' or 'decentralized' and the management he installs does everything but this.

That's avoidance - and something unacceptable of management. When he talks, and talks, and talks, about Ethereum but stays silent while the community gets f'd in the a, it speaks. Silence - speaks.

---

Ethereum Foundation, official, is throwing ETH around all the time, often to projects in which the receivers of the funds either sit on the board or are close personal contacts to ETH members.

They keep having something called ""Core Devs"" but often these people decide things WAY beyond the scope of standard development, or bulk community wishes. Why did a 75% vote for 1 ETH get denied? Because of made up reasons decided that day.

Why do certain powerful people get invited, or only select members of the community? Why can the community not elect the people whom it chooses to represent them? Why do the Core Devs always approach meetings with all ""questions"" pre arranged and decided?

I recall watching Casey get shot down hard for merely suggesting the ""Core Devs"" respect the 75% vote for 1 ETH. Why??? How is it acceptable to personally attack only *some* people during meetings? How???

Why does it always tend to be those that favor the will of the community, instead of the inner circle who decided everything before hand?

---

I don't want Hudson telling me to put on the happy face.

I don't want another shill account brigade upvoting some nonsense post about how the community is a bunch of babies and need to shut the little f'ing faces and have an ice cream.

This is absolutely absurd. Truly beyond the pale.

---

We need full scale reform of the decision making process in Ethereum. We need ACTIVE community inclusion. We need to remove the brigades and third party promoters from management, in particular of these forums.

We need to be able to criticize ETH without experiencing years of blacklisting for doing so. EVERYONE in the communities knows that if they criticize MyCrypto or Parity, you will be f'd out of any chance of getting a slice of the multi-million dollar pie, which they are just splitting between themselves anyway.

How is this just? How can Vitalik be so vocal on things that have no importance to Eth, but so silent when it comes to people he knows personally are screwing it up? How can he say one thing, while he knows the managers which he had a hand in installing, or maintaining their positions, will go against all of his verbal statements?

How can Vitalik stand aside while select individuals destroy this community?

I would never, ever, ever buy Afri bucks. But Ethereum *was* Vitalik bucks. What was sold was the personality, intellect, and commitments of Vitalik. What has been delivered has been a side-lined project, deferred into a web of bureaucracy with a lot of beautiful buzzwords but no substance.

We all know the outcome here. More blackballing, no change.

Vitalik, you owe justice to the community. NONE in charge of Ethereum need to maintain their positions, aside yourself and a few others who haven't participated in these hateful brigades and slandering of critics. You've done it yourself, you know better. It is time for all this to stop.

I mean .... Vitalik himself is barely out of school .... and it's hard to expect professional standards from volunteers working for free like Afri apparently is/was doing .... so his childlike handling of the situation I guess shouldn't be a huge surprise.

Perhaps the bigger question is why professional managers and engineers were never hired to do such co-ordination and work, in order to move things forward at a far faster rate (as was certainly possible over the past year or two or three), or at least in a more professional manner. It seemed like at least at one point they had a good amount of money they could have put towards this, but rather all they really seemed to do was offer the occasional ""grants"" .... I don't know now how healthy their financials still are ....

I also have personal experience indicating a lack of professionalism in the people involved .... and that they're really not interested in hiring/building anything like a competent team of professionals to move this stuff forward better ....

Back when I had much more hope for Ethereum, I offered to help on some crucial work which appeared to be lacking the resources you'd assume would be allocated to such an essential part of such a project, and the Ethereum foundation dealt with me with what I'd probably have to label as dishonesty - I would've been totally understanding if they simply weren't interested in my help, but rather, they basically tried to trick me into working for little to nothing, rather than being honest upfront that they simply weren't really looking to pay anything close to market rates, even though I made very clear all along what my expectations were in that regard .... the most charitable reading I could make of their behaviour was ""extremely unprofessional"".

Since then my cynicism regarding Ethereum's future has just grown and grown and grown ... while they don't appear to be the complete clown-show that has been BTC-core for some time now, from what I can tell they're still nowhere close to the professional level that you'd get at any competent tech company / start-up, while I imagine some of the newer coins with much more funding actually being spent on professionally managed teams of paid professionals like EOS etc *are* running at such a professional level.

People on reddit have been complaining since then that there are lots of conflicts of interests here and have expressed worries that people are injecting themselves into ethereum core development that kinda look like they are behaving to undermine the system (similar to what happened with bitcoin)

Additionally, there is annoyance that none of the core devs are commenting on these criticisms, including Afri.

2465,"I feel very sorry for Afri as an individual, but yes there is a much bigger picture at stake here and this unfortunate incident has brought to focus some things that need urgent attention. Here is my suggestion:

1. EF radical Transparency, use the tools eth enables if possible. A) Let everyone see as much as possible of the accounts and where funds are going/managed B) regular updates, say Quarterly about what EF is doing, who works at EF, hirings (and firings), grants, funds management, plans (not tech, the EFs non tech plans) for the year/s ahead (updated every quarter).
2. Institute some sensible guidelines for anyone taking a somewhat formal role in Ethereum efforts. The first being anyone working for EF, the second anyone considered a core dev. These would not be something to be ""enforced"", they would be guidelines that would actually help individuals better understand how to best deal with being in such vaunted positions and is for their benefit first and foremost. At the same time it gives more clarity to them about what the public expectations might be. 
3. Any such guidelines should include that people in such positions would best make a simple clear transparent statement about any possible conflicts of interest
4. Greater communication from entities that people currently look to in times of confusion. Currently EF, but that may change. Maybe ethmagician's will fill some of the void, maybe Molloch related will do something who knows, but today EF's silence is deafening. To be clear I do not mean that we stretch the already stretched shoulders of researchers and dev's, this should no longer be something that Vitalik has to once again step in to help. His voice is hugely valuable/respected. But a simple paid role for someone under EF to on a day to day basis manage communications will be very useful. That role may well require them to hear from the most influential and respected voices to understand the issues better but also needs balanced review of the broader ecosystems stakeholders and to constantly gauge sentiment
5. Support Afri in getting through this personally (even if he leaves the ethereum project), but lets not simply blame ""mobs"", this is ignoring the underlying reasons for such an outpouring of anger (no denying some was  distasteful), instead look to address the underlying problems. A) Hold an AMA about parity/ethereum potential conflicts with senior and respected figures from the 2 teams. B) Don't simply avoid the issue, the big question may well be: Should there be a friendly and effective parting of ways now to avoid a much more painful and difficult splitting of the 2 groups later. 
6. Overall there is a growing perception (eg Fred Wilsons post) and more generally that the Ethereum project is rudderless. its hard to be decentralised and yet give everyone the sense of a strong focused team and clear direction and the balance will always appear to be off, but until today Ethereum has done this better than any other project Im aware of. Today my senses tell me its gone a little too much on the loose side. But surely there are ways to address the shortcomings without having to be more centralised. The suggestions above are done in that light. Greater transparency and communications from EF, voluntary guidelines offered to participants to both help them handle being in such a position as well as set better the expectations on them, voluntary disclosure / statement of any conflict of interests and squaring up to a real serious issue surrounding Parity's relationship to Ethereum and how best to deal with it.

There is a reason a part of the community is wary of Parity's intentions. The situation with Afri and following radio silence on all fronts doesn't help resolve this at all. Also calling anyone criticizing the status quo an angry bag holder, troll, bully and dismissing the community at large with general smugness and or contempt is **really** not helpful. A lot of people are invested in ethereum now, they want it to succeed be it for financial or ideological reasons or both.

When they see someone who has done questionable things in the past, raised concerns that were brushed to the side as nothing, acting that way again whilst in a position that people perceive to have a large sway on the direction of ethereum, they will lash out. Coming from a place of fear that this person is out to damage what they are invested in. Twitter is not the place for this kind of discussion, especially not through a poorly thought out meme.

When you are in a position such as this there is a certain level of professionalism required, it has been lacking for some time. ETH is in the process of moving from a start up type culture to a global platform, the leadership needs to reflect that as well.

There is definitely conflicts of interest at play here and it seems no one really wants to tackle the elephant in the room because it's easier to pretend everything is fine.

I personally think this blew up bigger than it should but it is symptomatic of a larger problem that has not been addressed. It's time for Ethereum to grow up a bit.

2496,Im with you,19-02-18-11-42,-3,7908,mariapaulafn,arr7c6
2497,"I'm not sure I get it. Are people complaining because Afri tweeted polkadot is better than Ethereum 2.0, or because they worry there are ""infiltrated"" EF members working to undermine Ethereum? 

Edit: it is 2am and I really, really need to sleep.  I've now read the whole thread and will share my opinions because I'm worried about some things I've read. Keep in mind those are my personal opinions. I don't speak in behalf of the EF and much less Vitalik, and I have no idea what others think. Also, I'm not sure I understood the issue completely, so, pardon me if I didn't.

First of all, the EF (and in special Vitalik) aren't Ethereum's leaders, the community is. We are your workers. Put yourself in your position of power.

About Afri or ""Ethereum insiders"" secretly plotting to destroy it. I don't know him nor am aware of his intents. But I'm an EF member *openly* plotting to destroy it. Literally, if you read my [ongoing work on Moonad](https://github.com/moonad/moonad), you'll notice my mission is to destroy all things Ethereum does wrong; in special, Solidity. So, perhaps you should redirect all your hate to me instead? I could see myself tweeting ""Formality delivers what Solidity ought to be, change my mind"". I mean, the EF has been supporting opposing ideas since the beginning, and that's one of the things I loved about it. Haven't we even given a grant for Ethereum Classic, of all things? So, I applaud Afri's hypothetical desires to destroy us. If he thinks he has better tech, please, go ahead and do it!

The only reason I'm working for Ethereum is I want to see code being written and problems being solved. We have a collapsing world that needs real solutions to real problems, fast. When you believe you are saving lives in the long run (and I do), you can't afford fighting over team uniforms. That's why I signed up for it: back then, it was sold to me as an alternative to Bitcoin's failure to advance. It used to be the one community that was focused in making progress, not money, above anything else. Did I get that wrong?

Now, if you're an investor worried about Ether's value as a token, then, that's a different (and valid) concern. Keep in mind, though, that Ethereum is a Turing-complete blockchain. That means whatever solution I or Afri comes up to ""destroy it"" can and will be quickly incorporated as a series of smart-contracts. For that reason, I find it very unlikely that anyone will ever ""destroy"" it anytime soon, in the sense of a major MySpace/Digg-like migration event. Its stablished network effect, combined with the fact it is such a perfect sponge of innovation, makes that scenario very unlikely. At least, that's how I see it, but I could be wrong.

Anyway, those are the reasons I'm personally not worried about, and will keep endorsing, anyone trying to ""destroy"" us, well-intentioned or not. I can't speak for the others, but the day Ethereum's ""brand"" starts being more important than pushing humanity forward is the day I quit.",19-02-18-11-42,24,11039,SrPeixinho,arr7c6

""After the events unfolded during this past weekend that resulted on a massive outburst of accusations, conspiracy theories, demands, and verbal violence triggered by **mob mentality**, it is time, as a community, that we take a look at other tech communities and develop our own protocols (in case of abuse of power, harassment), talk about what is tolerable and what we should condemn and in which form, and work on our own procedures to behave as a unified, however decentralized community that has mature protocols and processes to deal with event that might jeopardize people’s integrity, and therefore, Ethereum’s development (eth is developed by humans!)

I think the discussion here has been for the most part been pretty respectful. Yes there has been unacceptable behavior in terms of threats or attacks against Afri in this case. However this was self inflicted to a degree, (this does not excuse the attacks and such on Afri) this was entirely avoidable if Afri has taken a minute to look at it from a different point of view, the view of your average community member.

I think this discussion needs to also entail professional standards and expectations on social media platforms for key contributors, yeah it sucks but it would prevent these types of events in the future and thus reduce the chance of verbal abuse. As others have said I think the Ethereum community is open to discussions of current limitations of ETH 2.0 design if presented in a respectful way, Afri did not do this.

I've seen many robust discussions on here about a myriad of different competitors to ETH and the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to design, strategy and implementation. It's all about having basic tact when approaching it. It's one of the reasons I love reading this sub, but have not really contributed much until this point.

The fundamental problem is that the limited transaction capability can’t absorb even normal demand shocks. 
My sense is that this may require risk taking from aggregators’ part. One possible way is to leverage your zk-snark scaling approach: the aggregator can charge each end user $0.10 per tx (making up numbers here for the sake of illustration) and guarantee such tx be confirmed on chain within 10 minutes. Let’s say zk-snark can wrap 500 transactions in one big transaction costing the aggregator $10 under normal gas price. So aggregators can pocket $40 ideally per such operation. But aggregators can also lose money if gas is high and/or there are few transactions aggregated within the 10 minute interval. ",19-02-18-10-18,3,21,mrnobodyman,arqfau

A client created for such a solution could be set up to provide the necessary transaction information _minus the actual authorization_ to a service during a window prior to this post. Fees can also be dynamically adjusted if desired. 

The service can then take the other side of the off-chain transaction amounts from many people simultaneously and post to the chain. This would be done simultaneously to all clients at a fixed time in the window, which would then make the client authorize the transaction.

On layer one, as this is a single transaction, it can be done at a normal or even high-speed value. On the layer two side, multiple entities are paying for a known transaction time, which reduces costs and may even allow such a service provider to pull a profit on each transaction. Obviously, volume is critical, but likewise, as volume increases the time window for each cycle can shrink. ",19-02-18-10-18,2,10293,uetani,arqfau

Then you can enter the secret words and bid amount and proceed on with the reveal.

Take part in one of the myriad aspects of building Ethereum and developing it into a scalable, usable, well-functioning, wide-spread ecosystem. The ridiculous thing is that you will ""generate more money from ETH"", AND you will have a lot of fun while you're doing it.

2645,"You could deposit your Eth into trade.io and exchange it for TIOX. With the TIOX you can contribute it to the exchange's Liquidity Pool and earn interest on it. Trade.IO is a new exchange which had their ICO in Nov 2017 and has been up and running paying out for most of 2018. 50% of the exchanges profit goes to the liquidity pool participants of which they've paid out $188k since going live. You can also trade crypto on their FX market and buy crypto with a credit card. Trade.io are aiming to become THE crypto investment bank which will not just have crypto, but also FX and commodities. It does not seem Ponzi like in any way, especially since they don't promise ""huge returns"".
They are transparent, continuously building and onboarding new coins and have reliably paid out daily. At this point their volumes are still low so profit is low but at the numbers we already have you can expect between 1% and 10% yearly profit depending on the tier you fall in based on the amount you deposit. This can go much higher with more volume on the exchange.

I'm into it (in fact, it's like 90% of my portfolio) and to be quite honnest it's the ONLY reason why I haven't been annihilated by the crypto winter. In fact I'm still up like 4x in *USD value* compared to when I got in a year ago. I also sold about as much last August on top of that.  
Now I understand it's easy to be scared bt the ""pyramid aspect"". But here are some technical facts:

-It's decentralized. No person is handling your money at any time ever.

-It's open source, which means anyone can look at the code and see *exactly* what it's doing, what the functions do, etc. If you can't read code, you can watch some videos of people explaining it line by line.

-You don't only get dividends from buys, but also from *sells*. Which unqualifies it as a Ponzi and is one of the main reasons it's still active.

-It can't be taken down and is going to run for as long as the Ethereum network lives.

-It has been copied dozens and dozens of times, and *every single one of them* turned out to be a scam : pre-mines, skewed dividends ratios, or just litterally `giveEverythingToOwner()` functions in the contract, you name it. But the original is still going strong and zero failure point has been found.

Now, don't get me wrong I was lucky to find it pretty early on and percentage wise I've made a killing, so I could be a little biased. And it's still a zero-sum game so for someone to gain, someone else has to lose. But I think that honnestly, if you want to get ROI from your Ether like you'd do with a rental property or dividends from shares, and you're feeling a bit lucky (it's still a game and was never advertised as an investment platform), this is pretty much one of the only options available.",19-02-18-04-25,-1,281745,OlivierDeCarglass,armnwp

If volume were to go to zero for an extended period of time, for any market, for that window of time then the market value has been totally devalued, up until the point where volume picks back up. 

As with many things, (beanie babies, Pokémon cards, etc) the value is in the speculation. P3D is an exchange which issues ethereum tokens and happens to pay out a % of all buys and sells to everyone that holds tokens. It’s that simple. Check https://powh3d.hostedwiki.co/pages/FAQ#is-powh3d-a-type-of-pyramid-or-ponzi-scheme for more info. The project has operated for nearly a year, exactly as described and with 100% transparency.

So if volume goes to 0, everybody simply has the tokens they purchased. Which, perhaps they might want to sell - thus creating dividends again and lowering the token price. Which then encourages people to buy again - creating dividends!

High speed data over radio has quite the limited range, usually requires licensing (or dealing with super high noise floor in unlicensed bands), and would really benefit from efficient/directional antennas at high altitude.

But urban environments are the only place this makes sense, as you point out.

It would be instructional to speak with the people who run Wireless ISPs in your city to see what kind of range they get and the challenges they face. If you have trouble finding a wireless isp in your city, it's because they are only practical in a few high density cities.

2790,"I don't know what the reasoning that the original designers had was, but IMO there are two main positions I subscribe to in this debate:

1. The primary goal of Ethereum has never been to boost the price of Ether. It's a *secondary* goal, sure, but only because it will be helpful toward Ethereum's primary goal - being a secure, distributed, trustless smart contract platform. Higher Ether price boosts Ethereum's security, that's the only real reason to be concerned about it.

2. Quibbling about little details of issuance has very little impact on the price of Ether at this point anyway. It really doesn't matter much. If you look at the price charts over time you'll see that Ether rocketed to its all-time high and plummeted back down again with no change to its issuance model in that period. And that when an issuance change did happen it had no discernible effect on the price.

I'm not an analyst, but it seems pretty clear to me based on how Ethereum's price rises and falls in lockstep with the cryptocurrency market as a whole that it's really changes in *demand* that lead to significant changes in price. So if you really want to work toward boosting Ether's price for whatever reason, the best way to do that is to work toward increasing the demand for Ether. Boosting its utility is a good way to do that, getting it used for new applications so that people need Ether in order to get stuff done.

I don't think that's true per say. Any sound money needs to have a \`store of value\` proposition otherwise people will not have any inclination to keep it and will only spend it. That's not how money works. Even right now, people have money in their bank accounts.

I think the exponential decreasing curve is too steep, and BTC is a special case in itself as it 'led the way'. It's a victim of it's own success in that sense. There was no possible way to know but it just seems massively disproportionate now given that early block rewards were 50 BTC when it was worth nothing and now it's changed ridiculously. It is a good store of value I agree with that, but as 'cash' I'm not sure. For example personally I want to have a bitcoin that I can just 'store in my basement' in the digital sense.

I guess this is where, in my (not comprehensive) understanding, the impossible balancing act comes.  As you said, it needs to have the store of value aspect, but people also need to want to spend it. If someone owned gold today they would just be holding it, that's how I would personally view any BTC holdings I had.

Part of it is just psychological too, 21m is really not a lot given the number of people in the world! All I was getting at was that I think that some inflation isn't bad as there will be 'growth of user base'. Perhaps I'm looking at it in a simplified way, but the best way I can explain it is using an example of 'consumable commodities' - foods and fuels etc we generally hope/expect will always be within the 'affordable' range for your average person, because there will be an increase in supply as well as demand (something I've just thought now writing this, this could be compared to eth's 'flexibility' in adjusting issuance). So in theory following this the value will grow as it's being used more widely but not so much that people won't want to use it.

&#x200B;

Off the back of that is then the question of what might be better in terms of 'investment value' if it's considered that - holding something for scarcity or holding something because you feel there is going to be enough adoption to increase it's value despite some inflation!

In such a case an assessment should be made like this:As ASICs are more efficient (like 2 times) it suggests less power and resource consumption and the figures should be normalized as follows:

Total Resource Consumption = 70+(30/2)= 85 unitsTotal Resources Ready = 75/85= 82.2%Maximum Resources Not Ready = 30/85 = 17.8%This analysis is based on the fact that in a PoW network (believe it or not Ethereum is PoW) it is not the hashrate that secures the network but the resources that are being consumed do this.So, the hard decision would be about losing 17.8% of network security instead of 30%, a much easier decision to make.Obviously, it won't be that easy because this community is regularly targeted by Bitmain shill and trolls and prominent figures like Vitalik do not weigh on ProgPoW because they are busy with their ""roadmap""  and don't want any ""distraction"". So, it seems to be more likely that ASCI shills this sophisticated game and everybody would be happy other than the majority of miners.Not a prophet to foresee the consequences but I bet they won't be very good.",19-02-17-10-21,1,71,aliashrafD,aredki

2881,"The economic signal of the Big Pharma ""treat symptoms not solve"" approach being the path of least resistance tells me:

1. Developing cures is much harder and more costly than symptom treatments.
2. There is far more money to be made by ignoring cures and prolonging disease as you say.

To be blunt, the latter being the core problem and society just letting it happen would be extremely fucked up, Hitler 2.0 level shit, but I think the former is the core problem.  There is probably a lot of the latter though, but I hope lack of tools/resources and ineptness is more the issue as opposed to calculated evil.

I've grappled with understanding this myself based on direct experience (see Disclaimer below).

Another reality is that until disease starts to affect more people instead of less (perhaps climate change dynamics and over-population downstream effects will cause this in the coming decades), the average person just simply doesn't care about this horrid issue :( as you can see evidenced by the low comment interest on this post thus far.  By the time most people have diseases, they're old enough to not care so much anymore anyway, ""I've lived my life and now I'm tired.""  So the remaining people are just unlucky ones and that's it.

Disclaimer: I was diagnosed with ICD-10-CM G90.59 at age 25, 4.5 years after symptoms began, deep into advanced ""suicide disease"" as its often called.  There were a lot of reasons why it took so long, but this is pretty typical from what I've discovered.  Part of the delay was my fault in not considering my full lifetime injury history as opposed to strictly events around the time the chronic pain began, but it's obvious in retrospect things like getting blasted with CT and x-rays a few too many times in a short timespan contributed to advancing the problem.  There's a lot more to my story but that's the most critical general aspect of my perspective on the world.  The MDs are almost completely lost beyond the most basic or common diseases at this time.

These points are dismal, but I'm hopeful in the back of my mind that ideas like you put forth will help fix the broken system for future generations.

EDIT to add something more constructive to cjdew's topic scope:

It all seems to be a massive quagmire regardless of how the funds for fruit-bearing research are raised/paid, but I think optimizing the incentive mechanisms definitely wouldn't hurt.

A big problem is the unknown unknowns.  A research study (even a sound one) can only do so much to understand what's actually going on because of the cost and limited tech.

For instance, sure I'm a case where whenever I pop even a low dose of Neurontin after letting the pain rein free for a while, it has a ridiculously helpful effect within two hours, when usually the benefits don't happen so fast at such a small dose for the average patient.  That's great except for the problem that the body adapts quickly in difficult to quantify ways and it basically becomes the whole progressive tolerance into ineffectiveness bs and you have to just stop taking the drug for a while, and then you get to have fun with optimizing the withdrawal.  There are cases of treatments that help in some ways but then screw up a bunch of other stuff, and sadly this is much more the norm than the exception with all the wall of text side effect warnings.

If MD culture can shift toward quantifying, appreciating, and preferring natural algorithms as the first line, that will help weed out the more easily solvable issues and reduce the burden they have to focus on the harder problems.  When you read about all sorts of ""natural deficiencies"" like more than 50% of First World people are deficient in critical things like magnesium, this is basic step one stuff.  The problem is natural algorithms that heal/cure are easily open sourced and can't realistically be sold for massive marginal profits, so the incentive isn't there for researching what natural algorithms work except for the patient experimenting themselves out of desperation or simply getting no long-term effective help otherwise.  And then you get all the people who do try to peddle natural algorithms, some of which work, some don't, some dangerous, and it's just a huge mess of trying to dig for signal in the noise.

The cost of synthetic treatment research compared to the lack of safe cures for much of anything as a result is really lame.  The biggest problem is there are so many variables and the MDs have only a few tools to measure a small set of them at this time.

The basic goal as I see it is we need more tools to *safely* and much more frequently monitor the parameters of the human body and the parameters of the external world state that affect the human body over long periods, not just short periods.  These noisy data streams can be analyzed with data science to find what objectively measurable patterns matter and correlate with subjective sign/symptom patterns.  Then we can more efficiently try to tweak and develop treatments/cures.  But clearly the key word *safely* is non-trivial (or in the least not cheap) or we would see this happening more quickly.

Perhaps the hardest part is that the human body has a set of common traits, but then a lot of traits that vary vastly from person to person.  Having tools to monitor everybody's ""parameter sets"" frequently overtime is really the only thing that makes any sense.

The future of medicine is going to be prevention by knowing what is going on inside and outside the human body sufficiently, and thus saying oh, just avoid the carcinogen X that is in environment Y instead of slowly developing cancer by unknowingly being silently exposed to carcinogen X over time.  Reality will be more complex than simple answers like that most likely, but it would be nice if God or the rules of the universe would give us a break and show that a lot of complex issues are simpler than they seem.

In the worst case we're hitting ""impossibility"" limits, but I doubt that.  I think we're just starting to scratch the surface on effectively monitoring what's going on.

&#x200B;

""Curation markets allow us to harvest the best ideas in an open market — an innovation that pharma desperately needs. This is why we are building Molecule, a software platform to accelerate innovation. At its core, it allows participants to distribute and crowdsource chemical intellectual property, ranging from drugs to delivery methods, to combinations of chemicals. IP owners can relinquish partial ownership of their innovation in exchange for access to liquidity, research and funding in an open market. This creates new markets for research and development, as anyone — academics, corporations, investors, patients — can signal support and allocate resources by purchasing shares in the development of a specific drug.   


Owning a share of a compound has two distinct effects: first, it provides an incentive for researchers to create and publish both positive and negative data about compounds out in the open, accelerating innovation. Second, it provides legal rights for anyone to do so.   


In our vision, innovation can become self-enabling and sustaining as the original creator distributes ownership of the IP. The IP is owned by an autonomous market maker that distributes ownership based on demand and supply, using a token bonding curve.""

2889,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this topic and continuing the discussion.  I don't have a suitable answer for ""what we should do"" to address these issues, but I do know that if we can't openly discuss them and what they might mean, then Ethereum faces a higher likelihood of being captured by corporate (or other) interests at some point down the line- perhaps being rendered compromised or irrelevant as a result.

As a community-driven, open source software development effort, community voices matter.  As we have seen from fervent ""shilling"" rife on crypto Reddit and Twitter in many communities, there is incredible power in economic incentives in driving individuals' behavior.  But sometimes, those voices may be speaking from a place of conflicting economic incentives (a condition which I agree is difficult to ameliorate satisfactorily)- and this does not just include folks from Parity.  Indeed, I suspect (and know for a fact) that many of the influential Ethereum community members invested in the Polkadot ICO.  It's hard to state what affect this might have on the conversation around Polkadot as a possible competitor (or ""partner"") to Ethereum, but I can assure you that it does have at least *some* effect.

I am in no way advocating for a ""Salem Witch Trial,"" but should core developers or those in positions of influence over Ethereum openly disclose their holdings and potential conflicts of interest to a Foundation Compliance Officer as a starting point (for private review, not public disclosure)?  I don't know, but maybe.  This would frankly be in line what leaders in organizations who make financial decisions are often required to do.  I realize some may see this as invasive, but the community is putting trust in these leaders.  Should there be some degree of controlled transparency to ensure that they are not subject to possibly conflicting economic incentives which might hurt that community?  Should someone with conflicting, overwhelming financial interests in a competing project be allowed to hold leadership roles on it?  If they are, might there be other ways to ensure that they are independent or have appropriate oversight?

I don't know the answers to any of these difficult questions.  But I do know that if this network ever comes to be valued in the trillions of dollars, the scrutiny behind these types of situations will only get stronger.

As one of the guys that voiced a more critical opinion on Afri on r/ethtrader I would like to clarify that... 

I have no problem whatsoever with Afri (or any other dev) working on several projects at the same time. Most interesting ideas lie at the crossroads of different projects/fields and devs that work in multiple projects will be there to pick them up and bring our attention to them. 

I have no problem with Polkadot or Parity. I like the job they have done with Parity client and find the approach to scaling taken by Polkadot interesting. I wish them success for the benefit of the ecosystem.

I have no problem with anyone raising criticism on Ethereum and bringing attention to its shortcomings, in fact I welcome it and promote such discussions. 

I do not have a problem with other coins. Economy is not a zerosum game. Multiple projects can be successful and their strength contributes positively to the ecosystem.

I do have a problem with Afri attempting to push in a very surreptitious way changes to the Ethereum protocol that had been amply criticized by community and experts. Looking only for their self-interest after they lost their funds.

I do have a problem with Afri promoting a change that will result in a schism of Ethereum during its transition to PoS. PoS being a fundamental part of the Ethereum roadmap since the very early days.

And I do have a problem (albeit smaller) with low effort trolling and FUD. If you think Polkadot is better than Ethereum 2.0, write a medium/reddit post detailing why. Sending a twit saying Polkadot is everything Ethereum 2.0 was set out to be but better, as the technical guy working on Ethereum for Parity... is just low, provides no constructive value and serves to seed FUD.

But, I think this post is missing the main point of criticism that has arisen lately, which is that the leader of Ethereum's upgrade schedule should not be someone with a) conflicting interests, b) who openly goes against the wishes of the majority of developers and stakeholders, and c) repeatedly promotes delay tactics and purposefully introduces issues that diverts from the main agenda. The leader of Ethereum development should be someone that's wholly dedicated to Ethereum and has the highest possible project management, and ethical attributes.

2910,"You made a lot of references to “Ethereum” without actually defining what “Ethereum” is. 

There’s really two choices here:

Either “Ethereum” is basically a mob mentality to call this thing “Ethereum” and that other thing not “Ethereum”.  In other words, it’s genuinely decentralized, and mob mentalities are not only to be embraced, but are the actual source of strength and true definition of the project. 

Or “Ethereum” is what the EF says it is, and the leadership of the EF is therefore the leadership of “Ethereum.” For all intents and purposes it’s a centralized organization masquerading as something decentralized. When in reality we all know who’s in charge and they define and revise the “roadmap” with near unilateral power. 

You seem to want it both ways, and that’s naive and unrealistic. The “Bitcoin schism” happened because BTC was genuinely decentralized and leaderless - it was and continues to be a truly decentralized mob mentality.

2921,"Upvoted you. You and I have less to disagree about than you might think. I'm completely for using this current situation to revisit our stances and question certain parties about theirs. Let's use the example of Afri as our example. As we know, Afri has come out in opposition against the current Eth roadmap. It's worrying, yes, for a dev working on core parts of Ethereum, but it's very far from criminal.

A research project thrives from being tolerant of divergent opinions that inspire new paths forward. It's not a problem in itself that Afri disagrees. It's a problem if he continues to disagree and repeatedly holds up development due to his disagreements. In my opinion, we haven't seen enough of this behavior yet. All we've seen is him disagreeing.

If I were Afri and I found that I had serious disagreements with the roadmap, I believe that the first steps of ethical behavior is exactly what he did: state publicly his opinion. This puts the disagreement out into the open and prevents exactly the kind of conspiracy that people are worried about. It's because Afri was so transparent that we're having this discussion. If he really wanted to screw us (the community), he would have kept it to himself and continued sabotaging Ethereum from the shadows.

Continuing this hypothetical, if I were Afri, I would have open dialogue with other members of the community, including core devs, possibly posting a couple Medium articles tracking the change of his thought process. Meanwhile, I would continue my work while agreeing to disagree when possible while abstaining from work that goes against my beliefs. After a period of deliberation and well-intentioned efforts of outreach, I would make a decision about whether to continue in the community.

Afri wouldn't be the first person to leave. Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, and many others moved on from working on the core team because of differences in opinion. Yoichi Hirai, for example, stepped down as EIP editor for ethical disagreements. Good for him and Afri as well if he chooses to leave. It's within the spirit of the blockchain community, a community which has built in mechanisms to fork.

I use Afri as an example because there's more reason to be skeptical about his continued participation than with Parity as a whole. Again, Parity runs the second biggest node software and has real people working their full-time job to keep the lights on at Ethereum. Saying that Parity has been screwing things up to secretly favor Polkadot over Ethereum is a serious accusation, and the burden of proof falls on the accusers, who all don't nearly have the same track record for giving to Ethereum. It's one thing for Vitalik to come out and doubt them. It's entirely something else for a random group of strangers online to do so.

I get that we all care about Ethereum a lot, and it's easy to come up with these theories when things go bad. However, we shouldn't throw out centuries of history and experience in due process just because we're swayed by the passions of the moment.

Another: (https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/02/02/ethereum-developers-spend-an-hour-on-deciding-how-to-decide) it does not seem that the Ethereum developers have learned much from the Constantinople fiasco: "" In the last call, a month ago, developers decided that dev calls were not the proper forum to make a decision on ProgPoW. Yet effectively all of yesterday’s dev call was spent on ProgPoW. ""

In fact we had created an example contract that was vulnerable. We thought this was evident and well-known.” Sergio Damian Lerner further stated that many Ethereum Devs was part of this discussion and, “I was sure the devs knew. And I’m still sure. Probably no useful contract will break in practice. But they decided to redo the risk assessment 36 hours before the fork.”
So yes, this debacle was completely avoidable and its not the first time it has happened. Anyway, lets hope this is lessons learned.

Polkadot is solving ""There are all these different chains that have cool properties, but it's hard to secure them all, and they can't talk to each other"".

Bridging Ethereum to Polkadot is basically guaranteed at this point. They are competitors in the same sense that C and Python are competitors because they are both programming languages: technically you can build anything with either, but there are tasks that are naturally a better fit for one or the other, and it turns out they complement each other well.

Healthy Ethereum means that dapps that decide that EVM or eWasm and gas prices for normal operations are too much of a constraint, and would rather have their own chain with their own runtime logic can build a Polkadot parachain, while still being able to interact with existing and future dapps built on Ethereum. Ethereum being connected to Polkadot suddenly means you have the access other way around, as well as secure bridge to other existing stand-alone chains, like Zcash.

3058,"The following is overly nebulous/general and preaching to the wise choir, but as a principle competition is good in the long run.  What works will be discovered, what doesn't will fail.  There is room for multiple ""successful"" solutions, but historically the complicated nature of balancing centralization vs. decentralization often ends up with power law distributions of competing solutions (power law distributions are a hallmark sign of centralization).  This just means that there are a few solutions at the top used by everyone while every other competing solution ends up ""sharply failing to be in the majority"".  Whether solution centralization or solution decentralization is preferred is a matter of what our objective function is in a given ""solution seeking space's"" scope.  Decentralization of solutions is hard in a capitalistic system because of the ""fuck everybody but myself"" modus operandi of the average person.

The key for efficient invention/discovery is for those who fail to relentlessly get back up and keep tinkering.  More important is to adapt and support what works and leave behind what fails---to not get overly attached based on political bullshit.  It may suck to the average person's wishy-washy mindset, but humans have an incredibly difficult time building solutions in an optimal manner working as a group because of difficulty communicating what's really going on (there are reasons for this that won't be quantified for centuries to millennia, so it's semi-pointless to even bother trying to think about why at this time, let alone how to fix/reduce that problem).  That process is what really defines ""work"" in modern times.  This is why every data stream you measure on human group endeavors looks like perpetually drunken chaos.  The ""work"" process of finding the sufficiently optimal solution(s) is chaotic and fraught with risk everywhere since humans are extremely fallible and fuck up all the time because of Murphy's Law.  No matter how smart you or your group is relative to others, Murphy is always a step ahead of you.

Issues like you raise here are just par for the course to anyone who is anti-wishy-washy and understands human nature, but that being said, what you're doing with this post is providing significant value by helping push competing solutions to talk about something useful, economic incentives that ideally transcend any single competing solution to help all the solutions as a whole, regardless of who ends up on top.

*But it does question Parity's incentives,* as a firm who is actively (and perhaps primarily) now developing a blockchain other than Ethereum.  I stand by my analysis that Polkadot would benefit from Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0 ceding potential market share through delays.  Delays would not necessarily cause Ethereum to fail, but it could cause it to lose network effect and developer mind share.  Such delays would not require obvious sabotage, and could instead manifest in very insidious ways if key actors were intentionally malicious (or even subconsciously, perhaps unknowingly affected by their own financial incentives).

The entire Polkadot product is designed to enable the creation of other chains, and its primary value proposition may ultimately be that those other chains can connect to Ethereum.  That is more of a value proposition for those other chains and for Polkadot than it is for Ethereum.

And saying that much of the work that Parity does for Eth 2.0 can also be reused for Polkadot isn't adequate incentive to ensure that Parity does best job possible for Ethereum.

Again, I'm not evaluating intent, I'm just evaluating incentives.

Except in this case, economic activity that is likely to occur on Polkadot or other chains (especially early on) is activity which might have otherwise occurred on Ethereum.  There is a chance that Polkadot productively increases the size of the pie for everyone with incredible and unique capability which makes the whole blockchain space more useful in ways that Ethereum alone could not have, but right now, I'm not seeing it.  If you have concrete examples of what this may look like, I'd be interested to hear them (especially use cases which could not be delivered as Ethereum L2 or under Eth 2.0).

Why not just use Ethereum L2 then?  Or even build a product on top of an Ethereum L2, like many of the dapps launching on Loom's PlasmaChain?  Some of these L2 projects are launching with their own consensus mechanisms (like DPoS).

By creating conditions which encourage development on other chains (you don't know in what ways they will do so) before Eth 2.0 launches, Polkadot will be doing exactly that (i.e., fragmenting it).  Whether that is Polkadot's intent is not something I can evaluate, or even care about.

This makes Ethereum more valuable because it provides a greatly expanded access to the public network to groups who would otherwise not bother building a system direct to the public network. Open access allows Ethereum to become a center of the blockchain universe, assuming it is indeed the best L1 solution suited for that task.

The day that Metamask finally released hardware wallet support was huge, because you could finally interact with dapps from your Ledger/Trezor wallets without trying to sync out a full node and run an Ethereum-specific browser.

Think about that. Metamask (as far as I know) is literally the only solution here, and they're not even a part of the core Ethereum project. There's no alternatives. It took them a very long time to add hardware wallet support, and these features are critical for making the dapps usable.

3146,"I am ""hung up"" on Ethereum being the winner because I understand the value of a network effect.  Fragmenting activity among many public chains at this stage doesn't seem particularly wise, even if there is some degree of interoperability.

Polkadot is now labeling itself as the ""foundation of a new internet.""  Ok, well, what does that leave for Ethereum, which effectively had a similar goal of being the ""world's shared computer?""  If Polkadot were to step up and say ""Ethereum will be the world's shared asset ledger and we will provide connectivity to it for private chains,"" for example, then this would reinforce a key value proposition for Ethereum.  So far, I don't see Polkadot reinforcing any of Ethereum's core value proposition.  Rather, their best claim seems to be ""you can interoperate with Ethereum when you need to but ignore it when you don't.""

You act like there is no way to achieve interoperability between private chains and Ethereum, but this is not the case.  EEA was create with the ultimate goal in mind of having private chains connect to the public chain.  Mechanisms like Plasma L2 may provide similar functionality.  And they are already creating bridges to other networks (like Loom has to Cosmos) without needed to operate as a separate L1 solution.

Finally, I (and many others) believe that ETH must be a form of money to be successful for important economic applications.  If DOTs start competing with ETH as a smart contract platform currency (as I believe they will attempt to because DOT holders will want to act in their rational economic self-interest), then I consider that to be a problematic outcome.

As I said earlier, I don't mind Polkadot being an Ethereum competitor, but I do not mind pretending it isn't a competitor by saying things like ""it will only expand Ethereum's functionality,"" because that is false.

May I also remind you that, while <insert any GH repo> there’s a specific issue open, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the issue is in release, like yours.

Found and patched may not *always* lead to the best outcome. There are often plenty of reasons to do a closed release for critical software in businesses that highly depend on there not to be issues (e.g. exchanges). I do not claim to know much about your specific issue, but I wouldn’t brag too much about “we fix and release like a boss”. It’s good that you fix the issues you have, but it’s better to ask yourself: how come I have them in the first place?

Now, and I’m fairly certain you are well aware,  you are developing critical software in which any individual may loose millions because of an issue (Happened in the past).  I highly recommend that you think careful and take a lot of consideration when disclosing issues like these. Fixing your issue and announcing for an upgrade is one thing, but consider the possibility that people may not be able to upgrade or miss your announcement. You mean well, I’m sure. 

I guess what I’m saying is, never downplay issues. Never brag about how quick you fix issues. Don’t brag about disclosing issues, shit like this may bite you in the ass in the end of the day. Humbly apologize and move on, learn from your mistakes and don’t feed the trolls.

If you deploy strictly with CREATE and ignore CREATE2 your contracts are going to be completely unaffected in their functionality.

But if you're only a taker, why do you need to give approval? Why can't you just send a taker transaction which also transfers the given amount of tokens?",19-02-15-09-03,1,1436,PolarOne,aqp9gw
3446,"Ah yes, I understand your confusion! 

You see, if you transfer an ERC20 token you (the user) has to send a transaction directly to the ERC20 token contract. Now let's say you want to trade this token on a DEX (another contract). To let both the transfer and the trade happen in the same transaction this means that the ERC20 transfer has to call into the DEX in order to transfer tokens AND trade at the same time. It is not possible to pack two of these operations in the same transaction (where transaction is when metamask pops up and wants you to confirm a transaction).

ERC20 token contract do not, by specification, call into other contracts. However, [ERC223 tokens](https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard) do! If you transfer tokens to a contract (the DEX, for example), then it calls `function tokenFallback(address _from, uint _value, bytes _data)` where `_from` is the person sending the tokens (you). To include data like the price you want to sell your tokens for and the type of token you want to trade for can be put into `_data`. Of course, `_value` is the amount of tokens transferred. This calls into the DEX and will create an order for you / fill an order!

In essence, anyone with a lot of coin can influence the vote, but that doesn't mean the technology isn't sound or needed. It is really a shame this vote was created at all. It effectively serves no real purpose other than to split the community down a line that is arbitrary.

&#x200B;

The fact is that ethash (the current PoW) has worked well for 4+ years, but chip technology has caught up and the threat of ASICs are real. If ETH wants to stay GPU centric, then something will need to change in order to ensure that. Having ASICs control the network is something that the ETH community has been fighting against since day one.

&#x200B;

There is a major issue on the network right now. The amount of hashrate going to ETH is dropping. So much so that it lower than 51% of its all time high. This means that there is potentially enough hashrate out there to attack the network. It is an edge case, but stranger things have happened in the crypto world. With the lowered price of ETH, there is also lower profitability. When Constantinople hits, it will magnify this issue because profitability will be cut by 1/3. Unless the price goes up, there is a real risk of enough GPUs leaving the network that ASICs will be the only thing left.

&#x200B;

PoS isn't coming to mainnet for years. It is just taking an extra ordinate amount of time to complete because it is extremely complicated and nobody wants to risk the billions of $'s of value on the network today. PoW isn't going away for years after that as they will both run in parallel. PoS is not going to magically fix everything over night, so it isn't really even part of the discussion at this point.  


Holders of coin should really be voting to protect their investment, not influence the vote because they feel the vote itself is invalid. ProgPoW, is the best hope at doing that right now. Assuming it passes all the technical analysis. Remember that unless someone spends another year coming up with something else, there isn't much else out there to solve the issue. Not to be dire, because we probably have 6-12 months, but time is running out and that can't be ignored. It would be irresponsible to not try to do something.

From my understanding, most token contracts are just a record of what addresses have how many tokens, and that value is defined as a variable in the contract. I think what they did is added an extra multiplier as a variable and the final product from how many tokens you have and/or total supply and the multiplier is what you are able to transact with. i.e. if the multiplier was 1 when you first created and distributed your token, and you increase it to 1.5, every wallet would have 1.5 times as many tokens in their wallets. You would do the same to deflate the value - decrease the multiplier. You could control that multiplier via a price feed of your token from other exchanges so that you wouldnt need to change it manually.

3536,"The easiest one is the current fact that if a contract is selfdestructed the address will never have code again. I can create a ""ERC20 burn address"" where you can send your tokens to ""burn"" them. However, I actually created them with CREATE2 which means that I can create a new contract at this address with different code - e.g. code which transfers all the tokens in the contract to my address!!

Heads up - more detailed explanation ahead.

I want to stress that creating a contract with different code is expensive. CREATE2 allows you to create a contract at an address which is /not/ dependent on the nonce of the contract as is with CREATE. In CREATE every time you construct a new contract the nonce of the contract which creates a new one is updated. Since the deployed address is hashed it is hence not possible in the future to deploy at the same address using CREATE. However, with CREATE2, this is possible. The hashing of CREATE2 takes 4 items:

0xff (a constant, reason for this is to prevent collissions between CREATE / CREATE2 contracts which would overrule ""you cannot redeploy a contract at the address which was created by CREATE) 
address(this) (the contract which is invokes this operation)
seed (this is provided by the user)
keccak256(init_code) (the hash of the code to be deployed)

From this we can see that if you deploy a CREATE2 contract with the same `init_code` and the same `seed` at the same address we get the same output of the hash (because the input is the same!). But this might look confusing - how can you actually deploy an address with different code at the same address if you have to be sure that the `init_code` is the same?

Don't forget that we can also alter storage here! What if you deploy a contract which, for example, stores the current time (now) in the storage AT the constructor? Then if we redeploy the contract we suddenly have a different initial value at this storage slot! And to deploy actual different runtime bytecode we have to know how code is actually deposited at an address. If you CALL to a contract you can read the return value. In CREATE, the ""return value"" of this CALL-like operation is deposited at this address. But since ""return value"" is read from memory this means that we can alter the memory and then return that instead! A simple example to actually deploy different runtime bytecode (which is expensive) is to store the `bytes public runtimeBytecode` at a different contract. Then in the constructor of the CREATE2 contract we call into this contract to retrieve `runtimeBytecode` and actually put this on the returnvalue of the CREATE2 call which means different code is deposited!

However, you can check the runtime bytecode from other contracts via (currently) `extcodecopy` (which copies specific runtime code (or all) from the target contract) or `extcodehash` (which returns the hash of the runtime bytecode). It is obvious that via `extcodehash` we can always verify that runtime bytecode is correct. However, there is no way to verify that nothing fancy happened in the constructor code. Another good example of an attack is a multisig wallet which gets deployed. We can check the runtime bytecode and see that this is indeed a normal multisigwallet. However, in the constructor we can do a fancy trick where we change the owners of the multisigwallet - e.g. where we first had 3 owners and 2 confirmations we now have only one owner! There is hence no way to check this externally.

The contract which I deployed on mainnet prevents to redeploy any contract. If you try it, then the transaction will revert and any deployed code in that transaction will hence be deleted. Hence selfdestructed contracts deployed via this contract *should* forever be selfdestructed.",19-02-15-01-24,8,147,j-brouwer,aqk9k7
3537,"I've been pretty neutral on this topic, but at this point don't see the pros out-weighting the cons.

It's inevitable that someone is going to deploy some popular DApp or DEX,  then suddenly update the contract one day to steal everyone's coins.

Surely end users can't be expected to all read solidity code before they interact with a DApp.

The media response will be simple ""Any CREATE2 contract can be changed at any time to steal your money! ETH isn't secure!""

The investor/dev response will then sell their software by saying ""We DONT use CREATE2!  So our contract is safe!""

Which begs the question to why this should be deployed in the first place.  It's silly.

I don't think you can slice storage quite that finely. Pretty sure you need the contract's entire state, or at least a significant chunk of it. As far as sharding, it's broken because it forces everyone to sync with the shard that contains this contract. It's already a broken pattern, because you'll likely have fragmentation around these ""certification"" registries, which leads to coordination problems.

Yes you can. A full node can provide the merkle proof of a single storage slot to a light client trivially. If a light client had to fetch a contract's entire state every time it requested a slot, erc20 tokens alone would require fetching 10s of thousands of storage slots.

> As far as sharding, it's broken because it forces everyone to sync with the shard that contains this contract.

So have this contract deployed on each shard for contracts deployed on that shard. Also, again, this contract in OP isn't even required. Just check the contract source like you should even with `create`.

> This is trivial to do with create.

but... the internet is ran entirely via consortiums. VISA/Mastercard are consortiums. SWIFT is a consortium... 

your example is a contrived example of a 51% attack being instigated by regulated actors... its far more likely to watch a 51% attack happen on a public chain than it is on a permissioned chain ran by a large consortium, especially now that 51% attack botnets can be rented for cheap. 

One roadblock to your example is that evidence of that event would be available to auditors, and all actors on a permissioned chain will be regulated actors so they'll expose themselves to liability if they aim to tamper with the chain. 

Second roadblock is that by virtue of being permissioned, anyone in a position to execute said tampering would have already been pre-vetted by the consortium, making them being a ""bad actor"" less likely to begin with.

3676,"Ahh, so many platforms.  Copying [my comments from the Medium post](https://medium.com/@jeff_97559/i-wish-you-would-have-written-this-article-differently-jason-6561d0e5b43e) here:

I wish you would have written this article differently, Jason. First, people should have a much better idea of the specific *way* that the init code has to work for this to happen. The whole point of CREATE2 is that the contract can be authenticated against the address, which requires *looking at the init code*. In other words, the init code is the real source code the address is committed to. If anything it is *easier* for websites, users, etc. to verify an init code against a CREATE2 address than it is to verify source code against deployed bytecode under CREATE, for exactly the same reason as the issue you point out here: possible indeterminacy in init code.

It’s not just you, but I am very concerned with this larger trend of thinking that low level technical specifications are always the best way to address security issues. To me the answer to this (and several  related problems) is much simpler: users/websites/etc. need to be verifying *init* code, not just bytecode. I also really wish you would have included the note that virtually all L2 solutions using CREATE2 will in fact be doing just this. When we look at the overall scenarios CREATE2 enables, such as offline multisig, etc. we in fact find that verification of init code in a non-state-dependent way is critical to *all of them* already. So given that the whole point of this EIP is to allow init codes to be verified noninteractively, I actually see CREATE2 as a substantial **improvement** in code accountability, not a threat to it. No matter how you design CREATE2 you will have to teach users and developers that init code is part of source code *anyways*.  Seems to me a very good argument for using the same way of tackling  “wild magic” contracts from a security perspective. Indeterminacy in init code needs to be viewed the same way as indeterminacy in normal code, via DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE. And if you think that indeterminacy is important to have readers know, assert an invariant about it or something.",19-02-14-07-43,17,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg

\- For state-inaccessible contexts (like hardware wallets), auditing CREATE'd contracts is already incredibly difficult, so there is no meaningful loss in safety there

\- Once you know what to look for, auditing CREATE2 contracts is straightforward, even from state-inaccessible contexts, so that's a big step up in security for hardware wallets, etc

\- For state-accessible contexts, (say, running your own node), auditing CREATE'd contracts is currently somewhat straightforward, but gets more difficult after CREATE2 is released (roughly as difficult as state-inaccessible auditing).

I worry that the tooling and community education moves slowly enough that someone might get taken advantage of in the meantime. I agree that the post was written in a state-accessible perspective, and left out the benefits to the state-inaccessible contexts.

Does anyone involved interact with anyone not part of their filter bubble? There's so many steps and layers to get people to trust installing metamask or mycrypto. Changes like this seem designed to kill the dapp ecosystem, likely under the excuse the dapp ecosystem is so small it's an acceptable tradeoff...

You don't seem to understand the issue here. Essentially we must void the use of ""selfdestruct"" in any contract (via any mechanism) OR commit to verifying byte-code every time we call a contract at an address, in real time. 

Furthermore, in the time between when we verified the code and when our transaction is executed, the code can change. 

You are making light of an exceptional burden of proof here.

3683,"Mostly, yes.  Sorry I missed this; like I said, too many platforms going on.  After further examination I would also add that there are plenty of ways to audit even CREATE'd contracts in state-accessible contexts post-CREATE2.  You can statically check if contracts contain a selfdestruct or a DELEGATECALL/CALLCODE (the latter should probably mean a warning in general as it presents the same attack surface).  And even if it does all you need is one ancestor without a selfdestruct (including via DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE) to be fully assured, and most contracts do not have a self-destruct (all of which is statically checkable). Alternatively a single create2 ancestor with a verified-deterministic init code is also sufficient, or creation directly from an EOA (as most contracts are). Lots of websites, tools etc. can check this in state-accessible contexts. This isn't going to be some kind of apocalypse of bugs.  This is a really niche issue.

I didn't say it explicitly earlier, but I am strongly opposed to removing CREATE2 from Constantinople. It's definitely a design goal of lower level changes to help reduce the risk of people getting taken advantage of, but crippling a whole architecture over something that can be solved at a higher level is very wrong.  Ethereum is still very clearly in open beta. I can trivially write weird contracts that will break if *anything* in the network changes.  If an empirical estimate actually showed significant levels of contracts vulnerable to this it would be one thing.  But there's no such thing as an architecture that prevents user confusion.  Every single breaking change is an opportunity for assumptions to be wrong.  But unless that raises the risk significantly above the background rate the increased *benefits* of CREATE2 for verification are much stronger than the risks in my opinion.  I'd also be very curious to hear how you would solve the CREATE under CREATE2 issue without seriously bloating the trie.  Because if there isn't a good solution anyways (and CREATE actually makes this issue quite thorny with its stupid statefulness assumptions) then delaying the introduction is pointless.  The sooner people can switch away from CREATE2 the less risk users will be exposed to.  As it is I have definitely seen attacks in the wild that rely on the non-determinism of CREATE, so I wouldn't say at all that holding off on CREATE2 is risk free for users either.",19-02-14-07-43,4,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg
3684,"I'm not expecting normal users to understand this.  I assume people talking about whether this is worth pulling from Constantinople are devs deep in this, and that even most devs don't need to worry about this *at all*.  For context almost none of this will come up at all in a normal dev pipeline, where people aren't writing weird custom init code themselves.  You have to be really deep for this to affect you, and even then the risk is very similar to any contract having DELEGATECALL in it, which is very common today.  The only impact on end users is how certain ""contract verification"" tools will work under the hood. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect someone writing a contract verification tool to be aware of these edge cases.  There are actually already several similar edge cases around how factories work with CREATE, for example, that such tools need to handle today.

And the Parity thing just has no legs at all.  For context I have been a vocal opponent of any Parity restoration scheme ever since it happened, and I really shouldn't even need to say that because it would take so many steps to connect this topic to that. But for those who care, although I haven't examined the specific Parity wallet init chain I am highly doubtful that any combination of these changes would allow a redeployment of the Parity wallet to the same address.  All these new schemes create new addresses, all locked to specific init codes. They don't let you change old contracts unless there was some weird DELEGATECALL backdoor in an earlier contract which you can still repoint to new redeploying functionality,PLUS having all intermediate children being selfdestructible so you can remove them before redeploying them.  I'll happily go on record estimating that I don't presently think even the weird future 2.0 stuff combined with this would allow the re-initialization of the Parity contract at the same address. Specifically I highly doubt that the parent contract which initially deployed the Parity contract is itself destructible, or that any sequence of destructible parents leads to something with a re-keyable DELEGATECALL just sitting in it.  That would be an incredibly unusual design pattern.",19-02-14-07-43,6,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg
3685,"This is the whole problem with CREATE.  CREATE2, and realizing that init code is part of what you have to verify, is the solution to this problem. You can mutate unconfirmed CREATE today, and HW wallets or cold wallets or devices too small to verify the chain are all up a creek without a paddle already.  I don't *like* the problems with CREATE, which is why I want to *fix* them. Propose a better approach here and I'll be happy to hear it.  Having CREATE not even *allow* committing to contract contents was a design error, and it needs fixing.",19-02-14-07-43,0,13,technocrypto,aqb8yg
3686,">After further examination I would also add that there are plenty of ways to audit...

Yup, I believe all of these are covered in the original post. The biggest problem is when people don't even know that re-deploying is a possibility. That's why most of the post is written to help people learn what new things can happen and how to watch out for them. (The article would have been pointless if everyone was already educated about the possibilities)

>Ethereum is still very clearly in open beta.

I agree that beta is the best way to think of Ethereum mainnet as a developer, but that's not a widespread opinion. At this point there is responsibility to keep it reasonably safe given how many assets are already stored on it.

>curious to hear how you would solve the CREATE under CREATE2 issue without seriously bloating the trie

>I wouldn't say at all that holding off on CREATE2 is risk free for users either.

It's *certainly* not risk free, for even more reasons:

* Any change with only a couple weeks left means limited time for client testing, because we need to regenerate the tests, implement it in all the clients, and test the clients against each other.
* It's a very tight time window to coordinate a testnet release.
* It's hard to get everyone to update to a new client in a short time window.",19-02-14-07-43,1,289,carver,aqb8yg

Not true.  Create, with self-destruct is what it is after you have audited it *ONCE*.  As long as you call the same contract at the same address, you are *guaranteed* that it will have the behavior you audited, or throw if it selfdestructed.

Create2, with self-destruct (and other ways of achieving same), is whatever anyone wants it to be, and must therefore be tested *EVERY TIME YOU INTEND TO USE IT*

The problem is not with create2, or with selfdestruct (etc.), it is with the combinatorial complexity that they introduce.

Please explain to me how any design at all both allows new contract designs but prevents an unsophisticated user from misunderstanding what source code does.  The solution in my view is that the regular users shouldn't have to read the source code, which you get with a lot of work by very technical people on the back end so that users can just use the features up front without trying to become an advanced security analyst, and the UI faithfully representing the net effect of all that work in easily understandable terms.

Come on, this is a solved problem in upgradeable distributed systems design. You require that upgradeable routines (contracts in this case) are called with a version parameter passed by the user, and which matches the version in execution.  That way there is an interlock where the caller explicitly has to agree to invoke the upgraded function in order to be served the upgraded functionality.    

You can, if you want, create an ""any version"" parameter (e.g. version 0 = all versions) that can be passed for full forwards-compatibility, but this requires *TRUST*.

You have to choose whether you are developing a system in which there is trust - in which case unconstrained upgrades are easy and seamless - or lack of trust - in which case upgrades need to be explicit and agreed.   

But you can't say you are developing a platform that does not require trust, and then embed capabilities that assume trust.  That's just a haven for exploits.

DPoS: there is some 10-30 master validators that act as the miners for the whole system. So it's just not decentralized. A cartel forms immediately, and votes to replace key validators are usually rigged or non-existent.

PoS: real decentralized version where anyone can stake and participate. It's much more difficult because trust is no longer in the equation. You have to balance attack vs defense, which has been a big research subject. Eth has iterated over like 5 PoS concepts that didn't work for one reason or another

Novacoin extended the codebase and I think Blackcoin was the first pure PoS blockchain going live (happy to be corrected on this one). Many many shitcoins have since then been forked off blackcoin or novacoin and make use of these PoS systems.

However, all of them are theoretically vulnerable to long range attacks (their coinage system can be gamed) and the infamous nothing at stake problem (no slashing conditions exist). Afaik they all avoid these attack vectors by adding checkpoints in their client software, which however results in a centralization issue since the dev is responsible to declare one chain to be the right one.

The dfifferences to the approach implemented in ethereum are mainly that the system in ethereum PoS allows to perform decentralized checkpointing (also referred to as *finality*) and that it penalizes bad behavior, thereby solving the nothing-at-stake problem.

Delegated Proof of Stake reaches consensus through voting and reaching quorum. If you are not online or informed to vote, you can delegate your vote to someone else to vote for you. EOS, Lisk, Ark, and Nano use this. In Nano’s case, representitives only have very limited power to vote on double-spent, and receive no monetary incentives (just like Bitcoin nodes). Therefore it doesn’t have the cartel problems that other DPoS coins have. You can see that DPoS is not inherently centralized. It depends on the cryptoeconomic design.

Dash uses masternodes and miners. There are no votes involved in the consensus process from non-masternode participants and therefore is not DPoS. Neo uses federated BFT. Correct me if I’m wrong, I think Stellar also uses some version of BFT. Again, no votes from regular users involved.

the public DFinity sale was done at an effective pro rata share of tokens (and keeps 25% of all DFNs), and the vc sale they did at a higher valuation of DFNs so the public probably own more tokens than the vc's, so far at least.

as for the question of which is more advanced, DFinity started out originally as a fork of Ethereum as its base layer, and then spent a few years upgrading it to be more powerful and higher performant, so it seems likely that at the moment DFinity eventually ships, it will be an upgrade over ethereum as it stands today.   Hopefully Ethereum will catch up and surpass with Serenity, though that isnt certain how long it'll take.

Like some others (Ameen) i too am worried over the 3 year guidance we've been given for Serenity to be usable in the same way that Ethereum is today (phase 2, 2021!).   I think there will be competitive blockchains coming out all the time that will be superior to Ethereum, and we can only hang on so long before the call of mainstream adoption requires us to consider other chains to get the capabilities and performance that we need for our applications.

3837,"You can delegate in Tezos, but the validator set is much larger than the delegated proof of stake consensus mechanisms you’re thinking about. EOS is limited to 21 block producers, baking in Tezos is limited only by the necessity to own 1 roll (currently 10,000 Tez). There’s already a vote being debated on whether to reduce the minimum roll size from 10,000 to 8,000 Tezos per roll. And, it should come down over time. 

Currently I believe that the network can support a theoretical 80,000 individual solo bakers (1 roll per baker). 

Tez also does not have a capped token supply as each block rewards 16 XTZ and 2 Tez per Endorser. If bakers or delegator choose to sell their rewards, these coins will enter the hands of new owners whom can solo-bake / validate once they get enough for a roll. 

So really, it’s not exactly correct to call Tezos DPOS the same way you would EOS, Cardano, Cosmos, etcetera.

Plasma group has a beta release public testnet version in two to three months. It doesn't have a mechanism like a watcher which OMG is working towards. But it supports atomic swaps which are needed to build a DEX.

Why is it that OMG is taking so much time for a public testnet?

Check out @kelvinfichter’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1091761057142517760?s=09

It’s not production quality yet, but we wanted to give people the tools to start playing with it. That way we can already have people using it once it moves into production. There’s a lot of open work for people to help out on and more issues will pop up in the next few days :-)

So, the recent testnet release by Plasma group is not a production version. 

Likewise the LeapDAO testnet release is also an early release and not a production release.

It is just that OmiseGO kept early releases internal and is choosing to do a production version for the external testnet release. This surely has it's advantages. In this context it would help to again read OmiseGO's reply given below

We extend our congratulations to the LeapDAO team, who were incubated by our partner Status, for bringing a public testnet online. This isn’t a race; everyone who is working on plasma brings something different to the table and everyone takes a different approach. LeapDAO chose to deploy a public testnet at a relatively early phase of development; OmiseGO have thus far chosen to keep our OMG testnet internal in order to publicly deploy something more polished and stable. We have also been running our release candidates against Rinkeby since December. The means of deploying the testnet are available in the form of the child chain server and watcher, which anyone can deploy - and which we have deployed in multiple iterations, but we have so far not opened those iterations to the public. We won’t argue that either approach is correct or incorrect; just different.

As for whether LeapDAO has appropriated the work of the OmiseGO team in some way, here’s how we understand it: although LeapDAO started from the MoreVP design proposed by Kelvin Fichter and Ben Jones with help from a motley crew of Ethereum community members, they did not fork OmiseGO’s code.

There have already been some good analyses of the differences between LeapDAO’s plasma and OMG plasma in this sub. We’re going to refrain from commenting in further technical detail until we have a better understanding of LeapDAO’s work thus far; we look forward to seeing more thorough documentation as it becomes available.

Nvidia does well in ProgPoW so we should be careful about Ohgodagirl and IfdefElse ""back-door deals""

That's a totally a Ad Hominem Fallacy. So can we get the same thing for X16R? Zhash? GRIN? Their teams have back-door deals with massive nvidia mining farms? Nvidia dominates many algorithms already because of there much more efficient architecture and CUDA implementation in low-level software rather than using OPENCL.

&#x200B;

There's thousands of AMD farms, far more than Nvidia's. Going off ETHOS own page RX470's are top cards used, then RX480s, and lower on the rung is the P106/104/P102 cards.  I would say AMD OEMs were giving the special treatment to many larger farms rather than individual miners during the low-stock period. Nvidia was extremely late to that game and barely reaped any rewards. Changing the algorithm to ProgPoW isn't magically going to make Nvidia billions of dollars because of sales of GPUs. All it's going to do right now is make GPU-mining for Ethereum viable for another year or two... at best.

IMHO GRIN would be a better focus for your attention to create and ASIC for. GRIN is stated to become an ASIC-Algorithm and throwing off GPU miners. It's ironically an Nvidia dominated Algorithm right now btw.

I do have an honest question.

Theoretically, because Ethereum is built in an Difficulty bomb/iceage and say we don't move to ProgPoW. what then? How are ASIC farms going to stay profitable in that time-period? When the difficulty ticks slowly upwards. How could you sell ASICs then? Who would buy? There's no chances of quick ROIs on Ethereum. It's not built like other cryptos.

ASICs then would flood other Eth-hash networks until the profitability of them is barely anything. Most would be sold for nil or dumped in land-fills because they are not useful for anything else. The idea that you're going to walk graciously away is stupid. You're investing millions into manufacture and engineering these ASICs. You can recoup maybe your initial investment selling/selfish mining, but in one or two years its going to be basically be nothing.  ASICs aren't a sustainable model for Ethereum and Eth-hash.

So far, there are no facts that ""asics are bad' as an a-priori statement.  Just bad if they represent a centralizing function... but if that's bad, then PoS sucks... so... not bad, a-priori.   There are also no facts that suggest ASICs are prevalent.  In fact, everything triangulates to the fact that they are an irrelevant contributor to current hashpower, and subject to being overtaken by tweaking of commodity GPUs (which are also ASICs).  Finally, the stated intention of Ethereum is to move to PoS, in which all mining is irrelevant, and nobody's having the discussion to ditch PoS. 

Thus, all this fuss about an ASIC resistant algorithm is about something that nobody can prove is bad, against something nobody can prove exists, for a purpose everyone agrees is ultimately irrelevant.

Your argument is not standing on firm principles here, because you are being selective in your position. 

Special purpose technology is often beneficial, although it almost always hurts the incumbent ecosystem.    Automobiles are very custom engines, with the sole purpose of taking people from point A to point B.  Back in the days of horses, we also had engines, and we also had the entire carriage industry up in arms against these horseless carriages, because their investment in horses and barns was about to be made obsolete.  The result of active lobbying by horse-cart industry includes laws to have people walk in front of cars. This had the intended consequence of making cars more expensive and less practical, versus the espoused consequence of being safer.  But it's patently ludicrous, in hindsight.

I'm not just picking one example.  Personal computers were attacked by the mainframe industry. ATMs really messed up the lives and occupations of millions of tellers. The Internet destroyed ""long distance minutes"" as a business. There are millions of miles of perfectly good copper wire in the ground to every house in the US... rotting.... because we have wireless phones instead...  

Innovation happens and special purpose devices - whether ASIC or not - intervene and render trillions of dollars of capital obsolete.  GPUs occupy no special pedestal in technical Darwinism, and it is absurd to treat them as some sacrosanct technology.  Regardless of how loud the priests of the GPU tribe are shouting.

>I would like to see other PoW algorithms adopt ProgPoW 

Why?  It's just an algorithm.  How about if they use ETHHash? Personally, I would prefer if ETHHash becomes as prevalent as 802.11, which only occurred when there were chips for that. Why not have chips for ETHHash and drive it into everything?   Why should everything come with a GPU and only a GPU and never evolve past that?  Unless of course one is a member of tribe-GPU, in which case totally understandable. 

I want the same thing.  I am arguing from the basis of history which suggests that the fastest path to ubiquity is to embed functionality in cheap silicon, and not entrench it in expensive $500-a-pop GPUs. 

Proprietary advantage is not how the endgame emerges.   Otherwise, Texas Instruments would own the entire PC market.  And they don't. 

>I care about making the hash as decentralized as it can be or crypto assets have no value to me.

Me too.  But let's take that apart.

First, I detect ZERO evidence that ASICs are a cause of centralization.  In fact, although they are widely assumed to exist, all evidence requires that they are remarkably broadly distributed, and therefore just as benignly centralizing as GPUs.  Mining farms are *far* more of a centralizing force than ""ASICs"", and we don't seem to have anyone railing against these.

Second, ""*making the hash as decentralized as it can be*"" - that doesn't have to be anti-ASIC on an a-priori basis.  Bitcoin seems to be surviving (in fact dominating) and it's algorithm is completely dominated by ASIC.  So you are arguing a non-sequitor in the face of the only evidence that exists. Diverting ETH Devs to implement ProgPOW is taking away resources from usable applications, from PoS, and from all kinds of things.  It's a side-show to the main event.

>surely you understand that the W in Proof of Work is measured by the energy spent on it. 

No, I do not understand this, because it is wrong.  The ""W"" in proof of work is measured in hashes per unit time.   That happens to correlate to the energy spent, but is only 1:1 between devices that have the same energy cost per hashes-per-second.  A device that generates the same number of hashes-per-second at 1/10 the energy generates the same WORK (the W), but 1/10 the energy cost.  It isn't accidental that we don't call it PoE.  

Sorry, but I am not so easily fooled.  

> Each time energy is saved, more devices are added, difficulty goes up and no extra security or energy savings was accomplished.

Again, not true.

Mining is a tournament business:  adding more miners does not increase the number of ETH that are mined, because difficulty algorithm adjusts.  It does change who gets the ETH that is mined.  When we are at equilibrium, and there is a distribution of energy-cost per unit hash-per-second, what it means is that less efficient (and costly) devices become less profitable and drop out, and more energy efficient devices take their place, and the hashpower remains constant, if the devices coming in cost the same as the devices going out.

If there is a cost advantage to the energy efficient devices, and energy is the *only* cost, then yes, the total hashpower would go up by a factor of 10 and then the ETH reward per unit energy would not change.  But since there is a capital cost of hardware that needs to also be considered, and this is non-trivial compared to the energy cost, and needs to be compensated by the ETH that is earned, the net energy cost of the same  amount of hashpower is lower.  

>Before you go on and paint me as Tribe GPU again.  

Apologies.  I wasn't talking about you per-se, but as a voice of the pro-progPOW constituency, which is dominated whether knowingly or unknowningly by the priests of the GPU tribe.  I can't tell whether you are a priest in disguise, or one of the brainwashed flock, or just someone advancing an argument that doesn't rest on the reasons they think it does.  But ""you"" is meant collectively.

ProgPoW is not a complete PoW algorithm, its a design philosophy that can be applied to any memory hard PoW algorithm.  Instead of leaving space for an inefficient arms race, it it forces the hardware to work hard.

One algo for all chains is dangerous for all but the dominant chain.  See every single 51% attack.

A measurement in hashes is meaningless, the energy consumed to solve a hash is what matters.  Go back to the principles behind Proof of Work, even before Blockchain.  Work comes at a cost, that is why we value it.  If few parties can hash the same while expending less energy their signals (hashes) are not as trustworthy because they are not expending as much energy to perform the work as the rest of the network.  If all of the network can hash more for less energy, they will keep buying devices.   Hardware is an asset, energy spent is a liability.  Hardware costs are recouped in a relatively short period of time.  See https://medium.com/@OhGodAGirl/the-problem-with-proof-of-work-da9f0512dad9

With regards to the short period of PoW left on ethereum, I am anti-asic and maybe this is where I look and sound like a duck.  The change from PoW to PoS is my reason for this.  New eth asic's are coming, it is in the interest of the companies making those asics and the purchases of them to make a fork to PoS a contentious one, whether or not they are successful will not matter for all the bad press it will cause further sullying the name of crypto.

3992,"> The only argument to say that ProgPoW is anti-asic is that in order for an asic to be financially viable it must be able to monopolize the network hash.

Wrong. In order for an ASIC to be viable it has to give miners a marginally better return on investment than mining with a GPU.  Period.  The same can be said about the next generation of GPU.  If either ultimately displace less capital-efficient mining rigs, previous generations of GPUs, whatever, that's a consequence of economic Darwninism, not an a-priori requirement for an ""ASIC"", or a ""GPU"".  

Also, ProgPOW is ""anti ASIC"" merely and precisely because it is pro ""only GPU"".  This is by design and no amount of fancy language footwork changes this fact.   If you are a member of the ""Only GPU"" tribe, then you clearly not a member of the ""something-that-isn't-a-GPU"" tribe.  Whether you admit it or not.

>Instead of leaving space for an inefficient arms race, it it forces the hardware to work hard. 

Come on, now you are just coloring inside the lines.  ProgPOW forces **GPU** hardware to work hard, and it forces anything that isn't a GPU to be exactly like a GPU if it wants to work at all.    Which is to say, it forces only GPUs.   

>The change from PoW to PoS is my reason for this. New eth asic's are coming, it is in the interest of the companies making those asics and the purchases of them to make a fork to PoS a contentious one, whether or not they are successful will not matter for all the bad press it will cause further sullying the name of crypto. 

Oh dear, it appears you haven't been paying attention.  

First, a ""fork"" to PoS isn't happening.   There is no fork, which is the elegant finesse of Shasper.   Once Constantinople goes through, everything necessary to shift to PoS can happen *WITH NO FORK*.  this is why it was so important to delay Constantinople until the miners are up against a wall.  

Second, even without ProgPOW, when ETH shifts to PoS, what precisely do you think 150 Terahash worth of GPUs are going to do?  Roll over and play dead?   We saw what 10 TH of GPUs heading over to ETH Classic did.  There already isn't enough alt-coin hashing to absorb all the GPUs on Ethereum, let alone ASICs.  That problem is already yours to navigate.  Multiplying the participants by two isn't going to make it twice as bad.  Ultimately, you are suggesting to defend against the oncoming tsunami by building a sandcastle.  Not very wise.  ",19-02-13-22-50,1,299,jps_,aq5s8v

How much lower BETH can get than ETH is not determinable at this point. But it could be much lower at times. This is almost guaranteed to be a source of FUD and potentially a drag on the price of ETH as well as a strong discouragement from investors increasing the amount of staked funds over time.

The ability to release ETH sent to the staking contract on ETH 1.0 after burning those funds on the 2.0 chain would alleviate these issues, and eliminate the price variance (and hence exchanges wouldn't bother to launch a BETH ticker).

Perhaps the price of BETH will remain very close to that of ETH (we would expect that if there is an increasing demand to stake over time, as stakers would simply buy up discounted BETH and stake with that). That would be the best scenario possible for the ecosystem, but there is no guarantee it will happen.

It's almost always better to allow the free flow of funds in an economic system to prevent these kinds of imbalances. A one-way flow to the beacon chain is very close to being equivalent to perfect capital controls in a nation-state.

The whole point of a tradable pair is that the prices are different. No one will bother making a BETH ticker if BETH can be converted back to ETH (2-way flow).

Sort of yes, and sort of no.

It is an exponential.  The effect increase by a factor of two every 100,000 blocks.  When the effect is small, say, 1/1000'th of a tick, nobody cares when it doubles to 1/500'th of a tick.   But when it gets big, from 1/4 of a tick to 1/2 of a tick, it becomes noticeable.

Quite clearly you didn't notice that they had gone up from about 15.5 seconds to 17 seconds.  Just like you hadn't noticed them go from 14 seconds to 15.5 seconds.  But yesterday, when they jumped twice as much from 17 seconds to 20 seconds... you finally noticed.

Because it is.  What other factor increases difficulty (hint: more total hashpower.  Double-hint: [hashpower has been decreasing since August last year](https://etherscan.io/chart/hashrate)).  

> The difficulty bomb is a check put into the code like an alarm clock for ethereum developers to switch over to proof of stake mining instead of proof of work.

It's to force hard-fork upgrades, not just to PoS.

> it will make mining a block more and more difficult even without more miners joining the network to equilizate the time it takes to find a block which is supposed to be around 12 seconds.

It increases the difficulty regardless of how many miners are joining/leaving.  The point is to increase block times to infinity, making the blockchain unusable without forking it.

> The proof of stake stage is titled ""casper"" or also some people have tagged it Ethereum 2.0 and will mean at least in part, mining will take place in wallets holding over 30 or so ethereum instead of gpu and asic mining specific hardware.

""Casper"" is a protocol, or classification of protocols, not the development stage in which Ethereum implements PoS.  ETH 2.0 involves sharding, not just PoS.  Mining doesn't take place in wallets..  Wallets don't even exist to the blockchain at all.  The 30+ number is a placeholder, it may or may not be what the minimum stake is.

Most times user interfaces will autofill the data encoding, so you don't have to worry about it.

When you store ASCII text then we can look at this table http://www.asciitable.com and see that per the ASCII specification, an uppercase K is stored by the byte 01001011. In hex this byte value is 4B. So if you store the hex value 4B in the data field, then what you actually did is store the byte 01001011. And if you tell people that the data in there should be interpreted as ASCII then people will know that it is the letter K.

So yes you can very easily store ASCII there. You just have to tell people that it is supposed to be ASCII. You can store *anything* there, you just have to tell people how to decode it.

You're not paying for access, you're paying for ownership. The fact that paying for access is the de facto source of revenue is the root problem that World's Fair is attempting to address. It's hard to wrap your mind around because [the attention economy has been around for a very long time](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/whitepaper#application-bypassing-attention-economy)",19-02-11-14-17,1,695,lovvtide,apbx7x

4512,"Yes, that's the trouble isn't it? During development I was surprised there there didn't seem to be a good source of data for vetted beneficiaries, so I started creating one. It's not just for World's Fair—any app can use this list. We're trying to be as transparent as possible so it can serve as a resource for the community and other developers. So far there's 13 beneficiaries, and is available [from the API](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/docs#web-beneficiary-list), as well as [on Github](https://github.com/lovvtide/worldsfair/blob/master/BENEFICIARIES.json).

World's Fair contract allows assets to name any address they want as beneficiary, or even to not name a beneficiary at all. Having a fake/scammy beneficiary address is a bad look for an asset, and so there does exist some incentive on the author's part to pick a legitimate one, if only to avoid dissuading investment (the same goes for supporters who are hoping to resell their shares at some point).

Since there's no practical way to enforce a whitelist at the contract level, for the time being we're taking this centralized approach of curating the whitelist. [From the whitepaper](https://rinkeby.worldsfair.io/whitepaper#implementation-beneficiary-whitelist):

> Admittedly, this is a centralized solution—although it's not as bad as it seems. Each entry on the whitelist includes the name of the charitable organization, their main website, and the url of the specific page where the donation address is listed. Even so, World's Fair allows authors to name other addresses too, which, if not included in the whitelist, show up as ""Unknown Beneficiary"" on the official front end. Users are free to search that address for themselves to decide if it's legitimate. Only in cases where a beneficiary is clearly not a real charity will we take the step of blacklisting that address. In time, we'd like to move towards a more decentralized solution by involving the community in the effort to compile and curate a large crowd-sourced list of known charities that are capable of accepting Ethereum donations. Finally, you don't have to trust the World's Fair admins: this is a completely open source project, so anyone could in principle create their own frontend and their own beneficiary whitelist/blacklist if they were unsatisfied with the editorial policy.

By the way, if someone wants to make a crypto version of Charity Navigator, that'd be awesome! It could be like a non-profit org that helps onboard established charities by getting them set up with an Ethereum address. Or something like that.

As far as a long term, scalable, and fully decentralized solution, here's what I'm thinking: You could create ""multi-beneficiary"" contracts that would act as an intermediary to receive donations and then subsequently disburse the funds to multiple donation addresses under some form of democratic governance. I don't know exactly how that would work, it could be as simple as a contract where a majority vote from existing addresses in the beneficiary contract can remove other members. Having a way for bad actors (or even just addresses with lost/compromised keys) to be ""voted off the island"" would be very useful.

This is probably the #1 thing idea I'm excited about and hoping to get the community's help with during the testnet phase of World's Fair, because it's a *real problem*. If decentralized/democratic solution could be successfully implemented, it would be an incredible demonstration of Ethereum's capabilities.

4513,"When you create an asset, it's defined on the blockchain (the IPFS hash is stored, along with other data). World's Fair then periodically reads that data off the blockchain and indexes it in a database.

To answer your question, if you store an IPFS hash on the blockchain that points to illegal/copyrighted content, it *will* be removed by a human moderator from the World's Fair's database.

My idea is that open source developers, regardless of whether they are building extensions/integrations to World's Fair or otherwise, can just create an asset for their repo and focus on coding.

Actually a ""replacement for Patreon"" is *exactly* what I had in mind when developing World's Fair! It's pretty crazy how ""a website whose business model is people giving away money to strangers"" is so successful, even to the point that it's starting to subsidize the business model of certain for-profit platforms. I see that as strong evidence that the generosity of human beings is underrated. World's Fair doesn't have to be used for just speculation. Buying shares of art/ideas/tech that you support, and owning those shares on the blockchain could also be viewed as just giving away money, but from a high level, it's starting to look like some kind of collective ownership is a great way to fund intellectual works.

4600,"Garoththorp, ERC-1155 fixes the rigid limitations of both token standards.

ERC-20 and ERC-721 are limited to describing a single token type that's either fungible or non-fungible, and strictly one type per contract. ERC-1155 shifts the token type from being the contract address to the token\_id.

I'm sure you can summon some imagination to realize that multiple token types managed by a single smart contract with common rules and permissions are vastly more flexible than the existing alternatives (Cloning the same program out endlessly, and siloing each individual token type in separate smart contracts)

* Simple and flexible atomic trades between different token types on-chain and off-chain.
* Batch transfers require one transaction instead of 1+(n token approvals)
* ""Programmable Money"" is a lot more powerful if the ""program"" can access multiple token types natively.
* Defining and minting new token types is more logical in ERC-1155, only storing the minimal difference between each unique token.
* No need to do cross-contract calls for basic functionality.

Secondly, you bring out a red herring argument that 20/721 standards are already being used in the ecosystem. Should the existence of some software ever stop the need for improvement? The old two standards are locked and not receiving further updates. ERC-1155 provides useful new functionality and there's no reason it won't be adopted by people who see its advantages for their use case.

Ethereum, from the start, has chosen decentralization and security. Its plan has been to backpedal to be scalable from the start.

EOS hasn't done the whole decentralization nor security things well, but has achieved better scalability. Popular opinion is that EOS and Tron are more synonymous with Cloud Computing platforms than actual blockchains for now. 

It's egregiously unfair to compare Ethereum's scalability to something like EOS for now. To put it simply, if I were in the Holocaust, I would never dare touch EOS or Tron for being the mechanisms for storing my data. It would have to be Ethereum, because it's too difficult to shut down (too decentralized, which is good).

4680,">mining block reward is going to be reduced which creates less supply and may increase the demand which ultimately effects the price of ETH in a positive way but that just my theory!

This is conventional wisdom, but it doesn't rest on much.

It assumes too many things to be useful in any reasonable timeframe.  

First, the total ""supply""/""demand"" of ETH that trades in a day is about 100x the amount mined in a day, so the maximum factor by which the ~~ice age~~ issuance reduction can possibly impact a supply/demand equation is about 1/3 of 1%.  ETH is not sufficiently elastic that this represents a significant price-shifting influence.

Second, boats float upon the tide, and the biggest determinant in the price of ETH is the price of BTC, which is entirely decoupled from how many ETH are mined on a daily basis. 

Third, the ETH that circulates is a very small fraction of the ETH that exists.  A huge chunk of ETH hasn't really moved since the original distribution.   These illiquid reservoirs represent several years of 100% of the current mining rewards.

Finally, the utility of ETH is for paying ""gas"".  Since an entire block's worth of transaction uses about 0.03 ETH in gas, the current supply of ETH (about 100M) represents about 3 billion blocks worth of transactions - or enough to power ETH for more than the next ~~century~~ millennium, and that's if all gas is only used once.  Which it isn't.  In other words, there is so much supply of gas that it cannot possibly be consumed by demand in the lifetime of ETH.  If you believe in the law of supply and demand, then it is difficult not to believe in the price of gas going ultimately to zero, and taking the price of ETH with it.  The only saving grace is speculation, which as you can plainly see from the price of ETh, completely dominates the price of ETH.

Speculation has nothing to do with how many ETH are mined in a day, as anyone can plainly see.

4710,"UPD:

Based on the comments received let me bring the discussion one level up and argue that:

\- having escrow as a standard protocol let the parties involved create their own net of escrows, which the parties compile at will.   
Escrow1 - swap the actual values between Alis and Bob as per the conditions they have agreed upon.  
Escrow2, 3.... etc,  - services, which would facilitate the swap all the way through. 

You can rent out your bungalow through Escrow1 and have Escrow2 service in it (e.g. security checks) and Escrow2 (cleaning services). Escrow3 (notary services) ... and all the escrow you compile at will as Lego pieces.  

Even further - having the ability to escrow opens totally new way of thinking. 

For example I could now lock my private keys to the conditions i create myself. Say, you go on vacation and worry about your 24 words being left in your house. No problem, because you can now lock the ability to restore it for... say a month, or lock it to your Digi-ID only by using an escrow of a notary service to prove your identity over a short Skype video call, let's call it ""ID CALL"". The beauty of this is that whoever you call to ID yourself would only perform a function that you have setup.  The ID CALL with a notary person will only ID yourself and, say, a secret phrase that you had specified in the conditions of this particular notary escrow. This way the notary won't even know what this particular ID CALL is tied up to - he or she or they would only perform one simple specific task .... nothing more. 

This will decentralize every step of the whole process (escrow1->escrow2->escrow3->..... etc) without compromising the quality of the whole deal. Each party would simply following their conditions of their escrow only, without even knowing what the whole, the general escrow is all about. 

Same with fiat money (while it's still around). I guess in future the role of banks will be reduced and they will only be happy to be providing such a escrow to, say, confirm that the money actually arrived on you account... but then again - it is you now who would be setting the rules, not them.

Create2 is being introduced so that you can treat a contract as though it exists, fund it with assets, make it responsible for certain tasks, etc. and only deploy the actual contract when you need to settle up.

If a contract is designed such that users know its safe to interact with a non-existant contract, then presumably it could be designed so it's safe to assume the contract could self destruct and be redeployed with the same behavior for when it's needed later.

For example, suppose you had a contract factory that deployed multisig contracts. Three people could determine the future address based on the addresses of the signers, and send tokens to that address. When someone proposes a transaction, it actually deploys the multisig contract. Once all authorizers have approved the transaction and it executes, the contract could self destruct and wait until the next proposed transaction (assuming there aren't any other pending transactions). The contracts could exist only when they're needed, and exist in a sort of off-chain limbo where they can be recreated as needed without taking up space on chain.

Of course, you want to confirm that the contract factory is always going to create it with the same key parameters, but that's a prerequisite for create2's key use cases. ",19-02-10-00-24,3,2774,AusIV,aosaly

Still, for post-C contracts, it would mean you would have to explicitly verify whether CREATE2 was used anywhere in the creation chain when interpreting a contract that contains a self-destruct function. Because if it wasn't used, the aforementioned example with an ERC20's approve function would be safe to call if you agree with the contract's approve function.

4757,"> There's a few factors. With create, the address is a function of the nonce, so if you did things out of order you could end up unable to deploy code to the intended address.

But this is trivially solvable with some simple patterns.  I gave an example of one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aosaly/create2_eip_vulnerability_questions/eg9n3xk/?context=3).  You can solve this with the existing set of opcodes, which makes this an insufficient reason to introduce a new one alone.

> Additionally, with create there's no relationship between code and address.  Two people couldn't really agree to treat an address as though it would have a particular behavior, because any code could end up at that address.

I don't see why this would ever need to be relevant?  With the same pattern outlined above, you *could* have two people agree on how to treat the address, because they've created a contract that can *only* create the agreed upon contract, and they can each derive its address from the address of said generator.

> With create2, the address is independent of nonce, but tied to the code. That means you can ensure the contract will be deployed at a particular address without concern for nonce, and that it will have a particular behavior because the address depends on the code.

But this instead introduces the edge case wherein different code can be deployed at that same address in opaque ways.  `init_code` might be static, but there's nothing stopping it from doing a dynamic lookup for the code.  So not only does this not solve the problem you're putting forth, it actually makes it worse.

So, again, none of the scenarios put forth are either problems that cannot already be solved with the existing code set.  `create2` doesn't provide a solution to a problem that cannot be solved without it--and it also introduces additional edge cases that can lead to bad behavior. I think that amounts to a net loss.

4760,Yeah #4 not an issue. My view is this doesn't warrant a delay. Not many contracts use selfdestruct anyway and I see this change as making it even rarer (as auditing contracts with selfdestruct will be tricky) but this is balanced by the additional functionality provided by CREATE2 (and not delaying the fork again) which IMO are more important.

4762,"As I understand it, the primary goal is to reduce costs for certain types of state channel implementations.

Right now you can use state channels where you deploy a contract, two parties fund it, and each signs a message describing everyone's balance. They can then move assets around within the state channel by having every member of the state channel sign a message describing everyone's updated balances. If everyone agrees to close out the state channel, everyone can sign one last message, submit it to the contract, and everyone gets paid out. If one or more individuals choose not to cooperate with settling the state channel, any individual can submit the last message signed by the whole group, then after a period of time (if nobody produces a more recent message signed by the whole group) the contract will pay everyone according to the last message.

Right now to create a state channel the contract has to actually be deployed. With create2, the members of a state channel could agree to a specific contract, fund the address it will eventually be deployed to, and run the state channel as though the contract exists. If everyone agrees to settle the state channel, you could deploy the contract and in the same transaction settle it, then have the contract selfdestruct. The contract didn't need to exist for a whole transaction, and since the selfdestruct refunded part of the gas for the creation of the contract the overall cost of the state channel was very low. If you have someone refusing to cooperate, any individual could deploy the contract to handle the state channel settlement process, and gas ends up costing what it would have cost if you had deployed the state channel conventionally. 

You can take this a step further with another layer of abstraction. A larger group of people agrees to a state channel factory contract. All participants fund the state channel factory, and sign messages that designate the creation of specific state channels, indicating how each state channel is to be funded by the state channel factory. Then, the participants in an individual state channel can send funds back and forth to each other as though their state channel contract exists, even though the factory that will eventually create their state channel doesn't exist yet (and within a state channel, signatures are only required by the participants of the state channel, not the state channel factory). Periodically, the state channels that will be generated by the state channel factory can be rebalanced, so if two people have stopped transacting with each other frequently and would rather transact with other people who belong to the state channel factory, so long as they can get signatures from all participants in the state channel factory the state channels can be rebalanced *without any transactions on chain*. The contract for the state channel that got closed never gets created on chain, but it could have been if any member of the state channel factory had ceased participating. If everyone in the state channel factory agrees to close their state channels at the same time, they can sign a message to settle and pay out every account their balances without ever actually creating *any* of the the state channel contracts (just the factory contract). But if anyone refuses to cooperate, you can commit the last message everyone signed to create all the individual state channels it described, then the members of each of those state channels can choose to continue transaction on their state channel, or settle the state channels and reclaim their funds.

I think that's where the real power of create2 lies. You can have multiple layers of contracts that would be created if people cease cooperating, but so long as everyone cooperates you can keep a lot of transactions from ever hitting the chain, and a lot of contracts from ever being created.",19-02-10-00-24,2,2774,AusIV,aosaly

Which, by definition, means they're not trustless systems :) You have to trust social consensus.  Given the way the DAO fork played out, it's pretty easy to see how manipulable social consensus actually is.  Every democratic political system provides additional ample evidence of this.

> Even the Bitcoin blockchain turned out not to be immutable.

Except the bitcoin blockchain has always been immutable?  Yeah yeah, you'll move the goalposts and pick some bug as reason it's ""not immutable"", but there's a pretty clear difference between a system bug (i.e. an overflow), and a bug in a contract written atop an otherwise unflawed system, and then rewriting part of that system to correct the bug in the contract.

I linked to a really brief intro the project I wrote up above [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GridPlus/comments/ad5yyz/welcome_to_rgridplus_introduction_overview_links/) but [their main site](https://gridplus.io/) is probably the best jumping off point.

So, why crypto? Most of the reason is what's going on under the hood which consumers don't have to understand or care about - it lets them circumvent expensive legacy payment systems. Short time interval payments via payment channel means the company isn't accruing liabilities for customer debts and chasing bad debt expense which is a costly part of running a traditional utility. The Lattice1 is linked to customers' smart meters via Zigbee and is actively searching for and selecting the best wholesale rates and applying a fixed markup, which is far cheaper for consumers than traditional fixed rate plans which typically build in as much as 100% markup to cover admin costs and cover their profit margin in case of wholesale rate fluctuations.

So the value proposition is straight forward: what they're doing behind the scenes saves money and that's all a consumer has to care about. A regular customer just needs to plug in the box, link up their phone's payment app, and they're good to go.

And yes, they will be selling cheap traditional plans to customers that don't have internet access, because if they're already a licensed retail electricity provider, why not get that additional revenue if they can beat incumbent firms on pricing?

In terms of energy, The Lattice1 will do a lot more than just pass through cheap wholesale rates - optimizing home power consumption via connected devices and creating passive income streams if the household or business has solar and/or a home battery.

To facilitate all this they built the first next gen hardware wallet from the ground up. Among many other things, it facilitates things like subscriptions and permissioned payments, so, coupled with all of its connectivity the platform will enable crypto based micropayments with all kinds of connected devices.

Grid+ is also a trojan horse for real world crypto usage. Electricity customers who have never heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum will end up with these in their homes just because it saves them money, but crypto nerds end up with a hardware wallet that does far more than an old fashioned devices like a Nano X or Trezor and get a tamper-resistant crypto vault that does out of the box hardware multi-sig and more.

I came across it a couple weeks ago, and it does seem potentially useful, both for smart contracts and other code, including clients.

And not just for correctness. Lamport talks about some software for a NASA spacecraft that was rewritten using TLA+ in the design process. The original code had been written to be compact, but with TLA+ they ended up with such a cleaner design that the new code was ten times smaller.

Installing TLA+ didn't work for me at first on OSX. It turned out it's not enough to install current Java, you also need the JDK.

""Wallet"" doesn't begin to capture what's actually needed to fund and manage personal interest in a good dApp, and wallet ""providers"" do precious little to give users any real functionality besides moving eth tokens in and out of a contract. Is there a wallet that can support NFTs and also leverage Golem's API? Not that I know of.

It's been awhile since I looked at web3's API but we were avoiding it for reason #2. A lot of adoption problems come down to bad UX in moving tokens in and out of wallets and apps. So what you have are ""apps"" that are doing a lot of wallet like things but aren't really wallets. so ... who's node? who's wallet?  and for merchant apps, will it be compatible w/ tokens from multisig contracts? how to code around various edge cases?

The RPC leaves much to be desired and devs shooting up their hands to say ""oh this is too hard / too risky / too difficult"" translates into lower user engagement and practically no hope for retention. the next shiny will probably repeat the same mistake.

Quite literally - the cut-and-paste nature of solidity has led to dApps performing a lot like Zynga games from the old FB days.

Seriously though the point is to have short term stable prices, you cant do that and appreciate in value since in order to have people take the opposite side of the trade (to short DAI while its going up and buy it back when its going down) you first need an asset that the borrowers will expect will go down relative to the collateral long term. Originally that was going to be the SDR but nobody prices things in the currency index and even though DAI is pegged to the USD there is nothing stopping MKR holders from pegging it to some other currency or index or letting it float in value but in any scenario in order to be stable it must depreciate slightly against collateral or you would not have that plunge protection of short covering.

This is routinely present in all liquid markets and the practice is a regular source of price volatility, not stability. Ironically, the bigger and more liquid the market the greater the incentive.
Another issue is this overcollateralization thing. Overcollateralizatiin in financial deals is almost exclusively reserved for typically illiquid assets which remain in debtor's possession.

> An important fact, though, is that the recdao contract is upgradeable by this voting - the dao is controlled by this governance scheme, including the token that is also controlled by the dao. A registered user could sell all of their tokens and still have significant influence over that token contracts administration - which doesn't seem as fair as it could be. A proposed solution is to modify this to take the token balance also into account, but limit it's influence to that user's karma (vote weight = min(token, karma)).

The issue at hand here is that in PoS, when a contentious fork happens, you now have staked funds on *both chains*. This is comparable to suddenly having double the mining capacity.

So to take the example of ETC and supposing something similar to it in the future, people could just fork the chain and validate on both chains using 2 separate nodes. You could also sell your stake on one and double (or whatever based on price) your stake on the other. There would be immediate liquidity between the two currencies.

You'd need to use events, and you would then get the event (and it's parameters, e.g. `address child`) as part of the transaction data once mined. In practice this is a pretty flexible approach as you can ""return"" data from anywhere in the transaction, and provide context with the event name (and emit multiple events) although there is a gas cost to emitting events (relatively small).

As to why this is, I would guess it is because the return value would need to be a part of the consensus data which carries a cost, so having two separate mechanisms (return data for constant / view functions, or calling a non-constant function off-chain (i.e. call not send) vs. events for data that is included in consensus) makes sense to give developers fine grained control.

Swarm City is a decentralized commerce platform with built-in, objective reputation. Users find each other, communicate, and transact in marketplaces, and can create and run their own marketplaces with just a few button taps.

There are many innovative features, but the one that concerns this topic is Swarm City allows marketplaces owners to add custom interfaces to their marketplaces. So rideshare marketplaces can have interactive maps, etc. Retail marketplaces can have sortable products, etc. Swarm City's default interface is craigslist-like, and can be used right now.

5165,"I think there are two problems here:

1) you have an additional barrier to entry in the sense that the app needs to be coin-oped using cryptocurrencies. Breaking it down further -

a) you need to convince people on the street who don't understand cryptocurrencies to accept these fancy new ""tokens"" (existing payment schemes such as credit cards have deep market penetration and do not suffer from this trust-onboarding problem)

b) you then need to convert whatever currency you have into that particular flavour of a token. Let us then assume for the sake of argument that coinbase will let you convert from and into every token (it doesn't currently, and it's unlikely to do that in the future). So then in addition to participating in the actual platform, you need to onboard (and KYC) yourself onto YET another system (existing payment channels do not have this problem).

c) what should a ride cost? is it completely arbitrary, or should those be predefined? in either case that cost in tokens needs to be translated into whatever currency the user operates in and take into account the token-currency exchange rate at the time of the trade. (Uber doesn't have this problem by design).

2) blockchains are still slow, imagine tx fees go up and you have to wait a few minutes to agree on the terms of a ride - ain't nobody got time for that.

5168,"Uber is not as centralized in the perfect sense. Each market it operates in is subject to that market's laws. In NYC, for Uber to operate they have to operate as a livery/car service and each driver/car has to be insured and licensed as per the city's rules. In markets with no taxi regulatory agency Uber can recruit regular drivers (usually the smaller the market the less rules set forth by the city) and have to worry about any extra insurance needed.


I'm actually working on a driver-owned platform and have my eye on how ethereum could play its part. I believe the individual ""nodes"" (drivers and their respective cars) should not be taken 30-50% commission from a software interface (which is ALL Uber is.) 


In NYC there are 100,000 ""TLC"" cars (commercially plated and insured for car service) all independently owned. The low-average cost of each car is $15,000. Also insurance for this type of car can run between $4-5000/year. That means the drivers paid $1.5 billion in equity and another $500 million/year on insurance premiums for Uber to even be able to operate in that market. It makes no sense that a 'million dollar app' can wedge itself into a bloated position. All these apps are is Google Maps (free) glued with a payment processing function.

This automatically centralizes a workable system around the guarantee to the investors that they will be repaid.

5207,"What you're missing is that these services rely on a massive, world-wide collective of people working together to provide rides and any competitor wouldn't have that community in place. Designing a technically decentralized platform would be the easy part.

Uber would be particularly hard to copy because the community around it is geographically distributed so even if you attract random drivers / travellers, if they're not in roughly the same locations their contracts can't be matched. That means logically it has to start out in one place and organically spread to other locations. In the mean time, people in other locations will learn about the service and go to use it but there will be no one there, leaving a bad impression (hmm, lets use this in a contract?)

It's interesting to imagine what a solution to this problem might look like as incentive structure. Something to look to for inspiration might be multi-level marketing. You could imagine people going door-to-door to make sales, and earning a commission on top of anyone else they convince to do it. Imagine that spreading like a virus across a country, only its payload is to convince drivers to sign-up for your app.

If this were designed as a payment protocol (with rules in place to prevent too much competition and overlap so people actually earn money),  it may be possible to solve the difficult chicken-and-egg problem with community building. All of this could be engineered into an initial coin offering to fund a corporation that would automatically pay workers for signing up drivers. The fact that modern cars have so many sensors and the driver + customer would have smart phones on them would also automate auditing / oracles.

Then have everything feeding back into this smart contract corporation:

1. Cars generate revenue from customers which attracts investors
2. Investors buy shares in the corporation to receive dividends
3. These additional funds allow the corporation to hire / fire affiliate workers
4. How to keep this process growing? Is there a better model?  Some magic formula where you spend X automatically to acquire customer that generates more than X for the company with magic token money.
5. Insert other hacks to increase incentive value and mitigate panic + loss of interest.

Basically, just have multiple avenues for explosive growth. Maybe look into what causes multi-level marketing networks to grow or decay and work that into simulations. All part of the smart contract of course. Even use infectious disease simulations to troll /r/ethereum idk. If you're able to balance different people's interests and successfully exploit psychology to keep the momentum going I can't see why this wouldn't work in theory. Not saying it would be easy though.

Both of which Uber is alienating the drivers. I feel a 3rd wave coming soon. Can Bitcoin/ether treat the miners the same way Uber treats the drivers? ,19-02-07-19-10,1,905,CptnBlackTurban,ao1kgn

User A is verified by Twitter/Github/Reddit (you have this already). This User A can sign a Claim (""I am over 18"", eg. ""IS_ADULT"") concated with the ETH-address of User B and store it in the public profile of User B under the claim key ""IS_ADULT"". This is possible already.  
Now a great addition to the 3Box UI would be to allow for a ""real-time"" check for the validity of the claim, which just checks (ecrecovers) if User A actually did really sign the claim (ie. the ecrecovered ETH-address of the signed Claim belongs to User A).

In addition to, that to actually get a transaction into the soonest block your transaction needs to be accessible by the miner mining the block at the time that they're assembling it. Normally, this isn't such a large factor because transactions can propagate fairly quickly to a large number of nodes (less than the avg time between blocks), which is why people normally just mention gas price (in GWEI) when talking about transaction times. You could theoretically speed up the propagation time by propagating directly to miners (mining pools) instead of through ~10 intermediaries, but this would be the difference of fractions of a second out of 14.5s-18s of time between blocks. This would mean that even with this sped-up propagation, it would probably be useful for less than 1/100 blocks (a guess).",19-02-07-03-19,2,1087,blurpesec,ansc8r

Asking for an article 13 compliant blockchain would be similar to implement content filters at the internet protocol suite level something that's implausible to ask for. The same happens to GDPR directives, they are not meant to be forced into the internet protocol suite. So neither directive is going to be forced into blockchains directly.

However, applications and companies created in the EU and operating in the EU are subject to said regulations meaning that, if a company or a developer is the one deploying the dapp then they are the ones responsible to implement whatever content filter is required if article 13 were to pass as it currently is redacted. The same goes for GDPR directives, the company or developer is the one responsible for data protection and fines and all that GDPR entails.

It's still concerning, of course, specially some bureaucrats are suggesting that core developers should be also liable for these directives. A completely different issue, but still concerning nonetheless.

Now for what will happen with dapps, probably the same as regular webapps like youtube, a general geo-blocking in the EU for data storage, transfer, etc. and a block to all potential users located in the EU.

But I expect non-compliant websites and dapps still working in the EU; GDPR and the new copyright directive won't be able to block all content online that is not compliant with said directives, it's well established companies and startups who will suffer the most but sketchy websites offering mirrors of unblocked content will probably be found in the future, just like torrents of pirated content are still available right now.

If the miners are liable, how do you enforce a no mining ban? 

If the uploaders are liable, how do you catch them? 

Of course, the EU could say that it is a crime to so much as download the dapp or host it, but at that point, why not have dns services pushed into ethereum, along with tor nodes?

These are politicians, big money, courts, and men with guns. They are slow. They get caught up in red tape easily. They are blind to reality, and they are very good at catching anyone who is a defined system of control. The reason they are good at rolling criminal organizations is because criminal control is centralized. The reason they are good at taking down businesses is because businesses are physical and centralized. Blockchain, tangle, hashgraph, and block lattice are decentralized, fast, anonymous, and have no control. That means they can roll one person, but that doesn't achieve anything in stopping the network.

5606,"I will try to give you few ideas I think about too, and are bothering me:

1. I think the space misses people like you, who got tired of waiting, tired of reading, tired of writing, tired of expressing their ideas and ideals, tired of missed deadlines, tired of trading (saw trading volumes are super low), tired of changing roadmaps, etc.
2. **You guys need to come from the shadows and start expressing yourself again**
3. I sincerely don't understand why community funding is needed, as long as we have ETH Foundation in charge of grants. And, even if there is no official report on it (or audited like a company...I know ETH is not a company) I understand from the latest ETH 2.0 AMA they have a lot of funding still.
4. I am not sure yet how they decide to allocate those funds. I remember one dev in charge of EVM being pissed because his grant was cut, while eWASM is still far away (I might be wrong). On the same time they give some ETC to ETC development...
5. The fact that Vitalik needs to give from his personal ETH some ""grants"" to those teams you mentioned is fxxx up completely. Why we have ETH Foundation than? What is their focus? Isn't their focus aligned with ETH 2.0 development? Can you imagine you are counting the development of a multi billion dollars network infrastructure that rely on a few teams working after work?
6. How and why [ETH Foundation gives 5 mil grant to Parity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/01/07/announcing-an-ethereum-foundation-grant-to-parity-technologies/) (no offense to them, they really helped ETH, but lately I feel they also kind of lay down and cut some developments, like Parity UI, Windows support \~ I did point out to them these aspects) and why not to other ETH 2.0 teams?
7. Unless you work on ETH as a full time job, it's impossible to keep up with the news, developments, ETH 1.x, ETH 2.0, etc, which is why a lot of people got sick of it
8. I feel lately the space is full of people who don't give a fxxx about anything, all is TL;DR for them, while ETH is a complicated tech, which you need to comprehend
9. **Everybody expects somebody to do something about what is wrong**, but old timers stay hidden (and they are the ones to properly understand the tech probably), new comers are very vocal and oppose or criticize everything, based on false info they saw in different articles (probably...), which gives eth core devs false information about the community
10. From my own point of view, after being in ETH since 2016 also, and have no previous crypto experience, the ETH community is made up of the following: a. Traders b. Investors c. Miners d. Core Devs \~ in charge of layer 1 e. Other devs \~ in charge of layer 2, and/or in charge of different applications of actually using the network to build on
11. **These 5 groups seems totally disconnected from each-other in last 1 year, but probably they all represent the community you are mentioning**
12. These 5 groups used to be more homogeneous because each type was also involved in another type (Core devs also develop as other devs, also mining, traders mining, miners trading, investors investing in mining, etc.)
13. After the ecosystem evolved more and developed more, each one of these groups had to focus on one or maximum 2 things, otherwise I sincerely tell you it's impossible to keep track of. I am saying this as I have days when I try to keep track of all these groups somehow, and I find myself spending 8 hours a day doing it...And have to speed up my main job or come to work during the week-end because of that. And this while my financial exposure to ETH is not worth it frankly, but as you, I believe in this project, and I really liked the ""better BTC"" rhetoric.
14. Lately, I feel I spend too much time on it, I feel that ETH project is not aligned with what used to be at all, I feel in each one of the 5 groups I mentioned are a lot of people who profit of others back and/or have their own agenda against the initial plan, etc.
15. For me personally, I feel disappointing and also that is stupid to discuss if to kick-off ASICs in a project that was from the beginning launched as a reaction to BTC, while one of BTC's problems are ASICs and centralization
16. Some of the groups I mentioned, like for example traders and investors have no idea what ASIC's will do to ETH price, for example. They also have no clue to differentiate between pool centralization and miners centralization for example. They have no clue what nodes need to be upgraded to enable or disable a hard-fork and are critical infrastructure and what is not. Some have no clue that the hard forks we are implementing in ETH are not chain splits, so they keep asking where is their second coin. (on this I agree with Vitalik that we should change the name to upgrades)
17. Decentralization of management and/or software development seems not to work, or ETH has not yet find the proper way to do it.
18. Related to 17, let me show you an example: a. On one side Afri from Parity said this: [“If we don’t stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed.”](https://www.coindesk.com/the-race-is-on-to-replace-ethereums-most-centralized-layer) b. I pointed out to Afri a few problems already, some [mentioned here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aeo44g/know_anyone_who_runs_a_node_tell_them_to_update/edsdrm0), some directly to him, cannot find it now, but I will summarize: Parity UI was a good tool to use while running a full node, which gives you info about the node status, wallets, etc. Parity has discontinued that because they want to focus on something else, which is cool, some others should develop interfaces to connect to it, just that...they didn't yet. Another issue is discontinuing the support for windows users. Based on the fact that nobody at Parity is using windows. c. So by taking out parity UI and by taking out Windows support, you kind of make sure normal users like me and home users will not run full nodes. d. No full nodes means we will rely on other peoples nodes, including Infura. e. Basically it makes no sense, but it is just like I described.
19. Related to 17, what is the ""official"" channel of communication of ETH? Is it Reddit? Is it Twitter? Is ETH blog? What do you need to follow?
20. I am the guy who did [this against Fred Wilson](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/a7jjmh/fred_wilson_ripping_into_the_management_of/ec3nnka), but I also feel that ETH community, all those 5 groups, need to get their shxx together, or this project won't move further fast enough. The world is ready for blockchain, the whole world is watching this experiment, but if all we have to offer is 15 TPS in a decentralized network, the world will find something else, including another better project. If ETH 1.x doesn't evolve further and faster, until ETH 2.0 Phase 2 at least, a lot of people will probably lose interest on it. If ETH 1.x become centralized in the hands of a few who have ASICs, this will become a problem too.

1) This only affects validators. Remember: As a user/current miner today/dapp user or developer, no one is ""paying more"" or giving to ""charity"". So yes, it's only to do with validators, and while it's still extremely early based on DM's and stuff it seems there are a lot of future validators who would welcome this change.

With that said, I want to challenge your thoughts on those two words. Here is why it's not a ""tax"" or ""charity"" and this is my actual mindset and why I am trying to push this forward:

As a future validator this is a protection of my underlying investment [ETH I am staking]. I am ensuring the network I am securing stays as competitive as possible in an increasingly competitive space, and thus my stake I am holding as a validator not only preserves its value but grows over time due to increasingly strong fundamentals. So when people say ""charity"" or ""tax"" to me you are missing the forest through the trees and overlooking this strong point.

Let's take this further: I'm not doing this for altruism and I'm not a hero for wanting to do this. I am doing this for my own selfish reasons -- which is preserving and growing the capital I have staked into our network. Lucky for me this also helps the network and its a win/win. There is nothing ""charitable"" about my reasoning at all -- in fact if I didn't even care about anyone but my own bottom line I would still want to do this. Please consider that framework before thinking of this as some selfless act -- it is actually self-serving in nature, but also just so happens to have positive butterfly effects throughout the ecosystem.",19-02-06-12-04,0,442,kazuya1987,anl49j

It's not Zamfir v. just Szabo.

It's Zamfir versus the CypherPunk movement that gave rise to cryptocurrency. The principle of immutability that shields a blockchain from the interference of any third party is critical to the founding of both Bitcoin:

Implying the scope of the constituency opposed to Zamfir's position is limited to Szabo is misleading.

>Here’s one way to read Vlad’s argument. There are basically three *categories* of “Laws” that structure and inform the crypto space: (1) the blockchain protocol; (2) law; (3) immutabilist ideology masquerading as principled law-and-econ and rights-based argumentation, but which is actually hollow politics-as-law (what Zamfir calls “Szabo’s law”).

This creates arbitrary categories of law, that just happens to put the idea of third party non-interference in the protocol's operation into a category of ""immutabilist ideology"" that, the author contends, is ""actually hollow politics-as-law"".

It's a false characterization of the author's Big Brother pro-centralization ideology as a formal and objective analysis of the facts.

>acknowledging that individual and institutional pulls *towards legality* are, pragmatically, the most secure blockchain development pathways available today.

That is not at all established. For one, it is impossible for any global network to be legal in any general sense, because it is multi-jurisdictional, and jurisdictions have many mutually incompatible laws, so even the premise is unsound.

Second, facilitating third party interference opens up a huge legal and security hole in the blockchain's stable operation. It promotes liability for whatever parties are given the task of acting as the human gatekeeper, and thus promotes the subordination of the decentralized blockchain under whichever jurisdiction the gatekeepers choose to subordinate themselves to.

Third, it creates opportunities for rent-seeking, that will bog the blockchain down in the social strife of legacy political systems.

Fourth, it promotes the prohibition of privacy on the blockchain - given privacy nullifies the effect of any social permissioning mechanism - which facilitates extreme centralization through warrantless mass-surveillance. Centralization is socially fragile and creates massive rent-seeking opportunities that reduce the efficiency of the system.

Immutable blockchains have worked until now, and offer a far more efficient premise on which to govern: observing the protocol. The article's claims that they can't work and will lead to blockchains being suppressed by states are unsupported, and amount to FUD.

Also worth mentioning is that the article doesn't even attempt to address Vitalik's compelling responses to Zamfir's articles, like for example the latest one:

1. You cannot be legal in two jurisdictions with mutually conflicting laws at the same time, meaning that to achieve your goal of making blockchain legal, the blockchain becomes centralized under the jurisdiction of one faction of states.
2. Even if it were possible to be subordinate to all states, the very subordination to a state means being controlled by a centralized state. Your mission of ""making blockchain legal"" everywhere would turn the blockchain into nothing more than a multinational corporation run by lawyers, to ensure legal compliance, with the trappings of cryptographic consensus on top. MNCs are widely recognized as centralized entities. If you want to now argue that the traditional multinational corporation is not centralized, then be my guest, but it'll just show how far your view diverges from the majority of people's.

The point I'm making is that cryptocurrency's original purpose was to protect these rights through technological means, including against government over-reach. What you're advocating would reduce the protection a blockchain offers to whatever is provided by the traditional legal system of some dominant jurisdiction, which would mean the blockchain would provide no benefit in protecting rights over existing systems, and no protection at all against government repression, since being legal implies being in compliance with repressive laws.

On the topic of thesis, if the narrow question is legal control over protocol, that has been explained by Zamfir in a very clear and evidence-based manner in his OP.  And, again, that’s not a “core” thesis nor a “core” assumption of the crypto law argument that Zamfir is making.

>The very core of what we’re about & have been advocating publicly & privately is greater involvement in expert & non-expert stakeholder groups into the blockchain governance & law conversation.

No, the core of what you're arguing is that the blockchain should strive to be legal everywhere. That's the point of divergence between your view and the cypherpunk movement's. How best to do that? Have it run by lawyers, like a traditional multinational corporation, and obviously make it jurisdictionally biased, to avoid trying to satisfy jurisdictions with laws that are incompatible with those of the dominant jurisdictions.

When you claim that the implication of your proposal to keep blockchain legal is not ""*not* subjugation to a lawyer class"", you're suggesting that law experts are not the best people to help a blockchain maintain compliance with the law,  which doesn't make sense.

In any other enterprise, lawyers are needed to maintain legal compliance. Yet now you're denying that this is what would be needed for the blockchain to do the same.

>It also is a low-cost & potentially high-yield legality maximization strategy, in that the greater the buy-in from prospective users & stakeholders

It would turn the blockchain into a traditional multinational legal entity, with all of the centralization and inefficiency that that entails. That's the only way to pursue a ""legality maximization strategy"". This would lead to fewer competitive advantages for blockchain over existing institutions, and less buy-in.

Also, your proposed strategy ""*would mean the blockchain would provide no benefit in protecting rights over existing systems, and no protection at all against government repression, since being legal implies being in compliance with repressive laws.""*

>it’s basic risk mitigation in a dynamic multi-actor environment.

Your proposed ""risk mitigation in a dynamic multi-actor environment"" is to ensure the blockchain complies with all laws of all jurisdictions. It's right there: ""keep blockchain legal"". Which goes back to the points I made in the previous comment, which you have not addressed.

So you're avoiding debating the specifics. You're making a point, and then when challenged on the implication of it, moving onto a different point you made, and avoiding addressing those implications.

Again with this false characterization of your thesis as an inevitability. Given it's not established as an inevitability, it is misleading to call this hypothetical legislation ""pending"".

You need to stop doing this. It's not the right way to interact with others. You can't just abandon truth in the pursuit of some supposedly higher purpose. The process, in the way you conduct yourself, is more important that the ends you are seeking to achieve.

“How Kyokan/Moloch Can Help
Kyokan is a blockchain-native software consultancy based in the bay area. In the past, we have worked with MetaMask, SpankChain, Cosmos, Dfinity, and Uniswap. In addition, we received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation to build an implementation of Plasma MVP, which is currently preparing for mainnet launch. Our team has significant experience shipping production software at prominent consumer and enterprise tech companies.

Moloch is a grant-making DAO / Guild and a radical experiment in voluntary incentive alignment to overcome the ""tragedy of the commons"". Our objective is to accelerate the development of public Ethereum infrastructure that many teams need but don't want to pay for on their own. By pooling our ETH and ERC20 tokens, ETH investors and teams building on Ethereum can collectively fund open-source work we decide is in our common interest.”",19-02-06-09-20,3,129,elizabethgiovanni,anji4w

Agreed, would be nice to directly attribute people to so called quotes.

This gives a very fair reason to doubt our ability to implement Ethereum 2.0.  This isn't about the price of ether at all.

We can't have an underlying assumption or expectation that every user that comes to MyCrypto or a dapp will already understand Ethereum, and I believe that it IS a viable option to educate users inline, within reason.

Sure, it's ideal for each user who comes to MyCrypto to already know what the hell they're doing, but we have to prepare for the people who hear about it on the news or from a friend or family member, see dollar signs in their head, and then dive in.

It's not about trading specifically, it's not about Compound specifically. Compound was used as an example. And even then, the point is not to show and explain everything that's going on. The user isn't asking you to explain what SMTP or HTTP is or how it works, and we don't have to explain everything going on behind the scenes in blockchain either. In fact, most blockchain-related things going on behind the scene SHOULD be abstracted and not visible on the front-end.

Major platforms censor pretty much everything that's right-wing (or more precisely anti-establishment), in addition there's an increasing trend of hostility toward sexual content and drugs (reddit banned tons of related subs).

Affected  Parity Ethereum nodes are those that serve JSONRPC as a public service  (e.g., Infura, MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, and other publically-accessible  pieces of infrastructure).

## Who’s not directly affected?

Parity  Ethereum nodes who don’t serve JSONRPC to third parties on the  internet—i.e., most nodes—should not be directly affected. The default  mode is to not serve JSONRPC publicly.

Well reducing rewards was never in Ethereum white-paper, Inflation was, but it was calculated to be PoS by then. They're disincentivizing miners by lowering rewards. My guess is we'll be down to 1 ETH by the time PoS is ready.

>Miners have to invest in hardware to secure the network

Yes. Much more so than ""investors"" who buy the token. Yet our voices are not well heard over ICOs, Dapps, and Ethereum investors.

>GPUs were the most efficient way to secure the network for a few years.

Correction. GPUs *ARE* the most efficient way to secure any network and keep it decentralized. Is it perfect? No of course not.

>With the release of Ethereum specific ASICs GPUs are not the most efficient way to secure the network anymore.

Slightly incorrect. Current ASICs are not more efficient than GPUs. Because of the DAGGER-HASHIMOTO algorithm. We didn't see like Zcash where ASICs became the dominate factor in a matter of months. It doesn't mean they wont improve overtime and become the dominate factor.  Hence why miners are calling for ProgPoW to be fully decided and implemented. More time wasted means ASICs gain a firmer hold.

>Nevertheless, it is still profitable for miners to mine on the Ethereum blockchain; the status quo is more or less okay for miners or they wouldn't continue mining on Ethereum.

Not entirely true as well. When the issuance reduction comes, miners are losing 25% rewards. Top this on bear-market prices. This is going to force many smaller and large miners out of the game. Only those with access to extremely cheap electric, low overhead costs, or don't care will continue to mine.

>It's a possibility that the next generation of ASICs will heavily reduce the profitability of existing hardware

The problem with ASICs, as we seen with the E3, is there just that ASICs. Everyone seems concerned about PoW mining etc etc. But what happens say we don't fork off. ASICs come prevalant on the network and PoS comes? Hypothetically speaking we're going to see a ton of useless ASIC hardware end up for scrap. There isn't enough ETH-Hash(if they dont fork themselves like UBQ) coins that could handle a shift like that.  GPUs can move to ""ASIC-resistant"" algos in more distributed manner.

>As a result GPU Miners are worried about their investment, while participants in the Ethereum Ecosystem are worried about decentralization

I worry to the extreme about my time and money I invested into the GPU mining eco-system. Wouldn't you?

>Switching to another PoW algorithm can be contentious, as seen in the current ProgPoW debate

It's only contentious because non-miners see it as waste of Developer time, ASIC manufactures see it as a threat, while others aren't too concerned about it at all.

>BUT as long as there is uncertainty about Ethereums mining algorithm / mining rewards the incentive to develop Ethereum specific ASICs is relatively low.

The uncertainty comes from the developers. Does this disrupt ASIC production, I would say no, but as of right now that the ""tentative go ahead was given"" then Yes.

>It doesn't seem completely absurd that a productive, ongoing debate about the mining algorithm without switching to ProgPoW is the sensible choice. The possibility to switch to another PoW algorithm may already be enough to hinder further ASIC development

So your saying to disrupt ASIC manufactures from producing we continue an endless debate about PoW change? that just seem absurd.

I'll give you a quick gist of it, the best I can: Basically a bunch of team got together (Kyber Network, Maker, OmiseGo, BitGo, Gnosis, Airswap, bunch more) and are acting as custodians or merchants for WBTC. So how WBTC is generated basically goes as follows:

Bob has 1 regular BTC. He wants to hold his BTC on his Ether address and trade for ERC20's on chain, so he goes to a custodian (see the teams above) and initiates a mint, where he sends them the BTC and in return he gets a W(rapped)BTC. The amount of Bitcoin is locked away and going to be openly transparent and use a DAO etc. to make sure nothing bad happens. And if they want their BTC back they can just take any amount of WBTC to a custodian and receive BTC.

Or if you don't want to mint it with your current Bitcoin, you can just buy it through KyberSwap or Easwap or Uniswap or plenty of others with Eth/ERC20's. Also if it's not clear it will hold a 1:1 price peg to Bitcoin. So it's essentially just Bitcoin on the Eth blockchain but through DAO governed custodians.

6200,"> EF Security Lead Martin Swende said in the call today that he expects ProgPow to cut difficulty in half, which would in turn lead to lower hashing power being allocated to the network. 

No, that's not quite correct. Progpow is a more difficult hashing algo, so if hardware X does 100 MH/s on ethash, it might do only 50 MH/s on progpow. The absolute number of hashes performed is irrelevant for the security of the chain. 

A switch to progpow means that the hashes/second goes down. That will lead to increasing blocktimes, before the dififculty adjusts -- goes down -- and normal blocktimes are achieved again, with the lower difficulty.  

What I meant was that if there is a split into two chains, one ethash and one progpow, with equal amount of hashing power (measured in e.g. number of GPUs, or watt), then the ethash chain will have the higher `total difficulty`, since the `difficulty` _does_ depend on the absolute number of `hashes per second` (as opposed to the chain security). That muddles the water a bit, and makes it not trivial to determine which one is the 'best'.

> Still, all else equal, a 50% decrease in difficulty ""doesn't sound too good"" as u/Souptacular put it in the call today. 

I'm not sure what he meant. Maybe he meant that it doesn't sound too good that it will be difficult to determine what chain is actually the one that has the most hashpower-support.

**If we assume ProgPow works as expected, do you think its activation will bring more retail miners back to Ethereum by making existing commodity GPU more competitive?** 

I ask because I saw some recent [analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11kFMvdx5ooJhW35EY1oPMKZhGv3GIqexGWOR2VYZGzk/edit#gid=553179493) showing that the recent outflow of hashpower from Ethereum had a lot to do with the launch of Grin.

**Do you think that ProgPow will be enough to retain retail miners on Ethereum post-Constantinople?**

There's no right figure for *sufficient security,* but IMO the optimal outcome (with or without ProgPow) is one where the cost to attack the network is the highest. We can't ignore the possibility where ProgPow activates, block reward is decreased, and hashrate continues to go down. ASICs are barries to entry, but they also increase switching costs, making outflows more expensive. Thoughts on this? Also curious about u/mhswende's opinion on this. ",19-02-02-12-23,1,466,jamesmrk3l,am97o9
6208,"Unfortunately I am no longer qualified to comment on the state of the Ethereum mining network. When ProgPoW was originally released, nine months ago, I was. I was intimately familiar with mining and mining farms. As many people know, cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency technology changes rapidly - what was relevant a month ago is very quickly outdated. I focus full-time on hardware and software and blockchain technology now, so my qualifications have changed. 

I think it's activation will continue to ensure that Ethereum lives up to its intended design goals: being tuned to a GPU card. That's *all* ProgPoW is - an extension of Ethash to fulfill the original design requirements. I spoke to a few people that had been involved in the original PoS -> PoW choice before the launch of Ethereum (way back in the day), but when they proceeded to go forward with Ethash and PoW, it was designed to be tuned for a GPU card. It just...failed to do that, because you have to make sure you're actually using all of the hardware.

Network security is something all coins will always fight with. It has very little to do with how many hashes per second you expend, and everything to do with how much _power_ did you expend as proof that you solved a solution? Expending power does defend you from attack, especially given that electricity is starting to subsidize globally. Mining is not intended to be a profitable, get-rich-quick exercise. Companies exist that do build farms exclusively for Ethereum mining (Genesis Mining's Enigma, for example...). 

I'd also point out that relative network hashrate is important. 

The argument that GPU miners will ditch when profits disappear is no different to the fact that ASIC miners turn off their machines when profits disappear. 

ASICs and FPGAs do hinder participants on your network - if your goal is to have a decentralized userbase, you need to ensure your hardware is as commonly available as possible. GPUs and CPUs are the only hardware, today, that fulfills that requirement (FPGA lovers, sorry, ITAR restrictions hinder adoption in other countries - and ASICs? Seized in russian-bloc countries and in places like Venezeuala, and taxed heavily in the US). 

Moreover, when Ethereum does transfer fully over to 2.0, you'll see those GPUs being able to be repurposed to things like [Vast AI](https://vast.ai/) or VectorDash or Golem or RNDR. You won't be doing that with an ASIC or a CPU. You may see some FPGAs participate - would need a development team for that. ",19-02-02-12-23,2,1523,OhGodAGirl,am97o9

Centralization is problematic, sure. But it's not the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency design to avoid it. Decentralization serves a deeper goal, that being *trustlessness*. There are other ways to accomplish that goal.

A good list to keep up-to-date on the usual suspects. Plasma Bears is pretty good, and you don't have to pay anything. Try it!

Many of the games listed are fairly similar to centralized games they're copying, and there's merit in saying they're not up to par with the Hearthstones and Fortnites of the world. True ownership and interoperability allows for different dynamics, but on the surface, crypto games can look like cheap knockoffs.

Another type of game is absent in high-profile lists: games blurring the lines between ""video gaming"" and dice/poker/chess. These games have perhaps the most to benefit from blockchain.

(Disclaimer, I make games like these. But I'm not trying to convince you to try mine! I make them because I'm passionate about the concept.)

Games like Fomo3D, EtherGoo (now TronGoo), CryptoMiningWar. They don't offer strong visual experiences or powerful narratives. They're not deep mechanically compared to Dark Souls or Starcraft.

But change the perspective: instead of thinking of ""video game + money"", think of ""money game + decentralization"". The crypto games mentioned are more like Poker: you want to learn the rules, define your strategy, calculate your expected value, and make your moves in accordance.

Then, there's the fun part: dozens or even hundreds of players do the same, and your strategy has to be refined to account for that.

Games like these answer the question ""why use blockchain"". You simply couldn't make them otherwise. Money gives incentive to compete, and trustlessness guarantees the ruleset is respected.

It's been argued crypto is a trojan horse for funding open source projects and introducing ideas of freedom, openness and fairer world. Likewise, crypto games can use profit as a motivator to nudge players towards new interesting sets of rules. The scale is much smaller, the goal isn't as grand, but the use case exists!

Now, the types of games I list above have a poor reputation. Fomo3D in particular! I'm not going to argue every developer of crypto games like this has noble goals.

Money games are zerosum by nature. For there to be winners, there will be losers. Each smart contract will have a different balance. In some of them the balance is heavily stacked.

But, this doesn't mean crypto money games have no merit. If someone offered you a dice game in which you bet similar, and you'd win if you rolled a 6, but he'd win if he rolled a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. That would be obviously unfair to you. Should we throw the whole concept of dice out of the window, or just adjust the odds?

As said above, I'm making small games like these. Don't see this as a sale push! Instead, if you're interested in the idea as an observer, I have several Medium posts on the topic. They each concern my own individual games, but there's also deconstruction of mechanics, what works, what doesn't, reflection on goals and incentives... and frankly, wishful thinking someone much more talented than me comes along, sees something worthwhile in these ideas and sets out to make much better games!

6363,"Totally agree, and its worrying to me that sources I though I could trust are so easily duped into swallowing the hype. It is very clear that the authors did only a cursory glance of the games in the space. How many of those games did the authors actually commit any significant time to try them out and evaluate whether they live up to the hype.  


Take Gods Unchained, which has been repeatedly used as an example of a great ethereum game. This has been done from the moment cards went on sale, months passed before they even released a beta that could be played! It is, as of now, still in closed beta. What that means is a very limited number of people can actually play the game at this moment, and from all accounts the game is still very limited in scope with only a fraction of the cards ready to be played in that limited beta.

At the same time there are many games that are already live that people can play which are not even mentioned. This is down to the fact that many people, such as the authors of this article, simply buy into hype and marketing without taking the time to actually verify the reality.

This does not mean there are not games out there that you can actually play, with good gameplay. An example would be [Mythereum.io](https://Mythereum.io) which is available for anyone to play right now. Mythereum is a TCG which requires strategy, does not force players to buy cards, provides free cards that can eventually be forged on chain and sold (after playing 100 battles). Mythereum gameplay mechanisms ensure lower power and free cards are an important part to a balanced deck, allows players to enter and win tournaments for prizes (so far all tournaments have been free to enter), and even has an approach that can onboard non-ethereum people by allowing them to play without a wallet (it lets them claim their assets to an eth wallet when they are ready).   


Even more surprising is the big meal being made about being able to make a statue of a Cryptokitty in GU. This statue is not actually used in the games played in GU!. Yet even before GU announced this cross gaming use of NFTs, Mythereum already allowed owners of Cryptokitties to import CKs. Mythereum allows Cryptokitties to be properly forged into real playable Mythereum cards (Mythicats) whose characteristics are based on the original CK DNA and which are often very powerful in their own right as part of any Mythereum deck. There has already been a tournament that required Mythicats in players decks, with winners receiving ether and cards. These Mythicats can be pulled fully on chain and sold like any other NFT. So another buyer could purchase the Mythicat and even unforge that back to the original Cryptokiity. That is the real demonstration of Cross Game NFTs. 

Yet that isnt what people seem to want to hear. It seems speculation of assets, smoke and mirrors, hype and marketing is what drives this space still. The developers have chosen, to date, not to try and raise millions from selling cards, have chosen not to pay streamers and youtubers, have chosen not to pay referrals, have chosen instead to focus on organically developing a game that is fun to play before seriously marketing it. Sadly that approach doesn't get rewarded these days. 

For me it is a microcosm and sad reflection in our own space of the broader crypto space, where many people simply don't do research and fall for the hype and marketing of platforms like Tron and Eos. ",19-02-02-05-06,1,71,maxedgeronimo,am4vtf

Two examples off the top would be the accomodation to the developer of decentralized server storage, which should be more inexpensive than owning a central server farm and reduce overhead burden.

6389,"Very good questions. I personally believe interoperability is the biggest benefit. 

Interoperability is one reason for game assets to be owned and secured 'eternally'. Some of the most valuable assets in games today are purely cosmetic and the older they are, the more valuable they are. You are correct that many assets will become worthless, but some will not. 

If you are lucky enough to have game assets that are not worthless, you may also prefer to control those valuable assets, instead of trusting them with the game company. That's where blockchain comes in.

While it's true that centralized games could offer some limited interoperability through APIs or within their own network of games, the dream is that blockchain makes game assets so easy to plug into, that a tipping point is reached. Game developers become naturally incentivized to tap into these huge player pools who have spent countless valuable hours earning high levels and rare assets, and would love to use them in other universes.

Liquidity is another benefit. Game studios won't build their own marketplaces when players demand their assets be plugged into the global markets and larger financial network. 

My hunch, when gamers get a taste of true asset ownership they won't want to spend time on games that don't contribute to the 'assets' they own. Accumulate 'eternal' assets that enrich your complete gaming experience and sell them or pass them down to your grandkids. Most importantly, enjoy them.

I can imagine scenarios where players may choose to fork a game if developers decide to censor players or act in other ways players don't like. Also, I don't think you can play GU without owning the cards, its a purely virtual game with more complex deck manipulation, unlike a more simple MTG. Could be wrong. 

Of course, none of these dynamics could play out for myriad reasons. It still needs to be proven that gamers in general care about interoperability and open game economies.

If valid concerns regarding the technical aspects of the spec were to emerge from the audit ofc i would agree it should not be pursued but if not and the only reason for this prolonged inaction is due to the perceived contentiousness and a misguided desire from the devs to appear as not to be favoring a specific side(while their mandate is clear since the ETH whitepaper describe it as ASIC resistant and that was the driving force behind the design of ethash and its chief technical goal.)

More than a month or two of delay and you might as well not make the switch, ASICs will be months away.  It only took 4 months for Monero.

That means there isn't wide spread data availability (other than for the parties immediately involved) for ""explorers"" to be developed on top of them. Imagine Bob an Alice open a payment channel, which requires 1 tx on-chain. Then they send ETH back and forth a couple hundred times. Those hundreds of payments are only sent back-and-forth between Bob and Alice, not to any third party. That makes it impossible to track via an explorer or just statistics.

Some implementations of state channel clients (and other 2nd layer scaling solutions) may add statistic tracking and push data to a centralized provider, but I'd personally avoid implementations that do that unless they're opt-in.

6454,"funfair's 'fate channels' are currently a 1 to 1 channel... ie, player and casino are two untrusted parties.   and are able to run independently created arbitrary dapps (games) in the channel.    each game is a different dapp.   funfair currently has more than twelve games, and rising.

eg: player wants to play a game, and as they sit down to bring their money into the game, the channel is opened for the duration of that game.  every transaction inside the game is off chain, and when the game is over, the channel closes.   the player & casino are the two parties to the channel and both are untrusted.   

one benefit of closing the channel when the game is done means the player doesn't leave funds in the custody of the casino.  it is fully trustless, and appropriate accounting and payments for that game are made to pay the game developer, affiliate their share of revenue, etc.

right now, we are using one channel per game session.  that is the safest way for the player and casino to play as they both get their money back in their account when the game ends, and aren't leaving any funds lying in the channel.  one day, it might be possible to open a channel and switch between multiple games before closing the channel... but we haven't figured out a way of doing this trustlessly, as yet... so it remains as a future research project.

there are other state channel research projects that have r&d on-going, some of which are claiming the capability to keep the channel open and switch between multiple apps whilst the channel is open -  but we aren't as yet confident they've considered all the implications in the real world of context switching dapps provided by multiple third parties and the potential for collusion between two untrusted parties to defraud the supplier of the dapps as there isn't information on chain about which dapps (games) were played.

Developer profit is basically 100% because they mint these kitties at zero cost. That's the gen0 revenue stream. For the other two revenue streams, they take a transaction fee that is shown in the other charts.

It is very difficult to digest, even though you provide good documentation, as this is just too much, it would have been better to release it more modular and accompany this with different blog posts. As it is now, you have already a obviously great code base, but people will have difficulties to get into this easily.  
Maybe a good example use case could help, I really like the Elph demo (https://demo.elph.com/) - not talking about the product itself, I cannot evaluate that, but the demo is really nice. If you had something like this, it would be a good starting point for users as well as devs.

As long as ETH maintains itself as a dominant hashpower chain it doesnt matter if it is on ASICs or GPUs. Certainly not in the next 2 years. If anything, bitcoin has shown that ASICs are secure over long time horizons.

GPU vs ASICs is simply a fight between different power structures in the mining industry. There's a lot of money on the line and a lot of propaganda being spread.

6641,"GPUs are ASICs. The best advice for an independent GPU miner like you right now, and the one few people will tell because it's so unpleasant, is to sell your rig.

ASIC Resistance sets an upper limit to the value of a coin. GPUs are good for small emerging networks and for development. As a long-term chip for PoW they will always be beaten by specialized chips, for technical and business/cost reasons. It would be possible to hold hashrate on Nvidia and AMD if you would regularly change the algo, for example every month, or every 3 months. The problem is, you will see, that noone will work on that. Noone will work on distributing money fairly. The moment someone starts working, they try to make more money flow their way. Why is ProgPOW being pushed so hard? Because the authors have a massive (tens of millions of USD) business interest in seeing it become activated. ProgPOW is a tool to exclude Chinese miners, to then gain leverage over Nvidia in negotiating access to secret tuning information and special chip deals. After ProgPOW is activated, independent miners will be pushed out same as before, only that the money goes to insider GPU miners now, instead of Chinese ASIC miners.

Two questions that pop up in my mind, as an end-user:

1. **How can we avoid that the HODLBank service itself has a way of knowing who withdrew to a specific account?**

\- For instance, is it a bad idea to withdraw to an account on the same MetaMask seed?  I can think of potential leaking of MetaMask account addresses to [https://mixer.hodlbank.org](https://mixer.hodlbank.org).

\- Can the withdrawals be linked to an IP address of the withdrawee? For instance by comparing the time of access to the [https://mixer.hodlbank.org](https://mixer.hodlbank.org) website with the time of a zkWithdraw event on the contract. If so, it might make sense to run a local copy of the website.

6784,"Good summary!

For Q1: To clarify, the service doesn't know which participant withdrawing the funds, thanks to zero-knowledge ring signature computed completely on the client. However, when user opts in for using the shared account (recommended) the service theoretically can log IP of who provided a valid ring signature and make assumption that this IP controls the destination address.   
If your threat model includes law enforcement, then you will need to take usual measures to anonymize the IP address. Which is out of scope for the mixer.  
Also generating signature offline and making withdrawal transaction yourself will hide your IP from our service, but it will link the trigger address (who paid for gas) and destination address, which, in our opinion, is more dangerous and more difficult to conceal properly than an IP address.

HODLBank website can see only the address currently selected in the MetaMask.  
I would say for withdraw transaction, if you really concerned about LE or state adversary, one at least would log out of MetaMask and change an IP.

For Q2: yes, there are many great ideas on things that can add privacy using ring signatures, such as ERC token transfers, anonymous ENS names control and others.

3 participants deposit 1 eth each into ""1 eth x 3 ppl"" mixer. Before capacity for mixer round is reached they can cancel the deposit and get funds back.

With the realization that the PoW chain will live on 2-3 years as ETH 2.0 is rolled out and a decision to stick with ETHASH someone with access to next-gen ASIC miners (ie. Innosilicon) can easily make a case to amass a large portion of the ETH hashrate and kill most GPU miners. The tens of thousands of GPU miners that exist today will not go ""Oh well, I just lost my GPU investment so let me throw some more money down and figure out how to import a super rare ASIC from China"".

First of all nvidia and AMD are not going to get in bed together to collude against potential competitors. That's a barely plausible scenario to begin with, these two companies are ultra-competitive with each other. And if they were to collude against Intel, the last place they'd be concerned about Intel encroaching on them is in Ethereum PoW, which is ultimately small potatoes to both nvidia and AMD. Even if hell froze over and AMD and nvidia worked together to block Intel they'd probably fail anyway, because what you're suggesting is basically impossible to begin with. We're dealing with open source code that runs on general purpose processors. Unless they can literally stop Intel or anyone else from making a processor to run arbitrary code (hint: they can't), how do you expect them to build some sort of wall? None of this is reliant on some proprietary API or library, it's all out in the open. It's not like ProgPoW only runs on CUDA and thus only nvidia cards can run it. When Intel's discrete GPUs hit the market in 1-2 years they're probably going to run the same OpenCL code that AMD does just fine, and there will be nothing in the world that nvidia or AMD could do to prevent Intel from building an optimized version for their hardware.

It's like you're concerned that someone is going to corner the market on addition and prevent competitors from adding 2 and 2 together. It's not a rational fear.

The truth of the matter is that neither nvidia or AMD cares to optimize their chips for mining at the expense of the primary markets of gaming and general purpose compute. Which is kind what ProgPoW is meant to prevent to begin with - it requires so many aspects of the GPU that you basically have to build a GPU to run it well. If Bitmain is going to go 95% of the way to build a GPU just to run ProgPoW, then it wouldn't make sense for them not to go the other 5% as well and compete in the broader GPU market. That would be a great thing for the world IMO - everyone is much better off if fabs are pumping out general purpose chips that bring the cost of computation down for everyone instead of fabs being clogged by computational idiot savants that can do nothing but hash fast, which would drive the cost of general purpose computation up for everyone else.

Exactly.  So, once you realize that etherium mining represents a big chunk of someone's quota this quarter, what do you think they want more:  (a) a version of ethhash that runs best on someone else's customized hardware, or (b) a version of ethhash that runs best on their hardware?

Crypto is a cherry on top of their revenue stream, nothing more. 

Now I know for a fact that both have small internal teams dedicated to crypto and working with miners and developers under the radar - and I also know that both of those teams were directly involved with the ProgPoW team and the development of that software. Changes were made on behalf of both of them. At the end of the day, unlike ethash the current version of ProgPoW is scaled quite neatly where the hash/$ is roughly equal on both sides. Of course AMD miners arent happy about a re-leveling of the playing field. But there really isnt much ground to stand on to call this some sort of nvidia conspiracy. Both sides had input, both sides perform quite well, and both sides are working with the same spec and can use that public information to decide their strategy going forward. This is all way too out in the open for there to be a plausible stealth takeover.

Ultimately how much they end up capturing the market going forward is how well their new cards work with current and new mining algorithms. AMD disproportionately benefited from ethash because they had the right card at the right time. The world doesn't owe them or their consumers a competitive advantage forever.

Something like XRP or EOS are trusted-third-party based platforms, and thus not suitable for high-value settlement applications like token contracts. That's why they pose no competitive threat to Ethereum. According to an analysis done by White Block, EOS isn't even a blockchain, because state transitions are not cryptographically validated:

https://www.whiteblock.io/library/eos-test-report.pdf

>In Ethereum transactions, state transitions result in cryptographically
validated changes to the underlying composition of the
blockchain state as can be discerned through the changes to
the Patricia Merkle Tree data structure. Conversely, transactions
in EOS result mainly in changes to the underlying
database, rather than cryptographically verified state changes
to an underlying blockchain data structure like Ethereum.
As demonstrated by our previous analysis of the EOS
system architecture, the communication model results in
data being invoked through the client to eventually being
processed by Nodeos [4]. All of these actions operate in
an environment that lacks cryptographic validation of the
contracts and transactions. Additionally there is no economic
incentive mechanism that is enforced to facilitate proper
execution in the system. This interaction offers services of a
traditional computing environment with no cryptoeconomic
system, as will be discussed in Section IV. Because EOS
is built utilizing WASM in the context of normal database
architecture, there are no substantial differences between
EOS and what is expected in a traditional client/server
architecture.

&#x200B;

I think you are confusing opening a CDP with purchasing DAI, however. DAI costs a dollar or very close (that's the idea). But when you take a loan in Dai (without selling ETH), you must overcollateralize. That's where the 50% comes from.  The upside of this is that if Eth takes a trip to the moon, you don't get left behind with your Dai. 

&#x200B;",19-01-31-03-18,6,77,ethslee,alea07
6986,"You only create DAI if you want to short sell it. If you think that ETH + whatever you buy with the DAI (most likely more ETH) will go up in value relative to DAI by more than the interest rate on the loan. People who want to use DAI are on the other side of that trade, they buy DAI because they want stable value not leverage into a volatile asset. DAI holders should not be CDP holders. Borrowing DAI just to have it is like borrowing against your house just to pay interest on money sitting in your bank account. No if you are a CDP holder any free DAI you have should be used to pay down your debt  or further leverage otherwise its just costing you money. 

As others are saying if you just want DAI then you can just by it.

You could compare DAI to how the USD gets created. Most of it is lent into existence too. When the Federal reserve buys bonds it creates USD out of nothing but that USD is backed by the debt of the bond creator. The bond creator, typically either a member bank or a government does not borrow the money just to have it. They want to get rid of it and then get back more later. Governments by providing services and then using that as a justification to increase taxes or banks by lending or investing. However the average user of USD wanting to know how to get USD does not typically think that in order to get USD they must become bond issuers in a market where the FED is active. They buy USD on the market using their labour  or if they do borrow it should be for investment or at least coverable by their present or future ability to trade their talents and time for it.  

Maker works very similar to how a reserve banking system works however they do not have the benefit of legal tender law. They cant use the guns of the state to force people to pay back loans so instead they must require enough collateral on loans that borrowers will voluntarily pay them back There is collateral in the reserve systems as well. Businesses and real estate are the real backing of the USD, although some might argue its the US governments ability to force oil producers to sell oil in USD, there is no law forcing oil producers to keep the USD once its bought with oil so such an arrangement is not necessarily holding up the value of the USD in comparison to people and nations being in debt in USD which does create perpetual demand ie foreign loans (mistakenly called foreign aid) especially for unproductive things like war. The USD is backed by an incredibly complex system of power and debt yet the average user of the USD doesn't and really cant know the depth of its complexity yet it mostly works for them with very little cognitive load.

DAI has much less complexity in its backing but it seems more complex because its being introduced and people are looking it over critically because it can be looked at and understood and audited.

We have been working hard for this relaunch with new features, most of them requested by the users
The game still a football (soccer) prediction game but much more easy

New Game: Predict the winner of 13 matches (mainly European Leagues) and win the pot if all of them are correct. The token, still an ERC721 which can be traded but each token is useful for that week in particular. A new token will be required each week. 

Extra feature 1: People can stake ETH to the pot. If there are no winners, you can earn a % of the tickets sold (there will be a pie chart which shows you the % you own). Each week, you can stake as much as you want and there is a 2 day window to claim back your stake + earnings.
The stake is also an ERC721 which can be trade (still need to be publish this part)

* In case there is a winner, you loose your stake as it will be the prize for the winner.


Extra feature 2: Private Leagues. You can create a league and set you own entry fee to challenge your friends and colleagues. You only pay gas + entry fee to create and then it is ready for invite. Cryptocup does not take any fee from the private pools. 
Have a look to the Medium Post for more details

Someone is running a validator on a testnet and his high end pc ~~has trouble keeping up~~ ~~with the load~~. (EDIT 2: The pc is in fact running 12 validators concurrently, two per CPU core. My ongoing ramble about how performance might be on the slow side is thus exagerated) The slow performance is probably caused by the 300 000 participating validators, which are bottlenecking the testnet and making consensus difficult through their sheer number. The code is probably also still not fully optimized so lots of improvements are to be expected in the future. In general the less validators the more performant the network at the cost of decentralization.

In this testcase 10% of all ethereum in existance were to be used solely for staking which amounts to 300 000 nodes. If every ether in existence were to be used for staking there would be 3 125 000 validators. If less ether is used the  consensus overhead should drop of linearly.

If I interpret this [statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9zyv29/when_will_we_know_32_eth_for_pos_is_the_final/eafcvus) by vitalik made two months ago right the current spec should be able to support a maximum of 600 000 validators without requiring outlandishly expensive hardware to run the validators.

7376,"**Summary**

Gods Unchained is a free-to-play digital trading card game built on Ethereum. The game is free to download and includes a core set of 250 cards that can be unlocked by progressing through the game in both single player and multiplayer modes. Card expansion sets, called 'seasons', are available for purchase. The first of these seasons is called Genesis and includes 380 cards. Paid cards are verifiably scarce and have their stats and ownership history recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Gods Unchained also features other collectibles that grant special cosmetic benefits and can be displayed in matches against other players.

All Gods Unchained gameplay occurs off-chain and incurs no transaction fees.

**Activating and Trading Cards**

Purchased Gods Unchained cards can be trustlessly traded using the 0x Protocol. When a card set is first introduced, trading is disabled during an initial balancing period where each card is checked to ensure it doesn't upset the balance of the overall game. The first set of tradable cards in Gods Unchained is the Genesis set.

To trustlessly trade Gods Unchained cards, cards must first be 'activated' using a special transaction that turns them into ERC-721 tokens. Activating cards is not necessary for playing the game, nor is it necessary for trading a card purchased from a marketplace. Activation is only necessary for players wishing to trade a card for the first time.

**Game Mechanics**

Gods Unchained builds on the classic gameplay mechanics made famous by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. New to Gods Unchained is an innovate new mana system that forces players to begin engaging on turn 1.

The game also supports a massive variety of possible matches by giving each player the choice of up to five special god powers at the start of each match. Of these powers, four are always regular and one is an ultimate. Regular powers can be activated once per turn while an ultimate power can only be used once per match. Since the game has six gods to play with and each god can use one of five powers, there are 7776 possible match combinations in Gods Unchained. This enables more gameplay variety than has been possible before.

Other gameplay features include a Rune system (i.e. special small spells), an Anim system (i.e. special small creatures) and a special mulligan and first/second turn system.

Gods Unchained also supports Battle Royale style elimination tournaments and is expected to include more gameplay mechanics than any other trading card game at launch.

**History**

*Closed Beta*
Gods Unchained is currently in closed beta. The beta is expected to be opened up to the public in Q1 2019 with a global launch occuring several months later.

*CryptoKitties crossover*
On January 10th, 2019, a partnership between Gods Unchained and the kitty-breeding collectible game CryptoKitties was announced. Between Jan. 10th to Jan. 21st, 2019, CryptoKitty owners were able to forge statues in Gods Unchained, including a special Talisman based on a new fancy cat called Tally the Furrocious. 380 Special-Edition Gods Unchained Aeoncat Kitties were made available for purchase. Each Aeoncat granted its owner a chance to win the exclusive Hypurrion kitty, modelled after GU's Hyperion.

That said, the game is still pretty fun. I've been playing it along side Zombie Battlegrounds (and NovaBlitz to a much lesser extent), and GU definitely is the better card game in terms of fun factor and strategy.  Yes, ZB and GU are blatant ripoffs of Hearthstone, but they each add enough flavor and gameplay elements to differentiate themselves. Obviously the biggest differentiator is card ownership and an open marketplace.  I'm not sure GU could stand on its own against Hearthstone, and it will never compete on the same scale, but the siren song of 'true ownership' for card collectors and NFT traders should draw enough people in to form a nice sized gaming community.

7459,"Nothing at stake: you can't just vote with your ETH balance, you have to lock it into stake, and if you misbehave in certain specific and provable ways, your stake can be destroyed. For example, the classic ""nothing at stake"" attack is to vote your stake on multiple blocks at the same block height, so you win no matter what. With Casper, if you do this then someone who sees both your votes will submit them to the winning chain, which will result in some or all of your stake  getting destroyed (""slashed"").

Long-range attack: this attack can happen in older protocols because there's nothing like proof-of-work to keep someone from making up a long history. In Casper you can't withdraw your stake for several months (let's say four). This means your stake is committed to the real chain for four months back, and a long-range attack has to start at a point older than that. Everybody knows this, so a defense is to have a well-known blockhash from that far back. Vitalik calls this ""weak subjectivity.""

Unpopular opinion, but we can't.

When one spends enough time learning history, technology and human psychology...you realize it's a cycle - you get a particular system that started off idealistic, got corrupted and gets upended by a new system. And then the new system goes through the same patterns.

> However, this logic ignores why consensus algorithms exist in the first place. Consensus is a social process, and human beings are fairly good at engaging in consensus on our own without any help from algorithms; perhaps the best example is the Rai stones, where a tribe in Yap essentially maintained a blockchain recording changes to the ownership of stones (used as a Bitcoin-like zero-intrinsic-value asset) as part of its collective memory. The reason why consensus algorithms are needed is, quite simply, because humans do not have infinite computational power, and prefer to rely on software agents to maintain consensus for us. Software agents are very smart, in the sense that they can maintain consensus on extremely large states with extremely complex rulesets with perfect precision, but they are also very ignorant, in the sense that they have very little social information, and the challenge of consensus algorithms is that of creating an algorithm that requires as little input of social information as possible.

7566,"Looking at USD doesn't quite work as the price was also massively up during this time. it's best to look in BTC terms: [see here](https://coinmetrics.io/charts/#assets=btc_log=false_left=averageFeeCurrencyUnit_zoom=1384516478065.004,1520018517913.832). 

Looking at the chart, we can arbitrarily define anything above 0.0004 BTC fees as ""excessive"" (that's $4 at $10,000 per BTC), since that's where the fee crisis kicked off. We need to define a natural baseline for fees since Vitalik is specifically referring to excessive fees. Let's generously say it kicked off on Jan 1 2017 and ended on Feb 09 2018. That gives us an average surplus fee (above the baseline 0.0004 BTC) of 0.000605 BTC. 

There were 108,914,965 transactions that were subject to the ""surcharge"". The aggregate loss to users is therefore 108m * .000605 = 65,801 BTC. Obviously, far less in BTC terms than the Gox hack. The average price over the period (not VWAP, sorry this is a quick and dirty exercise) was $4826. This gives us a ""total excess fees"" paid of $317m. The Mt Gox hack coins were worth $450m at the time (600-850k BTC) and are worth billions now.  

Of course, this is a silly analysis, because those fees were paid, voluntarily, by users to miners to include their transactions in blocks. To consider them lost is prima facie asinine. Even so, Vitalik is using pretty aggressive numbers to make his case. A more reasonable perspective finds that the total """"""loss"""""" was less than Gox anyway. Again, looking at the USD numbers doesn't make a lot of sense. You have to look at what the default fee in Bitcoin terms is, rather than being awed at the high USD fees which were a function of appreciation. No protocol indexes its fees to USD, not Bitcoin, not ETH, so it's insane to expect Bitcoin to hold fees constant in USD terms.

7567,"Unless, of course, the majority of those transaction fees were on transactions the miners were making to themselves, a theory that has some circumstantial support (chiefly, that transaction fees plummeted after the BCash split, despite transaction volumes not really decreasing).

A lot of people also pointed out that a good chunk of the block space was taken up by repeated transactions of similar, very large values (i.e. 300+ BTC), as if someone were simply shuffling the same huge chunk of Bitcoin around repeatedly.

After all, if you want bigger block sizes (because they can lead to more fees), what better way to convince users they need it than by filling blocks with your own transactions? The net cost to the miner is 0, since they can simply just not broadcast the transaction (except with the mined block), removing the risk that they pay some other miner. Or they collude, at which point it all roughly equals out.

This comes with the added bonus that all the miners make more off of all the other transactions, as well.

It's worth noting that I've brought this tactic up before with regards to Ethereum gas limits, as well. ""Block stuffing"" is a pretty straightforward tactic for a miner to make more from everyone else, and all miners are incentivized to play along, because it's not like people will just stop using the network , *especially* during a bull run ;)",19-01-27-03-59,1,410,DeviateFish_,ak2lsl

Pascal's Wager is an argument in philosophy presented by the seventeenth-century French philosopher, mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662). It posits that humans bet with their lives that God either exists or does not.

Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).Pascal's Wager was based on the idea of the Christian God, though similar arguments have occurred in other religious traditions.

I guess look at it like this. People who hold the values of things like liberty, (free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press), Blackstone's principle, privacy, etc, are required by our own principles to give voice to authoritarians who oppose those values. But they themselves will lie, cheat, steal, kill, blackmail, and silence anyone in order to eliminate the systems which ensure the rights provided by those values.

3. The Lightning Network cannot reliably route regular and larger sized transactions. 99% of txs with values greater than $200 were failing as recently as six months ago. This is a fundamental problem too, because it's due to the amount of collateral locked up in channels, which cannot be increased without incurring a higher cost for nodes.

Except that you have invested your money into mining hardware that is tied to the long term performance of this coin, generally a 2 year plus ROI timeline.  Driving away adoption today to make a little extra in fees right now HURTS your long term ROI.  This exact reason is why, counterintuitively, MINERS have always been the ones pushing for a blocksize increase.

This strategy only works when blocks are already so full that some other miner cannot simply lower the fee floor back down right after you raise it.  Basically when the coin is already screwed.

Imagine that you live in a country where it wasn't possible to amend laws and that if you would want to change the law you would need to start a revolution. That is unworkable.

Unfortunately the only ""governance truth"" that exists in the crypto world is ""People that have the authority to merge pull requests, can merge whatever they want"". The reason why BTC still has 1MB blocks is because the people that control the BTC reference implementation decided to keep it at 1MB. The only reason why ETH rolled back the DAO hack is because the people that have the authority to merge pull requests in ETH decided to do it. Everything that BCH does happens because the lead developers of the BCH reference implementation want to do it. If anyone doesn't like what they do, then thats tough luck. The only recourse is to fork. The truth is that those who have the authority to make a new release of a cryptocurrency reference implementation are pretty much monarchs.

When you buy BTC you are agreeing to accept the BTC developers as absolute monarchs that can do whatever they please and there's nothing you can do about it. When you buy BCH you have to agree to accepting the BCH developers as absolute monarchs that can do whatever they please.

A Human Capital Contract (or ""HCC"") is a finance product that allows for the provision of funds to an individual through an ""equity-like"" arrangement, where the provider of the funds receives a portion of the individual's future income for some specified period of time.  Human Capital Contracts have been advocated by a number of Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Milton Friedman, Robert Merton, and Gary Becker. Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations described the knowledge and skills of workers as a form of Human Capital.Human Capital Contracts are characterized by an initial investment amount by the capital provider, followed by a series of periodic dividend payments made from the receiver of the capital to the provider.  These payments are variable in amount, proportional with the capital receiver's income, and may never total the initial investment amount made the capital provider.

>From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside.  
>  
>Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)?  
>  
>For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse.

When it comes to sharding and deciding the separate shards:

* Is there a way to use the starting hex values or ending hex values in a specific order as a shortcut to a specific shard?
* Obviously anyone else could make the same starting/ending values with (almost) countless different possibilities, including any ""bad actors"", but even then the EVM was able to move the beginning of the account without having to read the entire account address.
* This could, hypothetically, reduce transaction time between shards, because your primary shard can read a beginning of an address to send to, communicate to the other shard about the transaction, and send the transaction.

8069,"My question is regarding a rather humanitarian topic, and touches on a lot of aspects.

I believe that many of us support cryptocurrency as a way to protect themselves from a global financial sector that has gotten out of control. I also view it as a way of protesting the unchecked printing of currency by these overpowered financial entities, thus devaluing the native-currency (and savings) the average person owns. A transfer of value from the bottom to the top is implied. The current generation suffers from this, and inequality has been on the rise for decades now.

Currency seems to be the medium that pretty much dictates the way a society operates and functions (for instance a state-controlled fiat-currency could be inflated to finance healthcare, pensions, the military, etc. - or - banks can create new currency and stuffing the same pockets over and over again). I don't think anybody here would argue that privatizing the immense power of the 'printing-press' was a catastrophe. Abandoning the gold-standard to get out of the The Great Depressing seems to imply that a BTC-model (a gold-standard) isn't a good idea either.

So who should govern the printing-press? I am a firm believer of the idea that money has, and always will be a, a political instrument.  In a Proof-Of-Stake system, it would be the stakeholders (i.e. the owners) who govern the blockchain, thus controlling the 'printing-press'. What is your philosophy regarding this?

8094,"> The Polkadot team has stated their chain might launch by the end of the year. Why should people/devs bother to go to the Beacon or to wait for its full sharding when they can just go to the Parity chain or somewhere else?

It bugs me that no one answered this... especially since it's the highest ranking question by far with no answer. 

Assuming no ETH 2.0 delays, Polkadot will have at launch a 1-2 year head start on scalability. Plasma probably won't be able to support stateful smart contracts until around that time so it won't be a factor. So that means dapp devs who need scalability (e.g. to establish a competitive business lead) may migrate to or start their builds on Polkadot instead, and thus would have to do more work to port their dapp to ETH 2.0 if they wanted to come back, making it less likely they ever will. And the fact that ETH 2.0 will require existing ETH 1.0 dapp devs to learn new tools and concepts, and potentially even re-write their dapps for ETH 2.0, may tip the scales in favor of building on Polka for the next 2-3 years—especially since it's the most ""value aligned"" with the ETH community, unlike most other smart contract platforms. 

Not trying to fud here, and there are a number of _competitive_ moves Ethereum could take to mitigate this advantage (the most obvious of which being to fork Polkadot to add a way to plug your parachain directly into Ethereum instead of the Polkadot beacon chain so it inherits its security from ETH PoW (1.0) / staked ETH (2.0) instead of staked DOTs), but it wouldn't be easy to do. 

So I guess a follow-up question would be: Was the motivation behind the current roadmap to get the shortest path to full sharding, considering only as secondary external factors like competing platforms, developer experience, and the price of ETH? 

It's probably _wayyyy_ too late to suggest this, but would it be potentially beneficial to split PoS and Sharding into their own separate milestones as was originally intended before ""Shasper""?

I imagine the PoS part 1 would be (eta Q1 2020):

- the beacon chain + 1 ""shard""
- get rid of PoW
- add staking contract + rewards
- reduce block times a bit (ideally 4-8s)
- increase throughput a bit (2-3x bigger blocks)
- cut all sharding stuff until part 2 (eta Q2 2021)

The motivation for doing it this way would be:

- my guess is that while Shasper combined PoS and Sharding from a research perspective, from an engineering perspective PoS is a subset of Shasper, meaning it could be shipped in totality first
- frankly the phase 0 beacon chain is not particularly compelling for dapp developers (and could even be demoralizing if expectations are not properly managed), and time spent on ""sharding stuff"" during phase 0 could instead be used to ship a much more complete PoS that will provide immediate utility
- moving away from PoW and going all in on PoS will lock up a lot of ETH, potentially increasing the price of ETH and the leverage of the ETH community (which could help accelerate the remaining ETH 2.0 dev)
- actually delivering on PoS as originally promised will combat the narrative that ""Ethereum will never deliver"", building confidence in its future, especially from dapp devs deciding what platform to build on

Right. The good news is that Ethereum 2.0 can launch just fine without VDFs, so we're not betting Ethereum 2.0 on the success of VDFs. The current plan is to have VDF hardware ready in 2020, but 2021 would also be acceptable.

The reward/penalty constants are certainly not yet finalized and could use more community debate and input. That said, the rate does scale depending on the number of validators participating.

Specifically, only validator balances exist in the Beacon Chain. User balances and state exist in the shard chains.

Validators will move to the beacon chain to seek profit by providing security and resources to network.

Users will move to the shard chains to participate in the new scalable, sharded landscape.

>How exactly do you envision the move to happen?

&#x200B;

At first, this will just be a single directional deposit for validators only to begin validation. Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer eth directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards. The current most favorable strategy from our perspective is to fork the PoW state root into a contract along with an EVM interpreter. Users could then execute txs on the existing eth1.0 state by call the contract along with the merkle witnesses of the state they need to access. This option is nice because it allows us to cleanly deprecate eth1.0 support in the long term.

This idea came to me when I found [https://vanity-eth.tk/](https://vanity-eth.tk/).  I realized that generating a custom ETH address has a probability associated with the likelihood of another address starting/ending with the same hexadecimals.  The probability for determining starting/ending hexadecimals are the same, so for these examples I'm keeping it simple and using the starting values of an address.

Disclaimer:  I don't have the technical experience to calculate the hex probabilities, so these assumptions are from the website and may not be 100% accurate.  I also don't know how the byte-size of the address impacts overall performance (if we are interacting w/ a smart contract and using another address as a parameter, would an address starting with 0x0000 require less computations than one starting with 0xFFFFF ?).

If you're looking at an address in ETH 2.0 that starts with 6 case-sensitive letters, is there a way you'd be able to quickly determine (with high probability) that a specific shard would have the address?  Now that I'm looking at this problem more conceptually I guess it doesn't matter what the address starts with if it is the primary address associated with a shard (like an exchange wallet).  If you're trying to transact with the wallet from a different shard you don't have to read the entire address to have a high confidence that the address is correct, and instead could use the starting couple hexadecimals to point your transaction to the correct shard.

This means you should have fixed reward regardless of stake, so that the smaller the stake, the higher the ROI, which encourages lots of little stakes.

Is it possible Polkadot won't launch a scalable system in 2019? Honestly, if they do solve scalability in 2019, that would be a huge achievement and they deserve traction. Dfinity is also making claims of launching a scalable system in 2019. Time will tell!

PoS and sharding *are* split into separate milestones (namely ""phase 0"" for PoS and ""phase 1"" for sharding).

There's no sharding stuff in phase 0! It's a very clean separation of concerns between phase 0 and phase 1.

Going ""all in on PoS"" (i.e. ""all out on PoW"") is non-trivial:

* It requires a robust finality system. I wouldn't be ready to bet the future of Ethereum on a finality gadget that hasn't been thoroughly tested in production.
* It requires the community to agree on removing PoW completely, requires light client infrastructure for the finality gadget, and requires all Ethereum 1.0 nodes to upgrade their fork choice rule to listen to the finality gadget.

We are years away from moving all out on PoW, even if that was our only focus.

The main challenge as I see it is that the beacon chain is currently actually quite light on state and computation, with a state size permanently under 1 GB (our decision to replace hash onions with BLS actually cut it down by ~256 MB, hooray!), and the current 1.0 chain is comparatively much bulkier, so it would be a serious tragedy if we were to lose the gains in lightness from the 2.0 switch.  So we need to make PoW state execution a voluntary thing that only a subset of interested nodes engage in.

We could accomplish this by adding a new field to beacon chain blocks, ""eth1 transactions"" that from the beacon chain's point of view is just a dumb data field 16 kb in size. Each proposer could choose what data to include, and from the PoV of protocol validity it could be anything. To avoid requiring all proposers to care about the eth1 protocol and state, we use one of the indirection techniques that we came up with ~1 year ago where specialized nodes come up with proposals, pay fees to the block maker that includes them, and then those specialized nodes claim revenue from transactions (eg. JMRS could be appropriate here).

We then have a separate game for communicating state roots to those who are not interested in sequentially processing every block in the beacon chain. If we're ok with lower security in exchange for simplicity, we could just repurpose the current PoW chain voting scheme for this, or if we want more security we could go through the pain of implementing a truebit game.

Not necessarily saying this route is worth the costs (I just came up with it today!!), but if the R&D team has enough parallelization capacity and the community wants it, it could totally be doable, and it would (i) end PoW level issuance more quickly and (ii) give users real benefits like a 2.5x reduction in block time and faster confirmation and finality.",19-01-25-00-11,12,11041,vbuterin,ajc9ip

> Agreed! At this point delivering PoS (Phase 0) is a key goal for ~30 researchers and implementers. Hopefully 2019 :)

It's such an incredible shifting of goalposts to call phase 0 ""PoS"" relative to the PoS that was originally promised (more scalability, shorter block times, get rid of PoW) and every time I see it feels like trying to save face. If the PoS part isn't contributing at least _the majority_ of Ethereum's security I wouldn't say it's ""delivered"". And again, the phase 0 to be delivered has nothing in terms of tangible benefits to dapp developers, so it's hard to get excited about. 

> Is it possible Polkadot won't launch a scalable system in 2019? Honestly, if they do solve scalability in 2019, that would be a huge achievement and they deserve traction. 

Yes, of course. I was just assuming current trajectories hold, Polkadot / Phase 0 both launch by EOY 2019 or early 2020, and then Phase 1 in 2021 and Phase 2 in 2022. I was also assuming that by EOY Polkadot will have cross-chain messaging / pooled PoS security by launch, so if that's not the case then they won't have as much of a head start. 

Dfinity may have ""top cryptographers"" that makes ETH research team swoon but Parity has veteran open-source blockchain devs and a strong culture of _shipping_ production software. Engineering is frequently the bottleneck—I would bet on Polkadot over Dfinity. Also Dfinity has completely abandoned the cypherpunk ethos in trying to find its niche appealing to large enterprises, so many of us who care about Ethereum's culture and community are unlikely to find it appealing.

> There's no sharding stuff in phase 0! It's a very clean separation of concerns between phase 0 and phase 1.

I get that this is how you're thinking about it, but my point was that if you raise the bar for PoS _delivery_ to ""majority of security"" from ""PoC toy"" it's a little more clear that there isn't a clear separation of concerns between PoS and Sharding. To give an example, the alternative would be:

- Phase 0: Beacon Chain / Hybrid Pow + PoS
- Phase 1: Beacon Chain / Full PoS
- Phase 2: Sharding

See what I mean?

> I wouldn't be ready to bet the future of Ethereum on a finality gadget that hasn't been thoroughly tested in production.

Totally agree with you here, and I admire the attention to security. But it makes me wonder that if this particular point is true today, it's probably also been true for _the last 5 years_, which then makes me wonder why more emphasis wasn't placed on shipping the dumbest possible version of the PoS finality gadget by now in order to prepare for the next year? Is it because PoS / Casper research was still uncertain? Is it because a great deal of research effort was directed at sharding so it was harder to finalize PoS? Not trying to point blame, that wouldn't be constructive. Just generally curious.

> It requires the community to agree on removing PoW completely, requires light client infrastructure for the finality gadget, and requires all Ethereum 1.0 nodes to upgrade their fork choice rule to listen to the finality gadget.

I think this is probably easier than you're making it out to be. Removing PoW has been the plan all along. Light client development is engineering constrained. All ETH 1.0 nodes will have to upgrade their fork choice rules anyways, right? Maybe I'm missing something.

True. What I should have said is that there will likely be a middle gulf between small mom + pop validators and commercial entities. if you cross a certain threshold, it will make economic sense to just bump up to a full node for every shard. You might even save money with an AWS deal!

8359,"Frankly, considering the limitation, we can also assume the ""high-reward"" associated with ""high-risk"" could come from the fact that there won't be too many people doing it. But of course it's impossible to estimate.

But my concern reg Phase 0 and later 1 is that you get no fees since no transfers and smart contract interactions are being done. Therefore we only rely on inflation.

Phase 0 doesn't require 10m at all, I think 10m is the estimation sweet spot for Phase 1 or later, when sharding comes.

If we rely on inflation, getting more reward while still rely mainly on POW, means we either increase the inflation overall, or that we limit the POW rewards even more. Miners even currently are on the edge of a cliff already (ETH rewards will be cut by 30% in end of Feb). (I just looked, with a rig of 6 RX580, most common for ETH mining, price for power 10 cents, which is the WW average, current diff and current price, they are losing 4 USD cents a day...so basically you just burn power)

So if you increase inflation, price will get lower, we will have ""less at stake"" let's say.

If you limit the POW rewards, hash-rate drops, possibly sacrifice decentralization of ETH 1.0 which will rely on ASICs only, risk of attacks increases, etc.

> I would definitely not recommend making the PoW chain's security dependent on PoS until it has been stably running in production for 6 months (or even longer)

Totally agree, I think we all want to move faster but not at the expense of blowing ourselves up. 

> if we want to, there definitely are ways that we can retire the PoW chain fairly quickly and move eth1-related activity to the PoS chain.

Neat! I'm going to break down your points and see if I can make sense of them. Some of this might be repeating what you said in my own words, so I apologize if it's repetitive. 

1. The PoW state execution that happens on every full node for every block is currently large (? GB), and on the beacon chain it is less than 1 GB. We want to keep the beacon chain light (I'm assuming this will speed up block processing a lot, right?) so we can't force _every_ ETH 2.0 node do the PoW state execution. 

2. So to keep PoW state execution _optional_, we add a separate 16kb data field in the beacon chain block for ""eth1 transactions"". Some ETH 2.0 nodes can run a special version of the node software that can include eth1 txns in the beacon chain block, validate them, and earn tx fees (just as miners earn tx fees today).

3. Pardon my ignorance, but what is JMRS? The only mention I found of it was [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rkDgPLqRm) and the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGI3yyq7bq-RT3TyGFXN8bkiFdWdArM2yQzo-FMUjSY/edit) didn't reference it directly. 

4. There is a separate ""game"" for those interested in validating eth1 txns but _not_ interested in processing every ETH 2.0 beacon chain block to communicate ETH 1.0 state roots. Did I get that right? I think I'm confused because I don't know if the ""specialized nodes"" will be running the full beacon chain as well or not. 

5. Repurposing the current PoW voting scheme for this - I guess you mean how PoW nodes can indicate which chain they want to fork to? The reason this sacrifices security would be because none of the beacon nodes would be running the full state execution, only accepting votes by a majority of the PoW state executors (the specialized nodes). Implementing a truebit game would provide more security but would be more complicated to do (maybe this would be  good first application for truebit to ship?)

I guess I have a dumb follow-up question: You've previously talked about ETH 1.0 finding it's home as an ETH 2.0 shard - would it be possible to make it... a special first shard? That way the beacon chain wouldn't have to include the state execution, but the PoW shard would also be secured by PoS, with rewards going to the validators. I imagine this is what we are trying to avoid doing all at once (we want to test PoS for at least 6 months in production first). So maybe a possible compromise is to add a phase 0.5 with a beacon chain + singleton pow shard that would ship ~6 mo after phase 0, provide more incentive to stake, and faster finality? 

> Not necessarily saying this route is worth the costs (I just came up with it today!!), but if the R&D team has enough parallelization capacity and the community wants it, it could totally be doable, and it would (i) end PoW level issuance more quickly and (ii) give users real benefits like a 2.5x reduction in block time and faster confirmation and finality.

Also not sure if it would be worth the cost, and I don't think we should be investing too much in soon-to-be-obsoleted development, but I think it could be worth it to spend some time thinking about this now? I feel at least somewhat validated because, as you said, after thinking about this a bit you were able to come up with this new route. Also in terms of timing the longer we wait to think/discuss/decide on this the higher the coordination and switching costs would be.

I don't see how PoS without sharding significantly improves scalability. I think the community was a bit confused on that point for a while.

> there isn't a clear separation of concerns between PoS and Sharding [...] See what I mean?

Not really :) There *is* a clear separation of concerns between PoS and sharding in the current roadmap.

> why more emphasis wasn't placed on shipping the dumbest possible version of the PoS finality gadget

I think the emphasis of the current roadmap is on shipping something maximally ""right"" (as opposed to maximally ""dumb"") from a holistic/systems point of view.

> All ETH 1.0 nodes will have to upgrade their fork choice rules anyways, right? 

Ethereum 1.0 nodes do *not* have to upgrade their fork choice rule for phases 0, 1 or 2 of Ethereum 2.0. Actually they don't need to fork at all :)

> Was the motivation behind the current roadmap to get the shortest path to full sharding

Not at all! The shortest path to full sharding would have been the sharding manager contract (SMC) route. Arguably the current roadmap is the *longest* path to full sharding. We're getting the foundations right with the beacon chain.

For some historical perspective, I joined the EF in December 2017 and I wrote a [sharding spec](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec-retired/1407) in March 2018. That old design is a piece of crap compared to the latest Ethereum 2.0 design. It was definitely worth spending the 10 months of research, and we finally feel we have something of quality for implementers to embrace.

> considering only as secondary external factors like competing platforms, developer experience, and the price of ETH?

Competitors and price of ETH are indeed external factors—they do whatever they do—hence somewhat outside the immediate remit of fundamental research.

Correct, though I would say that nodes that don't run the special software could earn some of the fees too; because there could be an efficient market where nodes that do know what the eth1 transactions mean could pull together some transactions that pay X fees and pass them on to an eth1-unaware node in a wrapper that says ""these transactions now pay fees to me, but if you make a block including this wrapper you're guaranteed to get paid X * 0.9"".

Yes. As a conceptually trivial but difficult-to-implement version of the game, imagine a system where nodes that wanted to learn what the eth1 state root is would receive a series of SNARKs; each SNARK would say ""given that the state root at block n-1 was X, and the hash of the data field in block N was H, the state root at block n is Y"".

If you did actually try and kill ETH 1.0 the most likely outcome would be a very contentious hard fork. That would sever the peg and to whatever extent the fork had value, it would have diluted or “stolen” it from ETH 2.0, which is the opposite of the intent of killing it.

- Phase 0: Beacon Chain / Hybrid Pow + PoS
- Phase 1: Beacon Chain / Full PoS
- Phase 2: Sharding

Wouldn't creating a stronger PoS system (fungible tokens and the primary source of security) as stage 0 of the Ethereum2.0 upgrade help with price/security because then there would be more reasons to hold ETH (staking rewards), thus increasing the usefulness (and value) of the token?

8511,The collateral is in Eth so if you put in 1.5 Eth you get the equivalent of 1Eth in DAI. Then if the loan defaults your 1.5 ETh is liquidated to cover the loan. Or at least that’s my understanding,19-01-24-08-07,1,334,astrobro2,aj4ism
8512,"What's interesting is that what's truly relevant for the liquidator's profit margin is not the collateral percentage but the size of the loan. For example, a loan with a value of 150 Ether that falls to 148% collateralization ratio allows almost 2 ETH worth of collateral to be seized at 5% discount. In comparison, a .1 ETH loan won't be worth the gas to liquidate, even if it falls to 105%.

So the answer to your question is, a variety of percentages, depending on the size of the collateral available to seize. Usually I will bite after like .5 ETH is available, but it also depends on the type of currency and the ease of shifting it to the exchange. The liquidator must bear the risk of fluctuations in market price during the interim between liquidation and selling on exchange. ",19-01-24-08-07,2,25,Michael_of_Judah,aj4ism

I think about it in the exact same way you do: if I want 50 DAI, I'll sell my X ETH for that 50 DAI. Done. 

The way traders / financially-savvy people look at it is different. When they buy like I am buying, the look at it as ""buying for life"" or ""buying for the foreseeable future"". When they borrow to buy, they are making a calculated series of steps that will net them some profit in the short term. 

Rather than buying DAI (or perhaps something like REP that has volatility makes more sense) and then selling DAI, they are borrowing to gain more exposure to that market in the very short term. It also helps ensure the buy-back price, rather than relying 100% on the market (although you are still partially relying on / betting on the market).

The biggest difference between how you and I look at it and how my husband or dicreetlog look at it is this: they consider the funds they locked up in order to borrow as still ""theirs"". It's a known thing that they have. I look at it as: this is not in my possession, I cannot spend it, therefore it's not ""mine"".

8619,"I suggest uncle rate correlates with the rate at which new rigs are joining (or leaving) the mining ecosystem. 

Back before about July, mining ETH was very profitable (about $1 per TH/s/h).  As the price collapsed below this level, we are seeing successively lower shelf equilibrium levels closer to $0.50 per TH/s/h.

ETH [edit: uncle rate] is at a historic low because fewer consumer rigs are entering the market, and the increases in hashpower are based on consolidation of mining in low-cost operations and a thinning of high-cost operations.  

Cost of operations is hugely correlated to consumer mining, so absolutely we should expect to see, and in fact are seeing mining centralization.

As to your point 2.5,There is no evidence of ASIC mining however.  At least not that I can see.  Hashpower continues to fluctuate in line with price/profitability of miners.  

ASIC mining being the most profitable mining means that they will be absorbed into the ecosystem as fast as they can be produced, so we should see the same sort of production-rate-limited increase in hashpower which we saw during the GPU scarcity.  If ASICs were available, they should be pouring into the ecosystem in high numbers (because that's how ASICs roll, you don't just make two of them, you make thousands of them... per day...).  We aren't seeing this.   So I would say that the high-profitability mining operations are increasing scale at a conservative rate, while the low-profitability mining rigs are exiting... 

Consolidation is inevitable in any maturing economic market.  Ethereum mining is a maturing market, and we should expect consolidation.  The decision to drop mining rewards by 1/3 is additional nudge in that direction.

I've mined Ether since Dec 2015 and scaled up my operation in June and October of 2016.  I'm making LESS money than I was back then now, running with the same 470s and 1070s I had back then.  There's no way that people that got in during the 2017 boom haven't gotten out that weren't ""In"" before.  They would be losing copious amounts more than they invested.

ASICs are propping up the difficulty, and even if the difficulty keeps fluctuating with the price, that's because regardless of the efficiency of the ASICs, they still use power, and power isn't ""free"" on that scale anywhere in the world.  I wouldn't be surprised if some large farms out there have monitors that ONLY have their equipment mine when the price is at a certain hash per watt profit.

ASICs need to be forked.  They don't encourage consolidation, what they do is propagate centralization, by removing the incentive from the poor, and placing it in the hands of the rich only.

8626,"From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside.

Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)?

For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse.

Thanks for your work!

Will it be possible with sharding to have shards with different rules and/or technology independent from the other shards/beacon chain, but still using the same base tech in terms of transacting and security? For example: private eth network run in a shard connected to main eth network from which it takes just security from validators. Private transaction with ZKsnarks shard(s). Encrypted data shards. Erc20 like coin launched on ETH 2.0, but with it's own rules and maybe own shards somehow controlled by the smart contract of that erc20. I think could be hard to understand my question, so I am wondering 2 main things, plus a few others:

1. Can I make a Zcash coin on ETH 2.0 for example with all or most of the advantages of Zcash?
2. Can all the enterprise private ETH 1.0 chains move to public ETH 2.0 chain, but still use their ""chain"" in a private way maybe in their own shard? In this way they could get the security offered by main ETH 2.0 chain without the trade-offs they are currently facing using the main?
3. Why is ETH 2.0 Phase 0 even needed as a ""main"" chain, and need Bether transform from real ether (hence risk losing some value), instead of doing a testnet only, because after all this is what phase 0 is, based on TestnetBEther?
4. As I understand, basically we will lock 32 ETH in a smart contract, which will issue us a ""proof"" that we can use to stake on BeaconChain (eth 2.0\~phase0).Does/Will the smart contract run in ETH 1.x in charge of Bether allow transfer of ownership of the 32 ETH (or the respective ""proof""?)
5. Shouldn't the smart contract stated in (4) have the ability of sending just 16 ETH for something as RocketPool v2 work (while some consider this to be ""centralization"" I think it will help a lot the average user and mitigate the risk of the average user)?
6. As I remember, running a full node in ETH 2.0 ""beacon chain"" for staking, is not the same as running a full node in ETH 1.x. I remember you guys re-think what a full node means in ETH 2.0 (sorry if misunderstood, hard to keep track of it). People are still confused and think you will need at least a very big SSD to do that. Some clarifications are needed in this area. As well as minimum specs that should be ok for all ETH 2.0 phases. The nodes set-up now should cover all future phases, or at least 5 years or so. However somebody just said this:[""Validators presently require a full-node. It doesn't have to be your full node, but you risk penalties (not slashing) if that full-node doesn't fulfill its duties. You should trust that full node to be (a) functional and (b) working on the ""main chain"" (i.e., not malevolently preferring some other chain).""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aivyyj/eth_20_researchers_ama_send_in_your_questions/eesuso6/) Others are mentioning Xenon processors and NVME SSDs which will allow only corporate customers running nodes...
7. I see a lot of people talking about nodes running in cloud. Shouldn't ETH find a way to actually discourage this? If everybody is running nodes in cloud that means we have possible single point of failure, which is against what I think we are trying to achieve and what enterprise customers are looking to eliminate.
8. How much is the ""block time"" (as in ETH 1.0) in ETH 2.0? After how long a transaction will be considered final (for example exchanges currently consider a transaction being made after 30\~50 blocks, as protection against 51% attacks and double spending). As far as I see while ETH 2.0 will/could bring transaction throughput, I am not sure if it can bring the speed needed for fast transactions (credit card like time). I would really like to know this, leaving out level 2 possible improvements.

8751,"For me, there are two main balancing points. I agree that the difficulty bomb is used as a coercive tool - for a supposedly decentralized network, it's surprising that this is used to make sure people follow the one true path. However, if we have current rate of progress with the difficulty bomb and devs feeling some time pressure, how much slower will it become if it is removed?",19-01-23-13-28,1,0,[deleted],aiuu1w
8752,Do not remove the difficulty bomb!  IMO ethereum is still in beta until serenity.  Taking away the bomb just screams fork.

8755,">... it's surprising that this is used to make sure people follow the one true path.

The difficulty bomb (DB) is to ensure that there is regular opportunity to leave the old path behind and choose a new path. There are no secrets to the DB, it is easy to remove or reset for anyone who wishes to fork. Wisely, users have chosen new forks with a reset DB to ensure evolution over stagnation. The DB only forces new paths, it cannot force users to choose a specific new path as ""the one true path"".

Point 2 is the exact opposite of decentralization.  Naming one person to ""help lead"" something is in fact the epitome of centralization.  No disrespect to Afri, but even if he's plural, adding him to ""help lead"" is not decentralizing. 

Point 3 yay, you are a group, with a single point of contact.   The good news is that it's yet another group with yet another voice at the table.  However, that's actually centralization because it's one voice for N members, rather than N voices joining the table independently.

Agree, and this is what I was getting at when I posted the link to this [essay on structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) the other day.

No of course not, no one is saying that.

The reason it's decentralized is the exact reason ""ethereum classic"" exists. If anyone else wants to take over and start running their own fork of ethereum there is nothing stopping them. Those scary people in your YouTube steam have no power whatsoever over ethereum classic, they can't prevent it, they can't tell them what to do or force miners not to use it.

9185,"Bitcoin core != Bitcoin. It’s just a client that follows the same consensus rules as everyone else, and doesn’t regularly impose hard forks upon the community, because they don’t have that power to begin with. 

Whereas Ethereum is so centrally controlled that people willingly accept a self-destruct mechanism that forces hard forks, thus forcing people to fall in rank behind strong centralized leadership else the entire system implodes upon itself. Ethereum developers have a gun to the Ethereum community’s head, so calling it consensus is a little precious. 

Heated debates about changes to core do not change fundamental characteristics of the system such as issuance rate, block size, etc. Whereas every ETH hard fork is packed with changes that completely disrupt huge swathes of the ecosystem, to follow a vision laid out by founders that still have near total control over the system. Whereas no one even knows for sure who created Bitcoin - but it doesn’t matter, because even if Satoshi did pop back up, he wouldn’t have the power to change anything. 

They’re not even in the same league. Ethereum is arguably less centrally controlled than most shitcoins, but it is not even close to as truly decentralized as Bitcoin. One could argue that the diluted centralization of Ethereum allows for some evolution of the protocol and is an improvement over the completely ossified BTC protocol, but don’t tell me it’s as decentralized as BTC with a straight face.

Ultimately its developers control what Bitcoin is to some 95 percent or more of its users ([https://coin.dance/nodes/share](https://coin.dance/nodes/share)). I think you're right about their approach to upgrades, though. (Am I right in thinking that Bitcoin Core is backward compatible, back to 0.12? Ethereum is < half its age and you can't say the same.) Still, I don't think those decisions have anything to do with ""centralization"" or ""decentralization."" There's no useful rubric for those terms. It's more accurate and useful to say Bitcoin and Ethereum are centralized differently. That doesn't mean I think they're equivalent.

They all just follow the same consensus rules and to my knowledge there has been zero consensus rules breaking hard forks in the entire history of bitcoin. I mean there’s a long history of people trying, but also a long history of all of those attempts failing. 

It’s really not accurate to say BTC and ETH are centralized differently. There really is a quantitative difference in how they’re decentralized. Who’s the leader of Bitcoin? Of BTC core? You can’t actually answer those questions. In fact people that would have been considered leaders (Gavin Andressen, Roger Ver, Hal Finney, Satoshi) are all either dead or have been rejected and lost their positions of leadership for trying to change things. Whereas Vitalik and friends realistically still control the future of ETH - they call for hard forks and people follow, they decide the issuance regardless of what the community “votes” for, and when they say stop the hard fork, everyone stops. 

In other words, when a group of the most powerful and influential people get into a room and make an agreement to change BTC, they fail every time, because not even a group of the most powerful people has that power (segwit 2x). When they do it with ETH, they succeed, every time. 

There is a fundamental difference between status quo will reign forever unless everyone agrees to change, which will probably never happen (BTC) and status quo is going to break down in a month unless everyone changes, which forces consensus to follow the path of least resistance of the founding fathers or else everyone loses everything (ETH).

I was thinking, even though hiding the paymentID in the amount requested would work, when there are 2 concurrent transactions at the same time to an address, the plugin would not know which transaction to confirm and which one to reject based on the difference between transacted amount - order value in eth = PaymentID method but we might very well make it look at all transactions from the current block onwards and make it do the subtraction across all payments to the address to confirm the transaction. Will try this!

I will explore more into the opcode one though...this is the first time i've come across Constantinople and will check it out. The reason i did not want a normal transaction is that, ethereum does not support UTXO and without a forwarding contract or embeding the paymentID, generating one address per order will cause a hassle when the seller tries to withdraw.

voter apathy is a big problem.   compounded with knowing that a few very wealthy eth holders could sway the vote, and that some of the wealthiest holders are the miners themselves.  

its pretty clear in any discussion of switching out PoW algos that the group that have the most to lose are the stakeholders in the asic mining business.  those that mine with asics.  those that design & build asics.  those that make the software or systems to support them.   you will only hear self serving arguments from the groups who stand the most to lose by any change in the status quo.

miners are for sure a stakeholder and should have a say, but the whole point of switching from one PoW algo to another is to dilute power & influence from the miners to keep them honest and make sure none have a monopoly or exert too much influence...

.. because you know damn well when it comes time to fork to Serenity, that the miners who cant retarget their hardware to mine another coin, wont come quietly and will almost certainly try to keep mining the old fork because their asics serve no purpose except to mine eth, and without ethash their asics are worthless.   or switch to eth classic, which is just as worthless.

As you said, there's a bit of a risk there that some people will abuse it, but this is the internet so that risk is always there. Implementing voting systems in crypto is tricky though, because it's trivially easy to create new accounts with no way of knowing who is who. You can have a whitelist, but that's not really self-governed which defeats the purpose of putting it on the blockchain, and the only other way is to weight votes by how many contributions you've made, or how much Ether you pay, and neither of them necessarily correlate to people who don't want to abuse the system, or try to control it.

Maybe down the road we can have options on an ERC-721 that are shares of ownership in a highrise building somewhere largely populated.

But, for a hard fork, I don't see how you'd lose anything - you'd have two copies, or there could be two chains one with your item and one without. The regulatory agency who has decided to use these, would probably lay out a means for supporting whichever chain the asset was on, or using historical snapshots and re-distributing, etc, etc. 

What did you see happening with a hard fork? I am simply guessing about the information above, since its hard to know what would happen in a hypothetical case like this, but I would be really interested in hearing what you expect to happen during a hardfork with regulated 721s? 

As for the 721s not having enough room for legal compliance, that I don't believe is true. Its a standard, and any project can add extra features while maintaining the ERC-721 standard.

In just half a year, EOS managed to pulverize all other networks in terms of transactions per second and network activity. How much can they achieve in 4 x that time frame?

9399,"""At the expenses of everything else"" seems a little harsh... I am in no way being a fan-boy regarding this, but it seems like EOS had the great opportunity of learning from the faults of other projects, primarily Ethereum. And there are obvious pitfalls to the approach of Ethereum and many other chains. Being a software developer myself, the primary concern that comes to mind is the difficulty at which serious bugs can be effectually patched at pace with the uncovering of the fault. It is extraordinarily tedious to upgrade the software and thus fix the bugs that show up in Bitcoin and Ethereum and many other chains, at least if the bugs lie deep enough, compared to what EOS have apparently accomplished. I know not whether or not we can attribute some of the ease to their different consensus algorithm, but I know that from the very get-go software upgrades where taken closely into consideration. The upgrades that are coming to Ethereum (still just empty promises!) will require forking the blockchain and we've all seen what chaos erupts in the case of Bitcoin and its many forks. We've seen the confusion that splits otherwise healthy communities and actually damages the project. With EOS, they don't have to fork the chain... I cannot go in depth with why this is, but all I know is that this is potentially huge if you look at this from an evolutionary perspective. Consider that pace at which they can roll out updates... We could compare different blockchain projects and see them as different species fighting in an evolutionary arms race. Now, if EOS is the sole project out that that is capable of rapid generational shifts in structural design... that means they can grow at an exponential pace, whilst all other projects are stuck in a linear modus operandi.

From an evolutionary perspective what will make the difference will be having the best technology. I doubt that is what EOS care about... on its main goal EOS has already delivered (grabbing cash).

I guess whether or not EOS is actually less decentralized is still up for debate. Sure, there are more nodes in Eth and Bitcoin... That is, I don't know the exact numbers, so if you do, please update me. In EOS they have block producers that are not only timeshifted, but also elected and in constant competition with other BPs as to who can provide the most stable network, dApps, resources, community involvement etc.   


&#x200B;

The people running Bitcoin and Ethereum are merely in control because they have a ton of resources, but do they have a lot of community trust? What happens when one PoW farm becomes corrupt? You cannot easily vote out the assailant. On EOS, you can. So there's that as a major point on the overall blockchain security.

&#x200B;

If the main goal of the original EOS team -> [Block.One](https://Block.One) was to simply money grab... why have they already given away 1 Billion $ of the 4 they ""moneygrabbed"" solely for furthering dApp development on the network?

9406,"Ethereum and Bitcoin have a approximately 10,000 (ten thousand) nodes running at any given moment. In EOS there are 21 (twenty one) block producers (you can count the slices in the first pie yourself).  The chart pie you posted is not particularly relevant IMHO at the very least (others might say is outright misleading) as it compares block producers (21) and mining pools that indeed aggregate thousands of nodes. So again, it is comparing apples with oranges. If a pool misbehaves, miners can point their miners elsewhere.

In its short life, EOS has already had a couple of instances of censorship and collusion ([https://news.bitcoin.com/report-censorship-prone-eos-needs-to-re-architect-its-infrastructure/](https://news.bitcoin.com/report-censorship-prone-eos-needs-to-re-architect-its-infrastructure/)) ... these would have been absolutely impossible in a decentralized system. For the record... i am not a big fan of PoW and I look forward to switching to PoS ASAP... so I grant your comment on PoW farms in principle... but dPoS is not a good enough solution. 

Regarding you query on whether or not miners have community's trust... I do not mean to sound arrogant but seems to me you should refresh a bit the material from decentralization 101: **the whole point of a blockchain system is that you do not need to have trust in them:** the system works equally well with 100% scumbags or 100% white hats. This is the real genius of Satoshi. 

As per the transistor revolution... the relevance is that no technological revolution has ever been delivered over a few years but rather over decades. Ethereum is no exception: it is not ""running late"" because it is still clunky 3 years after its birth. Query... if all these brilliant open source Ethereum killers out there have have so many cutting-edge technological solutions that solve all these problems... why we cannot just take their solutions and recycle them for Ethereum??? 

As a rule of thumb, I am suspicious of any project portraying itself as the final solution to all the problems plaguing other projects (EOS, Tron, ...) and I have the uttermost respect for those teams working hard heads down over delivering technology. IMHO, all these ""Ethereum's killers"" spend a bit too much time talking about Ethereum and bragging about themselves. Usually the people that end up changing the world are rather humble, concrete and sober. They focus on themselves, not the competition.

9407,"Finally a person whom I can have a decent debate with ;)

I absolutely agree on the whole decentralization 101 thing. I was early in Bitcoin and still live and breathe that mentality, however, I find room for EOS as an ecosystem of dApps, still. The best current analogy I can come up with is that of a new Internet, with websites having the built-in or underlying framework allowing for crypto currencies. Funny thing, the original creators of the web actually wanted this, but it wasn't feasible for them. This is why many of the aging computer legends absolutely love Blockchain. 

If we go by the analogy of EOS being a new Internet, these BPs are perhaps something along the lines of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)... They make up the backbone infrastructure... but it's more in depth than that. There's also side chains and sister chains... In a way... these can both attach to and detach from the ""new Internet"" in a way that's way more fluid than the traditional Internet. The BPs can be voted out. Sure, there's seemingly not that many of them in ongoing use (21, the 21st being randomly swapped), but there's a line of hundreds of Block Producer Candidates (BPCs) standing in line, competing with the 21 active BPs. This market incentive helps keep the BPs sharp and honest (or so we hope !).  


**A little history:**

*""The first Internet backbone was named NSFNET. It was funded by the U.S.  government and introduced by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in  1987. It was a T1 line that consisted of approximately 170 smaller networks operated at 1.544 Mbps. The backbone was a combination of  fiber-optic trunk lines, each of which had several fiber-optic cables  wired together to increase capacity.""* \[[Source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20115/internet-backbone)\]

EOS has more ""smaller networks"" than the original Internet had and it's still only half a year old. I think decentralization is the end-goal... the ideal for which we strive. But we cannot get that optimal setup from day one. In all likelihood, we'll keep pushing the definition and decentralization will keep being an *ideal* or somewhat of a Utopian dream. We need ""good-enough"" ... not perfection. We need a system that scales and EOS seems to be doing so fairly well.

I don't think we can make a direct analogy between EOS and the Internet... but it can perhaps guide some of the thought process. The Mainnet has been up and running for basically half a year. On top of that we have dApps. EOS allows for dApps that are by no means possible on Ethereum. I grant you, that if the devs actually come up with something in terms of scalability, this might change, but for now EOS is simply superior in some respects. 0.5 second block times? That allows for an almost real-time experience needed for games.  


There's been an influx of less tech savvy people in probably every single blockchain related subreddit. (just /r/CryptoCurrency being a complete shitstorm) and that makes it harder to avoid the hype and to actually navigate one's way to the decent discussions. I think that by placing EOS in the group of ""Ethereum Killers"" you engage with a confirmation bias and end up narrow-minded. Without a doubt, Dan Larimer and Vitalik Buterin have been going at it on Twitter, but they do respect each other. I know Dan is merely interested in moving this space forward and actually addressing certain problems he sees in Ethereum. He did that even with Steem. Steemit is a dApp that still isn't technically feasible on Ethereum. Sure, Dan may have been looking into compromises... I'd say he's contributed more to this space than most... He's a visionary.

The fork is still expected to be non-contentious though, as there is no opposition to the new features provided. Technically there are always new coins when a hard-fork occurs as it splits the chain into two, leaving you with all of your ethereum on both chains. In a non-contentious fork however, this second chain is never actually mined past a few blocks because all miners and nodes update their clients to the new chain.",19-01-19-02-00,14,4351,openforbusiness69,ahb93v

9462,"In blockchain technology ""hard fork"" and ""soft fork"" are two specifically defined terms.

Soft forks disallow something that used to be valid. All post-fork blocks are valid under the old rules, but some pre-fork blocks would not be valid under the new rules. This means people running outdated clients can still run on the new chain without any issues. If an outdated client generates a block after the fork it will be rejected by newer clients, and if hashing power on the fork is significant enough that block will become orphaned, and older clients will move onto the chain that has more hashing power, ignoring blocks they would still consider to be valid simply because they aren't part of the hardest chain.

Hard fork allow things that weren't valid before. As soon as you have a block that does something that didn't used to be allowed, old clients will reject that block and anything that comes after it. If there are enough old clients still mining, they can go off and create their own chain. This is a chain-split, like you get with Ethereum Classic, BCH, etc.

If a significant majority of miners follow a hard-fork, you won't get a chain split, but it's still a hard fork because of the nature of the change to the block validation rules. Ethereum has had several hard forks to date, and only one of them resulted in a chain split.",19-01-19-02-00,3,2774,AusIV,ahb93v

9491,"Thanks u/CraftyVegetable for your post.  While I don't think this conservatism is going to be the downfall, I agree that not driving to a goal is the hardest thing I have seen in the Core Dev calls since I started following every call since August.  Goals are meant to be lofty and attained by hard work, not by what is sufficient or adequate.  Many of these delays and public speak show very little drive to produce or complete and move on (less on research and 2.0 then on completing Constantinople).   And while I can see how they are so proud of themselves to be able to stop an upgrade, imagine if they used some of that hustle to get this upgrade completed?!  

Now I can see why many devs don't like the core dev call because they can't be themselves and are being critiqued publically in every semantic word choice and debate they choose to have on the call.  I also understand how they bend over backwards to have many voices heard, but decentralization does not mean you can't have the leadership to complete tasks and move onto the next thing.  

I hope core devs can find a way to communicate both passion and perspective in public meetings, but also where there is a mode of change in mentality to ""Let's get this done,"" or ""We need to step it up!""

No, they don't. A security flaw got pointed out and the devs facilitated a way to proceed, naturally the network was on board with not forking with a security issue. The consensus wasn't central, just the fix. The acceptance in the fix still required the networks consensus which wouldn't've been achieved if the devs hadn't done a good job and that would have resulted in a contentious fork.

There are 4 issues getting conflated here, none of them a big deal:

1. Drinking games (and frequent references to how much one has drunk and how drunk one feels) on the stream.

Purpose is an object that lets you store information about the purpose of this imagewallet. For example which keys of which networks to derive and how many but also information about how the imagewallet should be rendered etc.

Another purpose could be to derive all keys of all blockchains connected to a multichain framework - such as [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

These statements are false. EIP-1283 was added to the Constantinople Meta-eip on September 19th, 2018. See [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/f32661d199793356b0c24efad2bdbab68678e2e6#diff-c18451894b5de35b7eef456b57495199) for the commit.

>Stop assuming Solidity send() is safe from reentrancy. It’s not. A low level CALL without value transfer can call back passing a little less than 2300 gas. Always use a logic lock to protect from reentrancy.

The issue is that people haven't been worried about reentrancy. They've been worried about state modification due to reentrancy, which was previously impossible with 2300 gas. I agree that using a logic lock is best, but that was very expensive pre-Constantinople. Now relying on reentrancy not causing state modification is too wide-spread to just ""recommend to not do it"". The author seems to both put all the blame on smart contract devs for making false assumptions, but also on the core devs for not catering to those false assumptions. Can't put all the blame on both.

If you download a copy of the file you must upload a whole copy of the file. If you do the math then if someone seeds to 2.3 (downloaded once and sent over two copies) then it's impossible for everyone to have a 1.0 ratio. There are people who have dedicated seedboxes that seed everything forever which makes it hard to follow the rules even if you want to.

Now that money is involved you can bet you won't get any for using this. In fact this is essentially a service where you pay for files since you need the token to download in the first place.

By that definition, Bitcoin Core cannot be a full node, because Bitcoin Core does not keep an index of all addresses, nor a map of txid->transaction associations. In order to run a full node, according to your definition, you need to run something like [Bitpay Insight](https://github.com/bitpay/insight), because Insight's copy of the dataset is more complete than Bitcoin Core's.

But you might say, ""Bitcoin Core's copy of the blockchain *is* complete! It has every transaction and block ever! The only thing that Bitpay Insight has that Core does not have is multiple *views* of the same dataset!"" To which I respond: That's *exactly what the historical states are*. If you don't keep a stored copy all of the historical states on Ethereum, but you do keep a copy of all of the blocks, you can recompute any state you want, although not quickly. If you don't keep an indexed copy of all of the transactions in Bitcoin, but you want to look up a specific address, you can find every transaction you want by re-reading the whole blockchain and scanning for those transaction, but you can't do that quickly.

These upgrades generally are non-contentious, client developers release versions that are set to move over to the new fork chain and ignore the old one. Those who run their own clients or nodes deploy these versions. In your case whoever is running the exchange will be doing that. When the time comes the old chain silently becomes irrelevant and everything continues on the new chain.

It is highly unlikely anyone will attribute value to the old chain now that everyone is in near-unanimous agreement that it is not the chain with value any more. The confusion comes from the fact that not all hard forks come about as the result of deploying a near universally popular update. Some hard forks are the result of a disagreement about how something should work. These are the ones that will result in a token split e.g. in the case of ETC.

* Our team has grown to 13 full-time members. Will continue to grow in 2019.
* We participated in a number of cool events in 2018 like the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/) alongside legends like [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) and [Whitfield Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie)
* We had our first team retreat in the Swiss Alps where we came up with cool ideas like the Hyperdata Project
* [Hyperdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdata) are data objects linked to other data objects in other places, as hypertext indicates text linked to other text in other places. This goes beyond just creating a “social network” and points towards a “social network of networks”. 
* This initiative builds on the idea of a storage agnostic data model and schema for linking data across different domains and platforms. For example, this means that a piece of data hosted on the Web 2.0 could link to another one hosted on IPFS, which in turn could potentially link to data hosted even on your local file system.
* We will test the Hyperdata idea in the AKASHA.world dapp, with comments being the first area that will benefit from this new approach.

Thank you for the wonderful questions and for giving me a chance to nerd-out! 🙂 

Although the term ""Collective Mind"" is quite obscure, the term ""[Collective Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence)"" is more well known. 

According to Wikipedia, ""Collective intelligence (CI) is shared or **group intelligence** that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals (...)"". Following this line of thought, you can also imagine a **group mind** at the “source” of this shared intelligence.

My theory is that similar to how we have various incentives encountered in nature that gently push us towards one thing or another (i.e. pleasure as an incentive to increase the chances of species reproduction) we are hardwired to “long” for connection with one another. This can also be seen as “normal” because we are a social species, however I tend to believe there’s something more to it - especially when you look at our recent past as a civilization becoming increasingly interconnected.

Interestingly enough, Oxytocin (the hormone associated most commonly with “love”) [seems to be involved also in the socialization between individuals when coming together as a group](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20101114/oxytocin-more-than-mere-love-hormone#1). This makes me suspect that in our uniqueness and individuality we are perfectly designed (and incentivized) as connective minds to give birth to this emergent intelligence. Also, I believe that we are *already* doing this but without realizing it. 

Going back to our purpose, I believe that if we can improve the way in which we communicate (lower the noise, reduce fakenews efficiency, etc) and enhance the way in which we organize and collaborate at various scales we can begin understanding and gradually optimizing this naturally occurring phenomenon. It’s worth mentioning also that I do not see this as “one collective mind” but rather as a fractal of sorts with collective minds of all sizes, sometimes overlapping. 

When we look at the “Information Society” we live in today, we can see that we’ve made big progress when it comes to the way we **technologically** process information. However, when it comes to how we **socially** process information there is a lot to be done until we can get to the same level of sophistication. There are a few emergent fields like [Social Cognition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition) and [Social Computing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_computing) that are touching this area, but I still feel that we have a long way to go - and THAT IS EXCITING!

When we frame this in the context of AKASHA, we want to build something that takes in consideration also the human in the human-computer-human interaction. Even though “technology” is at the forefront of our project and we are talking about this on a tech-oriented subreddit, we are basically interacting through a socio-technical system with Karma, points, etc that was thought decades ago (most likely in an attempt to “[exploit human vulnerability](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology)”).

With AKASHA, we start from a different perspective and with a desire to enhance our collective intelligence rather than manipulating it or dumbing it down. Yes, you can access your individual mind, but if we can come up with ways in which we can visualize the flows and interactions at collective level maybe we can understand just enough to make us slightly smarter as individuals - and in the process leveling up also the intelligence of the collectives you are part of. If we can somehow establish this positive feedback loop, I think we’ll see many cool things emerging from this.

You can't. Your individual mind cannot fathom a collective mind.

>As far as I can tell, I am limited to accessing an individual mind.

Yes, we cannot be aware of a collective mind. You can see it as the tip of the fingers on a hand. We can interact with other fingers and we think we are separate. But actually we are 'one' because we are connected by the same hand.

>Also: where is my mind?

Define mind. And define what you consider as 'me' or 'I'. The way I used 'mind' in this context is pure consciousness, that what I really am.

I find it easy to comprehend the idea of a collective intelligence. This brings to mind ant farms and distributed computer systems.

I find it harder to grasp the idea of a collective mind. That could just be to do with how we define things. I consider a true mind to have sentience & consciousness. The idea of their being a collective mind thus brings about the idea of collective sentience / consciousness.

If there is a collective consciousness (a source consciousness) from which we all came, then any system built on earth which takes advantage of an individuals desire to *return to source* and *be at one with all*, would be a system that is exploiting that natural desire, to draw the individual towards a *false* collective consciousness. IE an artificial, collective consciousness which is imitating a hypothetical real one.

When you consider that many people, have a huge urge to control and dominate others, the idea that a false collective consciousness could be built on Earth brings to my mind the image of a system which is a bit like The Matrix.

People are already experimenting with VR, neural-interfaces, bio-interface systems (systems which connect to parts of your body) and multi-user virtual environments.

Furthermore, people already seem to have a propensity for giving up individual liberties, for using proprietary software and hardware which they do not wholly control and for spending lots of times on computers.

It may be that I haven't understood the goals of your organisation correctly. However, if I have, might I suggest that you put at least as much funding into programs that awaken people, point them towards wisdom and enlighten them as you put funding into technology oriented programs.

Collective intelligence (CI) is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in consensus decision making. The term appears in sociobiology, political science and in context of mass peer review and crowdsourcing applications. It may involve consensus, social capital and formalisms such as voting systems, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity.  Collective IQ is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence.

**Social cognition**

Social cognition is ""a sub-topic of social psychology that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that cognitive processes play in social interactions.""More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with conspecifics (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of social psychology, social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of cognitive psychology and information processing theory. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.

**Social computing**

Social computing is an area of computer science that is concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems. It is based on creating or recreating social conventions and social contexts through the use of software and technology. Thus, blogs, email, instant messaging, social network services, wikis, social bookmarking and other instances of what is often called social software illustrate ideas from social computing.

Hmm. Well, first of all, I think we should clarify about what part of our ""humanness"" are we talking about - the ""social animal"", the ""sentient/empathic individual"", the ""spiritual being"", or something else?

> If there is a collective consciousness (a source consciousness) from which we all came, then any system built on earth which takes advantage of an individuals desire to return to source and be at one with all, would be a system that is exploiting that natural desire, to draw the individual towards a false collective consciousness. IE an artificial, collective consciousness which is imitating a hypothetical real one.

If we would turn your argument on its head - any system built on earth that thrives by dividing the individuals is somehow better because it does not draw the individual toward a ""false"" collective consciousness?

If we take the Matrix example (social animal/sentient individual perspective), we are actually talking about an **Artificial** Intelligence (AI) that reached a level where it needed humans as bio-batteries to power itself due to the absence of sunlight. In my example, I imagine more of a **Collective** Intelligence"" (CI) scenario where humans are more than just mere passive bio-battery cultures but rather active participants and co-creators of our world reality. 

Following along the idea of CI vs AI, we are now faced with a number of big challenges as a species. 

In the AI scenario, it comes down to having this superior-synthetic-intelligence either offering inputs to a human operator for a decision or implementing those decisions itself assuming the final stage of optimization would be the removal of the human element in the system (the weakest link). And maybe somehow, this AI would secure the future of our species, would solve all our biggest challenges and hopefully not build terminators in the process.

In the CI scenario, I see it rather as humans being invaluable because they would generate the inputs in the system through various signals, conversations and decisions - which in turn would generate insights at the collective level. Moreover, assuming the interfaces (software+hardware) used to interact with the CI mesh are open source, the signal generation, transmission and the medium in which they are interpreted should be more trustworthy than a black box AI run by (or running) a corporation. 

I think most of the Web 2.0 apps have focused on *replacing* the physical interactions with digital interactions. I tend to believe that the Web 3.0 will open new ways of interaction that will *enhance* rather than replace our physical interactions. My next post (Metamorphosis Part II) will touch more on this topic.

So, coming back to the initial idea and ""false"" collective consciousness - I believe that we should play to our strengths as humans and if one of our core traits embedded in our DNA is to organize and collaborate in groups (and manifest CI) - we should take a closer look at organizing and collaborating.

If anything, it should bring us closer to each other and our ""true"" nature as ""social animals"", ""empathic individuals"" and ""spiritual beings"" rather than push us towards something false. If we look around today, there are plenty of systems thriving by keeping us apart, divided and fixated our differences - and have been for thousand of years.

Stablecoins are one of many useful applications of blockchains, and since blockchains are permissionless (or at least any blockchain worth paying attention to here are permissionless) there's no way to *stop* them from existing. If you don't like them don't use them.

That said, not all stablecoins are created equal. I'm much more interested in something like DAI, which uses clever game theory to maintain its peg, than something like Tether which is a more traditional ""just trust us"" sort of thing. Slightly better than old-school fiat in that it's more easily transactable online, but I certainly wouldn't hold any significant amount of it for longer than I had to.",19-01-17-02-22,4,2238,FaceDeer,agm5si
9802,"I'm sorry but I can't support anything for any Stablecoin, as the entire science behind the stablecoin is to go against the very principles of decentralization.  
  
Coins such as the tether, a stablecoin, has proven that such coins are prime for negative players to do negative things with the money. for a coin to intentionally manipulate the volatility of a coin says that it itself isn't decentralized, nor can it ever really grow to be a usable coin in the grand scheme of things. some other disagreements with your write up,  
  
> Cryptocurrency is still a technical, niche and lousy payment system  
 
I disagree. yes, it is technical but technically speaking one simply needs a lite wallet (I will always promote full nodes over everything but the lite wallet is used for argument sake), an account at coinbase and they can buy and sell crypto. in fact, they don't even need a lite wallet, they can buy and sell back to coinbase (not suggested but it's doable). I disagree with this being a ""niche"" system. the system itself, Blockchain is ffffaaarrr from niche. and to label it as such says to me (I can't speak for others) that you're not at all as informed on the technology as you're letting on (???, In all humbleness). and you saying it's a lousy payment system, lol I'm going to just sit back on that statement.  
  
> Unfortunately the answer to this question is probably yes. I say unfortunately because this indicates that cryptocurrency as a useful consumer tool is still where the Internet was in the early 1990s more or less.  
  
but how? Do you care how a Car, Plane, City Water treatment plant, etc. work? if you aren't a mechanic, a aero-engineer or a city planner then what would motivate you to learn how the system works? just as with fiat money, majority of us aren't aware of how the Feds work, or the reserve. yet, we spend a dollar because it serves a function - to pay debt or receive payment. but just because we don't know how the fiat system works, that doesn't mean anything against the importance of the system or it's popularity.  
  
> What makes a cryptocurrency network valuable is its ability to provide people with payments that are censorship resistant and irreversible and not subject to payment friction imposed by governments or other authorities.  
  
I disagree. the valuation of a coin is not due only to it's censorship resistance, or it's double-spending protection. the censorship resistance was never a main focus as it's easy to censor a coin, you restrict internet outside access to the miners as has been seen recently when I believe China or another Asian nation shut down 5-15 farms. so censorship is very much a reality and possibility. but I do agree with the double-spend protection, as this is one of the main tenants for the use of crypto over other digital payment systems prior to it's creation.  
  
> Ethereum is an awful payment system because of price volatility  
  
if that's the case, then **all** crypto is an awful payment system because of price volatility. and I'm assuming that's what you're subtly hinting at rather it being consciously or unconsciously. but this is an insane claim based on price fluctuation/volatility. I think you (at this point in your article I've read up to) believe crypto is supposed to have stablecoins and this is the **only** way for crypto to work in the real world. but I think you are also subtly promoting the centralization of this technology and financial system as with true decentralization, a coin will always fluctuate and have volatility, working with centralized coins and tech is against the very principle of the technology. and you using the long download time image is just poor click bait. you're downloading years of ledger work. you can't just download it in the blink of an eye.  
  
> I’m very likely the first person to tell you that the price of a cryptocurrency has absolutely nothing to do with its value.  
  
Incorrect. the value of the chain is always on the functionality and features present on the chain. for example, types of consensus would dictate who can and can't mine the chain. so a coin which is CPU minable may be seen as less valuable than specialized equipment mined coins (or visa versa). but not everyone* thinks a coin has value based on it's price. it's like Gold, gold isn't valuable because it's pretty - it's valuable due to the application of the metal as well as the wide range of industries and fields this material can be used in.

Or, the monitoring of prices of coins can be akin to monitoring the prices of stock. nothing nerdy about see when to buy or when to sell, in fact it's absolutely mad to not check the prices if you're considering yourself an investor (no matter how knowledgeable or big of an investor). to claim price watching will be equivalent to nerds learning to how optimize a communication protocol is a hell of a stretch.  
  
> Without a price the miners have no incentive to maintain the integrity of the network.  
  
Not true, and this is proven by ICOs as well as the inception and baby stages of any coin launched. regardless of how big it is or isn't, the miners don't have a price for the new coin they're mining, they **Hope** the coin will spike in valuation. which is why new chains are able to launch. people hope that by getting in on a coin with low valuation and hashing requirements, they can mine enough coin that once the coin breaks a certain value point, they can cash out. what was the suggested future worth or valuation of Bitcoin when Satoshi first started? it wasn't no where near what it is today. when ETH first started, sure there were price speculation talks but no where did the devs say ""Our coin is going to be worth X amount in x years!"". so I think you confuse hope and prospect with something else. no miner is given a guaranteed price on a new blockchain, and if they are then more than likely it's due to price manipulation.  
  
> Unfortunately, open markets for cryptocurrency have resulted in speculation. Speculation has lead to extreme price volatility.  
  
I disagree on the grounds your tone makes it appear that on speculation alone - this has caused price volatility. I think you are removing and even falsely nullifying important factors such as, network attacks, forkings, local and national laws, whale influence, etc. etc. it's very easy to claim speculation alone causes volatility but as an individual who although no where near a guru, but observant and have watched new coins launch and old coins fail, I really feel you're missing the forest for the trees by claiming speculation being thee main cause of volatility. perfect example, this recent 51% attack on ETC saw price drop. it's volatility had nothing to do with speculation and everything to do with chain security.  
  
> If it was possible to restrict the buying of cryptocurrency to only those users who were utilizing it to make payments this might limit price volatility.  
  
what in the actual F, that's centralization in and of itself. I won't even need to further my disagreement with that statement. lol, but I 1000% disagree. question, if this were to happen - what's to stop say me and 10 other like minded individuals with deep enough pockets to rule and control the coin? volatility will be way more possible and likely given the closed-off-nature you propose.

Consumers want different options.  There probably needs to be as many different payment options as there are types of consumers.  Every single different payment mechanism has its upsides and its downsides.  Rather than mandate that everyone **bow down and submit themselves to the one true payment system** I'd like to have different payment systems for different use cases.

I'd also like to have different payment systems for different classes of people.  Stablecoins are not for you.  I don't think it would be fair if I forced you to make payments with stablecoins if you really don't want to do that.
