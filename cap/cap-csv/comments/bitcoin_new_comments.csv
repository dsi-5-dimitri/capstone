133,"He only sold ‘high’ in retrospect. Selling at $14k when it had come down from $19k was not necessarily selling ‘high’. Only if you knew it would still go down. Many people thought they sold ‘high’ in Sept 2017 when they sold at $2800 after it came down from $4k or so. Also a TON of people sold ‘high’ at $1,250–see that idiot Vinny Lingham who boasted about how smart he was for selling all his BTC at that price. He looked like a genius after BTC dropped to $800—but just for a while. 

My point is that these things are not easy to see at the time. If he buys now and later we find out this is the low, then he would have bought ‘low’. If he buys now and the price drops to $1,000 then he would have still bought ‘high’. You just don’t know at the time—only in retrospect. ",19-02-23-19-10,1,1364,bjman22,att5nx

Following your logic he shouldn't buy at 1k as it could go to 300. Meaning he would not have bought low in your eyes. I agree it's relative.  4k is low relative to where he sold and relative to where btc will be by the halving if/when it follows the exact same pattern it has several times already. Which up to this day it's doing perfectly.

Yeah he could potentially lose some additional profit by not waiting for a further drop, but he could also lose if 3500 was the bottom,  if he doesn't buy in now and the price keeps climbing.

For me it's enough profit already to just get in now and not having to follow price 24/7 and worry about trying to time the market perfectly.

1.

2. Agreed, mobile phones are 100x more convenient if we lived in a world where crypto is accepted anywhere and you could just whip your phone out and pay.

Luke D finds bug, we call the chain split bug. This creates a fork, yes?

What does Luke say? ""Tell Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, and Me + Pals in PRIVATE - do NOT tell others, or you are a TRAITOR!""

Why? - Be real here - Because the *financial* history of BTC matters. I call this ""rewind attack"", which is anytime BTC is exchanged for Goods. If I move BTC to BTC between myself, ""rewind"" hardly matters.

Thus you have a form of 'centralization', same as hub-spoke on Lightning. Coinbase, Binance, Gemini dominate the **financial** transferences of coins - Same as Bitcoin Gold, BTC is vulnerable to a Rewind - and a 4 hour rewind costs maybe $1.8 Mil. It is certainly possible to create profit via shorts + fraud with a cost of *only* $1.8 Mil.

But this is not possible with Check Point, period, no matter the funds. It is physically impossible. And it is NOT a hard fork OR a soft fork, it is ONLY a wallet implementation. It's an absolutely great idea (but sure, I'm biased, wrote a paper about it 9 months ago, etc).

I think that is probably worth stressing again, it is a WALLET implementation, NOT a protocol change. I think if you thought more you'd change your mind... or if BTC experiences a significant Rewind attack in the future, I think you'll see that the *cost* to BTC holders is far, far more damaging then you can possibly imagine. I would wager it to be in excess of several Billion.

What? No. If Luke is malicious, he'll exploit the bug. If he's not malicious, he'll responsibly report it to the developers where it will be fixed and then disclosed to the public.

>Thus you have a form of 'centralization', same as hub-spoke on Lightning

1. Lightning is not hub and spoke design, in fact it is actively designed to make that topology less attractive
2. If you're worried about centralization, a developer dictating block checkpoints is **far worse**.

>It is physically impossible. And it is NOT a hard fork OR a soft fork, it is ONLY a wallet implementation. 

You say that like it's better. That means that different wallets would consider different forks valid. Which means you can trivially cause a chain split. This is on top of the fact that [the checkpoint system itself is insecure](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-cash-abcs-rolling-10-block-checkpoints/) (and a huge centralization flaw).

Dropbit seems to be a custodial service so they keep your Bitcoin in ""safe storage"" just like banks keep your money. You don't really own those Bitcoins while they are in that storage. If you think leaving your money with some company is a good idea, then you probably should stick with ordinary banks and fiat money, because they have all the legal framework, insurance, bailouts etc, that Bitcoin doesn't have. The problem with custodial services is that they can take your money any time they want. Simply by saying it's not really ""yours"" anymore. With Bitcoin it's the first time in the history where we can have really our digital money, really in our hands and under our sole control. But that applies only to non-custodial wallets.

""Optimal LN routing"" will never be solved because most engineers involved aren't even bothered with **defining** what ""Optimal LN routing"" means. The most basic question would be: Optimal with regards to what? Fees? #Hops? Privacy? Speed? Maybe optimal channel balancing along tx routes results in lower fees and hops long-term. LN is constantly changing. Even if a useful abstraction existed it would most likely be obsolete by the time someone defined it.

&#x200B;

Engineers working on LN aren't concerned with routing being optimal. They are concerned with routing just working. That softens the expectations far enough to bring things down to being feasible. No one can tell whether LN will work on a global scale because no one knows what LN will look like at that point.

There has been significant inflation in many asset types.  Consumer prices are determined by consumers who did not benefit from TARP QEs and zero interest rates as much as the ""1%"" did.  Gold is at all time highs in every currency except the USD where it's close.  

Interest rates are still highly accommodating.  And markets went through cardiac arrest raising them to even these low rates.  What do you think real estate and stocks will do at say 8% rather than 2?  Are you aware of what happened with Volcker's 20% rates?  Interest rates matter.  

For now, the USD is imposed by cruise missile.  That can't persist.  Nobody wants that. Governments and big companies will route around the USD banking system. This is already happening.   Once these routes are established, they won't need to hold USD cash in the same amount.  The devaluation of the dollar will happen.

The premise of your assertion is there are **net 10,000 genuine long term believer/builders still valuing bitcoin**, if that holds true, bitcoin will still has its value.

I can see there are a few ways for this scenario to break down

1. Those 10,000 individuals' demand for btc (converting fiat to btc) is tapering off the same rate as the amount of new coins being mined.
2. Assuming there is no net increase of believers/builders, and the buying and selling actions of btc **plus** new coin generated are at an equilibrium, meaning if there are just about \~5,000 individuals buying btc with fiat and the other half selling their btc for fiat.

If there two conditions were to occur, btc price will not increase, but we have to factor in inflation rate of government backed currency (GBC), if GBC inflation rate is much higher, then the fiat value of BTC will be higher on a nominal basis.

750,"This is meant to demonstrate how rare 1 Bitcoin is.

Let me try and explain why it matters for price:

Sellers are simply persons, companies, exchanges etc that invested in Bitcoin earlier and are now cashing out. Some are short term speculators cutting their losses after fomo'ing in at the peak and some are maybe long term holders taking profit. Or maybe a bit of both, you might have a long term holder cashing out because they feel the price is going lower...my point is that this is really all just noise in the long term. Youre either building or youre not.

Then you will have good news, bad news, governments telling you this will be the next reserve currency, or bluffing that they can/intend to outlaw Bitcoin and everything in between influencing speculators. Again, its just noise.

What matters is that say after all the noise there are net 10,000 genuine long term beleivers/builders still buying precious Bitcoin in 2019.
That means that every now and then, they use their fiat to buy a little more Bitcoin.
Even if no more long term builders/buyers join the fray over the next 8 years, the supply of new coins will be 75% less and the net long term demand roughly the same = higher price.
This is the Bitcoin policy that attracts builders (or should i coin the term buidlers).

If history repeats though, we will have a lot more new long term beleivers join Bitcoin once then next wave (after the sellers are exhausted) occurs.

If there is some new technology that enables harder, sounder, more censorship resistant, more inflation resistant, more decentralized money than Bitcoin, then I think it would be incorporated into Bitcoin either by soft fork, hard fork, or, if the technology is simply not compatible with either of these methods, by taking the existing Bitcoin UTXO set and implementing it on the new technology.",19-02-23-10-01,3,209,slepyhed,ato4nl

In any case it would appear net ongoing Bitcoin demand could, put crudely, drop 75% by 8 years time (2x halvings) and maintain a 1:1 inflation adjusted value ratio with the current price.

**Questions for you**

Why would new technology have to replace the internet?

It seems you believe BTC has utilized the internet to its fullest potential?

&#x200B;

**BTC penetration:**

I would argue BTC has market penetration only relative to other cryptocurrencies, it looks like it will remain that way for a while given the tract record and the ""soundness"" of BTC.

If you are talking about BTC as a global currency it is still small.

^(According to this article:) [^(https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/)](https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/)

*As of December 2018 -* 32 Million wallets has been set up, it is possible one individual entity holds multiple wallet, so we can be looking at an even smaller number of real users. 

*Market Cap as of 24 Feb 2019 -* USD 72.87 Billion, it is **0.3%** of the US Economy, 0.15% of the World's TOP 5 Economies (US, China, Japan, Germany, UK)

Biggest problem I have with BTC is its limited use case right now, which really limits the adoption for it to be a true global currency, I am sure many are aware of.

&#x200B;

**Decentralization:**

In order to mine BTC with ASICs, and still remain *cash flow positive*, you would need power cost that is 6.5 US cents or lower at the current price/difficulty. That's excluding other operating expenses, such as utilities, labor and depreciation. Meaning, very few people but the ones that have access to 1.) Lower power cost & 2.) Scale 3.) Access to capital can remain a profitable miner. These conditions makes mining or BTC much more centralized then it once was.

I also read that mining pools makes the mining hash power more centralized within a few entities, *can someone clarify this?*

&#x200B;

**Hash Power:**

Indeed BTC has the greatest hash power behind it right now that is because it is still the most profitable and least risky currency.

Hash power will shift if something better comes long.

Could BTC one day adopt Proof of Stake? Making hash power a non-issue? (this would require a separate thread of discussion)

774,"Hi,

Interesting set of questions, I would be happy to share my thoughts! I’m typing from my phone, so forgive my lack of formatting:

1- my personal opinion, but I think you get only 1 chance with something like bitcoin. We all know it’s history now. It was a project and no one knew it would succeed and it arrived at this point organically. 

Because of this, there is a sense to trust it a bit more.
Every protocol that has come since, there is the specter of financial interests involved and a lack of trust. 

2- market penetration - First movers advantage and also because it was the first and started off as just a project that had no guarantee for success, I believe it will have greater acceptance.

As far as use case goes, security. It has one job to do and that is be a secure decentralized ledger and it is doing that remarkably well. 

Also I’m aware compared to national currencies, bitcoin has near non existent market penetration. I was talking about crypto market penetration.


3- a good amount of hashpower comes from China, they have had first mover advantage here. 

If bitcoin does become the global standard, this will change as even more miners and equipment manufacturers will enter the field and increase research and development. 

Just remember, the first cars were carriages with 3-4 bicycle wheels and a pull break.

4- I don’t see anything better coming along. In my opinion, bitcoin will either fail or become the world standard. I don’t see a middle ground. 

As for proof of stake. It’s tough to say because it hasn’t been proven to bitcoins scale.

Pow is far from being perfect though with the centralization of mining pools and how the block reward, mining costs, difficulty rate all eventually play in to encourage this.

There are 2 MAJOR issues with that strategy:

1. Buying back in would cause the price to rise just as much as selling caused it to drop. Best case scenario you can hope to break even. Small traders can make the highest gains in a volatile market because their smaller orders have a lot less slippage. 

2. Unless all the institutions and whales are colluding (spoiler, they aren’t) then one market manipulator has no guarantee that another whale won’t eat their lunch. Someone who is considering using their massive amount of funds to drop the price of Bitcoin has no idea if there are other whales on the sidelines waiting to snap up cheaper coins.

Except that owning all the Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to keep the price from going up. All it takes is someone with $60 billion to come along and dump it into Bitcoin. In order to keep Bitcoin at the current price during that the manipulator would have to sell their entire stack at the current price, leaving them with nothing.

> It's very hard to wreck someones short who has enough coins to ensure resistance isn't broken.

Yup, but again, there literally isn’t enough Bitcoin in the world to do this. Even if this manipulator owned 100% of the Bitcoin’s they wouldn’t be able to stop someone with $60 billion from pushing the price up.

> With futures it's pretty fucking easy dude. Buy $1M BTC on spot, while longing $1M on futures.
You spent $1M on spot but your futures trade just generated 300% or $1M due to leverage.

This would be essentially robbing the person on the short side of the futures trade. Futures traders are generally pretty sophisticated, they are unliked to allow themselves to be repeatedly gamed in that fashion. Using the proposed scheme every dollar that the manipulator makes comes straight from the person on the other side of the futures trade. It’s just unrealistic to think that futures traders would fall for this repeatedly.

I could imagine another evolution also:

If Bitcoin is accepted by western governments as reserve currency, they could one day decide to impose rules of what they accept as Bitcoin in a next steps years later. E.g. they could define that a certain block hash is hostile (e.g. because of a detected 51% attack or because it contains a TX from a blacklisted ""terrorist"" UTXO), thereby effectively forking/redefining Bitcoin into a ""Bitcoin West"". They could forbid  exchanges etc. to offer services w.r.t. what they consider the ""evil"" chain, and would thereby enforce their Bitcoin block checkpoints (and thereby consensus rules) onto the whole jurisdiction. This way government would gain control over Bitcoin, gradually, and so re-gain control over the national currency eventually.

Clearly, they would do this gradually - ""heating the water that the frog is sitting in"" slowly, and it would be a process spanning over decades, because it has to align with people's psychology. It could be something like that:

1. Government accepts Bitcoin as legal currency.

2. Bitcoin more&more replaces fiat in economical life.

3. One day a hostile 51% attack happens rolling back the blockchain by 1 day.

4. Government insists to ignore this attacker's blockchain via checkpointing. Industry, media and population agree and are happy that government makes clear not to give evil forces any chance. Few warning voices of too much governmental control are ignored by the large population and msm, because government did the right thing here. The warning voices are even discredited as ""terrorists"". All goes back to normal again after this incident.

5. After increase tertorist use, Government passes a law that forbids miners to include blacklisted terrorist UTXOs into blocks and forbids companies to operate with such chains and offer any services - whether exchanges, banks, grocery stores or online shops. Similar to step 4., government publishes lists of UTXOs or block hashes that miners must not accept.

6. Once the system is established, the blacklusting is gradually extended from terrorist scope to economical and political scope.

7. Competing governments do the same. So companies operating world-wide must abide to the blacklists from all those governments - a superset of all blacklists!

8. Needless to say that anonymous untraceable blockchains become widely forbidden.

9. People realize that this money system, which started as a free system, is maybe more fascist than classical fiat has ever been.

10. In a political conflict the chain breaks up in two, as jurisdiction 1 is no more willing to accept the blacklist of jurisdiction 2. Two World-Bitcoins are the result.

11. Since government has anyway the de-facto control over Bitcoin now, they decide to change consensus rules from pow to government-checkpointed blocks. So Bitcoin blockchain finally becomes a centrally controlled fiat coin.

12. As a natural next step, the entity controlling Bitcoin also eliminates the 21 Mill cap, thereby finalising the transition from free Bitcoin to centralized fascist CentralBankCoin 2.0.

Needless to say - I hope this scenario never materializes. But I fear it contains elements that may materialize. Maybe not exactly in this way and order, but likewise, with the intention to regain governmental control over the money eventually.

But that slow gradual takeover is something tested many times in the history, it's basically politics, so big actors like governments, mafia, super rich 0.01%, they already know how to play this game. Sooner or later they will try it on Bitcoin. Because everything essentially is about people. We assume ""the people"" would correctly identify that an attack is actually happening, that might not be true. And a small minority that does may be silenced, put to the side, overpowered by social media bots, etc. Second, we assume that people will switch to the honest chain - what if they don't? What if the changes introduced by the attacker look like normal upgrades, bugfixes, features, each has something good and something bad, in the end people might be reluctant to give up the ""good"" things - the candy, the cat pictures, to avoid the bad things - like selling your privacy to marketers or foreign nations, or in this case giving up our financial sovereignty once again. We have some vivid examples of this happening today on many places.

Believing in a specific direction that the protocol should take is not an evil ideology, and in fact, having the thought that anyone who proposes or supports any unpopular change is evil, is itself an evil ideology. Let supporters of all forks propose ideas and present their arguments. If they're good arguments, they'll win out. If they're bad arguments, they'll lose. There's no need for censorship or radical labeling. The protocol was tested, and the majority went a different direction. I don't agree with the directions BCH, BTG, BSV, etc have all gone, but I'm glad they have. They branch out, provide new ideas, and die out if they aren't good ideas. Meanwhile, it's an ""attack"" on Bitcoin, but one that only ends up strengthening it.

Edit: that all said, I don't support BitPay's decision to go exclusively BIP70, even though I understand their transition to using it (security purposes). I would really prefer they had a button that said ""I accept the risks that this address may not be real and accept the risk"", or work towards developing a BIP that allows your client to do some validation with a screenshot, so that even if your webpage was intercepted, it could verify the address info (that's also backwards compatible so any existing wallet that supports QR code scanning also supports it).",19-02-23-05-42,4,30,ExtraIncrease,atl6qd

They handled $1 billion last year and the error rate they said before turning it on was like 8-9% which would be refunding a $80-90 million dollars worth of invoices. After it was 0.2 percent, or $200k worth of invoices. If the majority of those payments are under $100 that is a fuck ton of support avoided due to preventing user error.

As long as they don't self destruct, it wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea to turn some BTC into BCH, given that it's one of the more well founded coins (along with a couple others), and it raises in ratio faster than BTC typically does. There's nothing stopping you from using alt coins to increase your stake in BTC. In the meantime, all development done provides the crypto community with additional information/knowledge for the future.

This is all politics. They want to burn those fossil fuels so bad and fossil fuels will be burned for as long as they are the cheapest form of energy. But they are not really the cheapest, because the effects on water, air (10,000 deaths per day), and climate change (negative economic growth, famine, refugees) are not included in the price of fossil fuels. The net result is that fossil fuels in Western society are in effect subsidized more than renewables.

The budget for +1.5 'C is already reached. At +1.6 'C the greenland ice sheet will irreversibly melt and lead to a sea level rise of 7.2 meter although melting will take many centuries. We're at 75% of the budget for +2 'C. We'll get to +4 'C if emissions are not decreased with 3.5% each year starting next year. Adaptation beyond +4 'C at this rate of change may be impossible for civilization.

People think of climate change as a nice to have for tree huggers, but it will be a severe blow to the economy. Of course some will come out ahead and those are the ones squeezing every penny out of fossil fuels by misleading the public.

Didn't Peercoin, freicoin(?) one of them try this?

This article presupposes that a lot of HOLDERS of bitcoin would ever want the rules change to water down their holdings. hahah, my sides, NO. No, existing holders do not want their share watered down. Latecomers are just later. They should just be happy that they are younger and have youth. Or if they are old and coming late to the party, well whatever, at least bitcoin isn't discriminating.

A more interesting question is if existing holders of bitcoin would be willing to reduce supply. But I think that integrity comes first to true believers so no, they would not be interested in that self-defeating change either. Showing that you can change bitcoin to upset the balances or make this into a big game of future value hurts the future value, so I expect holders will resist change. Because they do, the ones that also want a predictable and change-resistant and trustworthy money get on board. 

Other latecomers are basically scammers and make up new scamcoins to get people on board. They can dress it up how they like, and add bells and whistles, but with recent changes, as MONEY, bitcoin is quite good. I still believe in a lot of Monero's ideas.

1220,"Andreas seems to place too much emphasis on Bitcoin Maximalism = Single platform or single currency worldwide which I think is absurd. I cannot think of one person who defines Maximalism in such a manner.

Most Maximalists don't tend to suggest altcoins will dissapear, simply that they will become increasingly irrelevant because using them adds friction, costs, slippage, and risk. The reason why many fiat currencies exist is because this inefficiency is deliberately added to give local control to individual states at a cost. Whether it be loyalty points , local currencies, local fiat ... these will continue to exist and compete with BTC as it grows and eventually overtakes the USD as the reserve currency of trade and perhaps one day becomes the most stable unit of account.

Maximalists don't suggest that people should not have choice or be restricted from creating their own coin(remember with UASF many maximalists were going to create and follow a new chain even if it was a minority one.) The recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD) is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs.

Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-

1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist

2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain

3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist at least anytime soon

4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like the USD is at this time). Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment

BTC maximalists tend to believe some altcoins are not scams like grin, ltc, monero, namecoin, and others. This does not mean they want anything to do with these altcoins. Some maximalists use and invest in these , others just want to focus on Bitcoin. There are literally only a few exceptions to this with JWW calling everything a scam but BTC , and some people like Luke calling LTC a scam (but I doubt he considers everything but BTC a scam). Most ""maximalists"" tend to simply want to focus on Bitcoin though and fall under the description I present , not the caricature that Andreas refers to.",19-02-23-02-52,10,2128,bitusher,atj5bk

People with no experience in crypto are trying to gauge intent to determine what to invest in, and this is completely misguided. If you are a crypto investor and you find yourself looking at a coin's founders or dev team to determine their intent, you should just stop and buy bitcoin.

Nope. If Bitcoin fails, then that’s the end of cryptocurrency. Failure proofs that it is impossible to maintain consensus. Bitcoin basically is just a set of consensus rules. If these cannot be agreed on long term and cryptocurrencies just keep coming and going, then the entire concept has failed.

If there's a serious bug in the Bitcoin implementation (for example digital signatures), and Bitcoin's value goes to 0, there's no way people will trust altcoins and put billions of dollars in them. It will probably move cryptocurrencies back by 30 years.

2. Design errors. Can also be solved with consensus although it would take some time and stop gap measures may be required.

3. Cryptographic assumptions no longer being valid. This is dangerous because it requires fast fixes while staying in consensus about what new cryptographic assumptions to take.

Much more impactful and potentially irresolvable would be break of consensus and a split in the developer community creating a competing coin that manages to get the best developers.

This is also unlikely because clearly, that would be the beginning of the end.

The late bronze age showed a lot of empire collapses in the middle east, but certainly not all of them. And it wasnt even a noteworthy period in Chinese history. I think the boundary line is not very significant; its called out as an archeological age mainly because it changes the types of artifacts that an archeologist is likely to find laying around, not because primitive ironworking was a transformational technology. 

If anything, iron was a very slowly developing technology ; it took over a few thousands years for us to master it, and it was not a significant inflection point, imo.

In comparison, the internet and bitcoin will be a much more sudden change - within a human lifetime or two. The internet has already achieved a global transformation of society; I would argue the advent of the world network has been far more profound than that of iron working was. 

Bitcoin has the potential to be something even larger, imo. Its hard to relate what that is like... if you remember clifford stolls famous mocking essay the internet - or the ridiculous nature of startup companies during the first internet bubble, the problem was that people werent really ready to understand the impact even if you could clearly describe it to them, and even if they were technologically astute.

Even if you were knee deep in network technology at the time, you might not have predicted that the internet would become so all-consuming that people would carry around a computer/video camera/tracking device/VCR/walkman/calculator/etc/etc all day every where they went, and essentially ignore people in public places in favor of communicating over the ever-present internet instead. You might not have predicted that the average person would document their private lives in hideous detail for all to see, while porn became free as people desperate competed to show amateur porn in exchange for nothing. You might not have predicted the slow death of the shopping mall and retail outlet, in favor of all mail-order all the time.

You might have predicted ""virtual reality"", ""3d hologram TV"", or ""automated highways"" or hundred of things which never came about.

Bitcoin is at that point now; its going to change society in ways that even the most clued in people cannot foresee. Things we have taken for granted for hundred of years may shift.

1294,"**Late Bronze Age collapse**

The Late Bronze Age collapse involved a dark age transition period in the Near East, Asia Minor, the Aegean region, North Africa, Caucasus, Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, a transition which historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive. The palace economy of the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. The half-century between c. 1200 and 1150 BC saw the cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms, of the Kassite dynasty of Babylonia, of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and the Levant, and of the Egyptian Empire; the destruction of Ugarit and the Amorite states in the Levant,  the fragmentation of the Luwian states of western Asia Minor, and a period of chaos in Canaan. The deterioration of these governments interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy in much of the known world.

In historiography, ancient Rome is Roman civilization from the founding of the city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, encompassing the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic and Roman Empire until the fall of the western empire.

The civilization began as an Italic settlement in the Italian peninsula, dating from the 8th century BC, that grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the empire developed. The Roman empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world, though still ruled from the city, with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometres at its height in AD 117.In its many centuries of existence, the Roman state evolved from a monarchy to a Classical Republic and then to an increasingly autocratic semi-elective empire. Through conquest, cultural, and linguistic assimilation.

Fiat currency does not have a fixed supply, it can be inflated to near infinity. That is the main difference between fiat and other currencies.

Crypto with a fixed supply is not fiat, because you can't make more of it. 

Fiat currency originated in Rome. Their silver coins (Dinarius) were 100% pure. But they couldn't increase their ""money supply"" because they needed a lot more silver. So, they decoupled their money from the ""silver standard"". Allowing them to replace let's say 5% of the silver in a coin with other metals, then use the 5% of ""free"" silver to make new coins. This is similar to how governments are printing new money. Needless to say, this tactic didn't work out for the Romans. Near the end of Rome, the silver coins had less than 0.6% silver.",19-02-22-23-58,1,34,CryptoNoob-17,athans

A closed system like the one you are describing will have no defense against any type of majority attack. Since all nodes are centralized any 51% attack will 100% succeed.

The ground truth is the price; its the only number which illustrates the real balance between the demand for savings vs spending in btc.  The reality is that the price at which sufficient people will spend to meet the demand of those who want to save is around ~4000 usd worth per btc. That is about the amount of value to cover 1 year of eating at restaurants for the average middle aged american.

These technical indicators are positive for the health of the network, but they dont prove anything about if or when the price of bitcoin will go up. More realistically, the price of the dollar going down will push the value of bitcoin up. Ultimately, the dollar as we know it today must devalue or die, so this is somewhat inevitable. Hard to say when , but probably later than we think.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the blockchain technology still have ways to go and I like the potential independance it can give people from the government, but seriously if you analyze this rationally you're going to understand that first, complete unregulation (freedom) from banks and government might not be so good OR feasible, and that bitcoin is just one of potentially infinite solutions that blockchain can create, and it probably won't be definitive.

Personally I think Bitcoin still have ways to go too, and that at worst it will be a great experience that may in the future change the financial and monetary landscapes, but I also think a lot of people are betting a bit too much on this. Sure, I do think it's price will rise again, but it doesn't take a genius to see that mass adoption and usage of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general is simply light-years away, and for a simple reason: the average person doesn't even have the basic requirements (let's not forget the average of person of the world have difficulties even creating an e-mail or log in Facebook) to start to understand Bitcoin/crypto, much less adopt and use it. They don't have the necessary basic knowledge, nor the financial mindset for it. Crypto is such a complicated topic that not even people with these basic skills have trouble grasping it and only an infinitesimal part of the adopters (which are by themselves not much) actually understand how crypto works, and understanding is essential to mass adopting.

2070,"That was badass. Though I would argue for a case study of Marco Polo’s description of “The Great Khan”.  The one reason Polo knew the mongols were increasingly a powerful empire was due to one of the first widespread implementations of paper money.

Khan forced all merchants and ‘citizens’ to conduct business in his paper notes made from mulberry tree bark. Each note was stamped by politically powerful entities, with the threat of death for counterfeiters and anyone caught not accepting the notes.

Merchants traveling from India would bring heaps of gold, trade Khan the gold at a price higher than they could get anywhere else, and he would give them a note from his seemingly endless supply of mulberry trees. The Indian travelers could then live the high life on the journey back, and use these notes just as they would gold, anywhere in the mongol empire. 

Khan soon amassed nearly all physical gold, because of two main reasons: First, his notes were recognized widely as money. Second, it became obsolete to have to carry physical gold as a merchant. 

Through our little club, bitcoin will grow and acceptance will spread. It will then become increasingly obsolete in certain situations to hold value and pay with other forms of money. Particularly when fungibility and security meet the digital world.

>Abstract. Temporary blockchain forks are part of the regular consen-
sus process in permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin. As forks can
be caused by numerous factors such as latency and miner behavior,
their analysis provides insights into these factors, which are otherwise
unknown. In this paper we provide an empirical analysis of the an-
nouncement and propagation of blocks that led to forks of the Bitcoin
blockchain. By analyzing the time differences in the publication of com-
peting blocks, we show that the block propagation delay between miners
can be of similar order as the block propagation delay of the average
Bitcoin peer. Furthermore, we show that the probability of a block to
become part of the main chain increases roughly linearly in the time
the block has been published before the competing block. Additionally,
we show that the observed frequency of short block intervals between
two consecutive blocks mined by the same miner after a fork is conspic-
uously large. While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation,
other causes are also possible. Finally, we show that not only the time dif-
ference of the publication of competing blocks but also their propagation
speeds vary greatly.

Conclusion...

>5 Conclusions & Future Work
We provided an empirical analysis of the announcement and propagation of
Bitcoin blocks that caused blockchain forks. The large differences in the first
announcements of competing blocks indicate that the block propagation delay
between miners can be of similar order as the observed 50 % block propagation
percentile. The probability of a block to become part of the main chain increases
linearly in the headstart (i.e., the time the block has been published before the
competing block) between 100 ms and 10 s (from less than 70 % to more than
80 %). The observed frequency of block intervals between two consecutive blocks
mined by the same miner to be less than 100 seconds is conspicuously large.
While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation, other causes are also
possible.
A better understanding of the factors influencing the propagation speed of
specific blocks might be gained by an in-depth analysis of (orphaned) blocks and
client implementations. Furthermore, our analysis might profit from more data,
especially on recent forks. While the reduced frequency of forks is generally good
for the system, it is unfortunate for empirical research.",19-02-22-17-35,3,33506,Cryptolution,ate73t

2276,Yes if I'm a selfish miner I now have many ways to affect the speed of propagation of my blocks across the network.  I can create blocks that will propagate slower or faster depending on my selfish mining strategy.  New technies are being tested new options available. Large mining pools have their own networks now that move blocks much faster and you can build your own blocks to be harder to confirm so they propagate much slower. ,19-02-22-17-35,0,15281,StoneHammers,ate73t
2277,"I think the same confirmation time would provide more certainty with faster blocks, given nobody has 51% (then nothing can give certainty). 

Say an evil entity has 40% of the hash rate. Correct me if I’m wrong but I’d say for any block, they’d have 40% chance of mining it before someone else does, no matter the difficulty. Getting ahead of other miners would be equally difficult with 5 minute blocks. I think the probability this evil entity will succeed in an attack without having 51% is only decided by the number of blocks we wait before accepting a transaction and the percentage of hash rate this evil entity has. The block time should not affect the chance of this entity mining a block.",19-02-22-17-35,0,6,Sebastiaan240,ate73t
2278,"Why not make this reasonable amount of time shorter? The only disadvantage I see is a higher orphanage rate, but is that really such a problem, given the current rate? Even if we all use lightning, faster blocks means faster channel opening and closing.

From a safety perspective, I suppose orphaning rate would double. However in the same amount of time (10 minutes) you can get a higher certainty of confirmations. Assume orphaning rate is now
1% (which it is not). It would become 2%. However in 10 minutes, which would be 2 blocks, the chance there are still 2 chains is the chance of 2 orphans in a row. Since 0.02 * 0.02 < 0.01, two 5 minute blocks give a higher certainty than one 10 minute block.",19-02-22-17-35,1,6,Sebastiaan240,ate73t
2279,"It doesn't. But it does double the effect of block propagation issues and connectedness in the network. If your mining farms are connected with very high speed internet, you have an advantage over others that might have an average of 100ms delay. That is a very conservative estimate.  100ms = 0,1 sec = 1/6.000th of the time between to blocks on average. That doubles in 5 minute blocks. There are also other factors like AsicBoost to consider.

•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 


Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Example - there's a step near the beginning where he has to make a bitcoin public/private keypair. I think he expected that when you generate a keypair, you would get two keys out (but technically you only need one, the private key). So ... they probably should have unpacked that a bit more and said, here's all this crypto, once you are done, you have a private key. If you need a public key, you put in your private key and you get a public key out. Etc.

It's funny because bitcoin (in my opinion) is SUPER JANK and clearly the work of a brilliant person who was a somewhat average coder, but with an incredible imagination, and ... it works!

If you're using a custodial wallet and the wallet loses all the info, then the satoshis are lost.

> Information technology has neglibible natural resource content. Information technology is highly portable, it’s not reliant on one place, so a certain area doesn’t have the same kind of control over it. GM can’t pack up its car plants and fly off to another country over night, but a software company can.Information technology lowers the scale of enterprise. Firms will be smaller and more agile, with more competitors. Less opportunities for monopoly.Smaller enterprises means it will be harder to secure above-market wages, since there will be more competitors and less control by employees. Unions lose their power.Information technology lowers capital costs, which will increase competition and entrepreneurship. This will also reduce barriers to exit, making it easier for companies to go under, and less likely that banks will rescue and bail them out.Information technology has a shorter product cycle. Products will become obsolete faster, so any gains from extorting above-market wages will be short lived.Information technology is not sequential but simultaneous and dispersed. Unlike the assembly line, info tech can accommodate multiple processes at once. It’s possible for people to work together without ever seeing each other. Telecommuting will accelerate.Microprocessing will individualize work, away from the standardized work of the assembly line. This will also increase income inequality, since one programmer can write an algorithm worth millions, while another working at an identical laptop could create nothing of value. Resentment between those who create value and those who don’t will increase.

2450,"I would not say that the energy/material consumption of Bitcoin is a feature, more a necessary evil. The mining reward is roughly equal to the wealth spent mining, the difference of gold mining for example is that it is mostly electricity.  


The reason that there has been some mining in very poor countries is mostly a result of price fixing for electricity like in Venezuela. The cheapest electricity prices for the miners will always be the subsidized prices like the special rate for high-energy industry that the state can grant, but that mostly happens to attract industry that gives a lot of labor for the locals. The subsidized electricity prices will be lower than the actual cost of production of electricity anywhere in the world.  


But even in the case of practically free energy, energy that is produced that can not be sold or stored for later, even then it depends on the prices they can get the mining hardware for, and if they are geographically challenged and unable to sell their surplus electricity directly, then the likelihood of getting machines at a price that gives a ROI before depreciation is still low.

Gold miners have to produce electricity where there is gold in the ground and then they use the electricity (often diesel generated) to pump mercury and other poison into the earth. So i really don't understand how you think gold mining is even in the same environmental league as bitcoin mining.

Poor countries with subsidized electricity are a tiny niche in the mining eco system.  Venezuelan miners still run rigs like the ones  bought out of the KnC miner bankruptcy 4 years ago!!!. If electricity costs 0 then planned obsolescence of the rigs isn't relevant anymore. At 0 per KwH rigs are always profitable but this is obviously a marginal part of the mining eco system.

I am referring to energy without any potential buyers.  This market definitely is one of bitcoin's USP's or do you know another industry that can operate anywhere and be up and running in a matter of weeks?

As an example ca. 40% of global hydro power production is not being used and bitcoin is the only industry that can absorb it. Absorbing this volume would already allow for a $1.000.000 bitcoin price with a marginal environmental impact.

There are many more examples of how bitcoin miners are buyers of last resort. the solar plant that was completed in the Atacama dessert without a grid connection in place for instance. That project would have gone bankrupt if it wasn't for bitcoin miners. They were the only ones able to absorb that supply in short notice. If it wasn't for bitcoin miners that project would have been sold for pennies to the $, probably to the corrupt officials that made sure the grid connection wasn't delivered in time;)

Your assumption that it is hard and expensive to move miners across the planet is flawed. Planned obsolescence for mining rigs went from 3 months in 2014 to 3 years in 2019. This makes shipping mining rigs always possible and cheap. This is not exactly the case for transporting electricity.

That is what some people envisioned, but it is up to economics when this happens, which depends on price and usage. There is an economical limit on fees spent for electricity. Otherwise Bitcoin would not be efficient and traditional payment system would not be replaced. Bitcoin has to be more efficient by orders of magnitude, essentially eliminating transaction cost (currently at 2% of GDP).

2460,"The name is a reference to ""green-eyed jealousy"" google ""color of jealousy"" and the first thing that comes up is: "" Dark green is associated with ambition, greed, and jealousy "" it is also common to describe greed and finance in general. Green is associated with many things, but usually not generosity, which is why I think green generosity is fitting.  


First point about gold: I am bring up gold in Bitcoins defense, gold uses a lot of resources to be mined, somewhere around 100 billion per year in work that will never come back. The price of gold is roughly equal to the amount of material, labor, energy that will be used to mine it and currently about 100 Billion dollars is mined per year in Gold. As you point out there can be other environmental costs in addition. But the gold once mined does not require much energy to secure.  


For Bitcoin to maintain $1 000 000 it would require 657 Billion per year, or 1.8 Billion per day of money more of Bitcoin being bought than sold even if the energy used was clean. That is a lot of money spent to maintain the price of something, it is total overkill for what the network is used for currently, and unlike gold there is nothing that remains if Bitcoin mining stops in the future. More than the military spending of the US. But in 10 block halvings $1 000 000 works out to about 1.8 million per day without fees, which seems more reasonable.  


Norway (as an example) which has and sells a lot of hydroelectric power already made an exception for tax subsidies for crypto mining, they removed the subsidy for crypto specifically, every other energy intensive industry still gets the subsidy, but they did not want crypto miners. They say the reason is environmental, but I think the real reason is that they realize that there will not be much local labor or supporting industries, that they will get less in taxes than what they have to pay to subsidize.  


It is interesting that for the first time ever it is possible to have a sort of price floor for production of energy which does not require large infrastructure or materials, but even if the environmental impact of crypto was 0, the wealth creation of securing the network alone is also close to 0, it just needs enough security, not more.",19-02-22-13-42,1,1,greengenerosity,atc10e

Yes, housing used to be assigned to you, and private ownership was only legalized in late 80s. But the real fun started in early 90s where they made it so anyone can privatize a place they live in, for free but within some limits, and all the communal property started flowing into people's hands. It wasn't that fast - i think i read something like 50% of it got privatized by 2000, but the program kept being extended and is still ongoing. Everyone was (and still is) registered to a specific place by a central database, so proof and documentation wasn't a problem.

Interesting enough, around 2000 is also when mortgages became legal, and a few years later the property prices started to climb really fast - $2k for a 3 room apartment in late 90s, $15k for a one room apartment in 2001-ish, $100k for a 3 room apartment in 2005. I suspect it got more to do with lack of supply as the new generation grew up and started trying to move out, however. Loans still weren't a big thing by the time 2008 happened, so it wasn't that much of an event here and acted more as vaccination against mortgages - stories of people getting burned are still circulating as warnings that you shouldn't take one, and property prices had been slowly going down ever since.

Yeah, that is crazy, but aren't there cultural norms in Russia that you stay home until you marry. And sometimes even after that in most of the country? Its typical to have 3-4 generations in a home in a lot of Europe, provided it can support the family size(s). And for a lot of its History when the opportunity arises its common to buy a home nearby, but with the modern economy and the limited opportunies for the youth, traveling and moving away from home for work is a must so it likely contributes to that squeeze on housing supply as it is in the Urban US.

Those are usually the first things that get compromised in revolutions/coups, and the State can selectively destroy things for land grabs. Especially if its an enterprising despot that took power who is looking to sell land for resources to multi-nationals for a cash stream. 

Normally, I would agree, as enforceability means having some type of private force to take the land back with force if needed if the arbitration system fails you, but as many local governments are experimenting with it (pay taxes and such) its actually rather interesting development that may lead to it being recognized. Its still early days, of course.

However, transactions per day are growing and are now on the same level as it was around October and November (\~330,000/day), yet the fees have stayed low. It will be interesting to see what happens when we're in the \~400,000/day territory like in December 2018 and January 2019. My expectation is that fees will remain acceptably low, and the fee pressure will only manifest itself at around \~450,000/day. Hopefully that's still at least 5-6 months away, and by then a few more larger players adopt segwit, so the fees can remain low.

2578,"Number of nodes is the not the bottleneck for LN adoption. Base layer transaction capacity is because you need to create LN wallets with channels.

Theoretically you can open 10 channels with one transaction, so theoretically we can onboard 400,000 entities to LN in one day. In practice much less, because LN is just one of many uses of Bitcoin. Still, if LN really works well at large scales, and is widely used and accepted, which I think has a high chance of happening, we can easily onboard at least a million people to LN every week.

In a year we can onboard 50-60 million people. That's the size of a nation like the UK. Let's just hope we can reach this kind of capacity limit! It would mean the user base grew 10x.

However, all speculation goes out of the window at this adoption rate, because at every 2x user growth, we grew 10x in Bitcoin price. When we have tens of millions of Bitcoin users, the price will be astronomically high, which changes everything.

However, IIUC this is a reduction in the witness part not the main transaction part, and that's already discounted 4x in Segwit, so you don't get much increase in total capacity by shrinking the signatures. In turn, since the performance gain per transaction is small, that will also make the incentive for adoption small (although there are also some other benefits).

Am I correct in thinking that blocks are currently ~90% full?  I know that block sizes are averaging just over 1Mb with witness data, but the non-witness data is nearing 1Mb.  For example, this chart: http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-congestion/

2583,"Right, so the 3.7 MB number will be for the theoretical gain if transactions were deliberately crafted to make the biggest block you possibly could, ie if not only were all the transactions SegWit, but those transactions were designed to use lots and lots of witness data (which the post-SegWit counting allows lots of) and hardly any non-witness data (which the post-SegWit counting doesn't affect). In practice you'd only actually make blocks this big if you were attacking the network or trying to prove a point.

Currently blocks are nearly full, but most transactions are still not using SegWit. If more transactions start using SegWit, you'll end up with a bigger witness section, which is counted less towards the definition of ""full"", and allows for more transactions.

Consider that anyone could trivially send out tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions pay 1 satoshi/byte (100,000 txs * 250 bytes * 1 satoshi/byte = 0.25 BTC). With functional fee estimation algorithms, these transactions should not increase fees for anyone paying more than 1 satoshi/byte.

I think the best metric is the [number of bytes of transactions](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2h) (or more precisely, weight) at each fee level in the mempool.

That would bring the max transaction capacity up by 15-25%, especially if more people used native segwit addresses (starting with bc1...) which is even more efficient than segwit. And then we will have Schnorr (if all goes well), adding another 25% on top of that. More batching by large entities can give us another 10%.

But tail emission is nonworkable either, because over time, whatever reward is payed, compared to the overall networks market cap and assets to be secured, it's going to be minuscule.

It is also possible to do tail emissions that itself slowly grow over time but does not have a compounding effect like a percentage based inflation. Or it could be an emission that looked more like a natural logarithm over time where it grows, but the rate which it grows is slower over time. The total supply of Bitcoin itself could be modeled to fit as well.  


The options is not either compounding towards infinity or tending towards zero when it comes to block rewards in the case that fees is not enough.

If you can squeeze in that many transactions and still keep the block size small, that would be cool.

But to be honest, even then base layer Bitcoin sucks for consumers. The fact alone, that inclusion into a block is a probabilistic event that can take anywhere between 1 second and 3 hours makes it unattractive for day to day use anyway.

I predict, that no matter how many transactions fit into the base layer, the vast majority of consumer transactions will be in higher layers, even if there's no significant price difference.",19-02-22-06-46,1,3752,Renben9,at7i0v

As long as the fees are small enough that it is possible to incrementally put Bitcoin into and out of cold storage over time it will not stop that from happening. But if the chain security comes from something like a sustained $10 per transaction or more fee it will lock out that sort of personal storage.  


Fees does not need to be almost free, they just need to be cheap enough for whatever its usecase is.  


People being able to put money into and out of Bitcoin on-chain is necessary for it to not become a token in central banks, exchanges and applications.

I actually think that his is what is going to happen and what is inevitable and not that bad actually.

First, we have to differentiate between transaction and payment. Transaction the data that is in the block in a physical sense and payment is what a person wants to do in an economic sense.

I also think, that not only will higher layer applications be the most consumer level used payments engine, no matter what the price in the base layer is.

I also think that 100k people counter-balancing their funds^(in the sense that Alice owes Bob 10 sat, bob owes Charlie 10 sat, so Alice simply pays Charlie 10 sat, instead of Alice paying Bob and Bob paying Charlie) and making then one transaction on chain to settle that is the only feasible solution.

A non-trusted, or minimally trusted, method is LN.

But I also have absolutely no problem with using banks for that. Banking is not the devil. In a free market, banks fulfill a very important role. And without the possibility of inflation through money printing (i.e. 21mil hardcap intact) or credit expansion (constant prove of reserves, no fractional reserve bitcoin-banking), they really are tied in what they can do with the funds.

And maybe even all of that is doable without the banks being even possible to run with the money, using elaborate multi-sig and time-lock contracts.

I'm not saying this is a scam, but can you please point out a page on the actual domain blockfi.com that references the blockfi.typeform.com link?

A quick glance has not shown me where it is on the actual blockfi.com site. Meanwhile, the article from bitcoinmagazine references it from 2 months ago saying nothing more than they plan to do it. And both the form and the T&C doc are offsite (on other domains)? Meanwhile, you're typing in all sorts of personal info and your ssn into the form which may be going to someone else.

Also, it asks for SSN but then says to put in all 1s if you're not US citizen. There are people who are not US citizens who have SSNs, which makes this question weirdly ambiguous and unlikely that a financial institution would make such a mistake, nor say something like ""put all 1's if you're not us citizen"".

Also also, neither the company news or blog mention this. And the reddit account to post this is OpSecThrowaway3, a 1 week old account.

    bf: Welcome to BlockFi, please let me know if you have any questions!
    me: Hi.
    me: Can you confirm that there is a form to sign up for a bitcoin interest account?
    bf: Of course! We're in the process of launching the product. The BIA is currently in beta and invites were extended to existing customers of BlockFi and their referrals
    bf: The BIA is launching publicly first week of March
    bf: Did you get an invite?
    bf: Happy to onboard you or answer any questions
    me: I received information about this from a friend, he sent me a link to sign up, but it was at an external domain, typeform.com and the T&C doc at another domain, docdro.id.
    me: I was hoping you could confirm those are legit.
    bf: The T&C's will be sent to you when we send you the beta invite. To prevent people tampering with the typeform, we usually send it out. May I have your email so we can send you the beta invite?
    me: Thanks! My email is [redacted].
    bf: The beta invite is on a typeform for now. However, in the first week of march, we will have a redesigned homepage and dashboard for both our products.
    me: Great. Thank you very much for your help.
    bf: What's your first name for our records by the way
    me: [redacted]
    me: Thanks!
    bf: You'll receive an email from us shortly
    me: Have a nice day.

I got this email super quick. It gave me 2 urls, one for personal and one for business and both were on typeform but the generated urls were different. I suspect they generate new urls for everyone.

The doc from OP's checksum matched the ones they sent to me via email, which was from a different site so I assume the docdro.id was something OP uploaded.

My email also had a one page document that I uploaded here:
https://docdro.id/abQlu8Y

In conclusion. It seems legit but I can't vouch for original typeform link. Anyways, there's no reason you should follow any links from here. You should initiate a chat with a blockfi rep and ask for an email so they can send you your own link.

**I noticed that your Twitter DMs are open. What kind of messages are you getting from the crypto community?**  
A range of messages, some blaming me for having lost all their money in crypto and some offering to give me their perspectives on what’s going on in crypto. I do prefer if people reach out directly to my office. It’s just an easier way to be able to communicate with people. I’m not particularly quick at responding to the DMs.

**But they are open, so I guess you do want to hear some of what people have to say.**  
I’m always eager to hear from people, and I think people in this space always have interesting thoughts. I like hearing from people who don’t normally interact with the SEC because part of the message I want to get across to people is that if we’re going to put a regulatory framework in place that is going to affect what you can and can’t do, I really want to know what you think.

**How does it feel when someone blames you for losing their life savings?**  
My heart goes out to people who have lost a lot of money, whether it’s in this kind of investment scam or any kind of investment scam, and that’s why I really do encourage people, whether it’s crypto or whether it’s any other kind of investment, to ask lots of questions. And if you can’t get answers and if you don’t understand how something works, my suggestion is that you shouldn’t invest. I’m always sad when people get hurt, but I do think that it can be a good lesson for them and the rest of us that you need to to be skeptical and be careful.",19-02-22-02-06,3,257,mreporter001,at45e2

A quote for you to contemplate  

> Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party",19-02-22-01-45,1,87,igadjeed,at3x5a

After all, Eberhard was the CEO for four years before being booted out. You should read the other link I posted: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-the-origin-story-2014-10

> Eberhard was becoming a star. He was featured as a face of Research in Motion's campaign for the BlackBerry Pearl in 2006. His claim to fame, according to the ad, was that he ""created the first electric sports car.""
> While the media attention may have been good for Tesla, it left Musk feeling neglected.

If you keep reading, it's clear that it was actually Musk that was jealous of Eberhard's success. If it really was Eberhard on the sidelines, Musk wouldn't have needed to forcefully boot Eberhard out of the company. Also, did you read the part where Musk ignored the agreement to give Eberhard the second Roadster, then gave him the third Roadster only after it crashed? Gee, Musk sure is a nice person.

Okay, fine. I'll attack the Mars strawman that you gave me. First of all, how am I going to attack an argument where the argument is ""planning to put humans on Mars""? Yes, I'm sure he's planning on putting people on Mars, but saying that vs doing that are not the same thing. Did you hear about Mars One. They planned on going to Mars. Didn't happen. Even if they had a rocket to go to Mars, there are just so many things left unsolved that make the Mars mission so difficult. How do we shield the astronauts from radiation? How do we prevent bone loss from extended space travel to Mars? And many other questions!

But wait, he actually wants to colonize Mars! Believe me, I'm all for colonizing other planets but we're just not there yet and claiming to be able to do this without having first solved the main problems is not promising. I know the argument of colonizing is so that in case there is a world-wide apocalypse, we still have humans left. However, with a colony that will need regular supplies to survive, if that were to happen the people on Mars are going to soon die off in a world that makes Antarctica look like a paradise. If you want my opinion on this, the whole colonization things is a hyperbole used to get people to invest in SpaceX. They're sure going to need funding after missing the target of the last $500 million funding round, not getting the contract for the Lucy mission, and being left out of the air force's next-generation rocket program.",19-02-22-01-12,0,122,540degrees,at3l1a
3099,"It's so easy to say this though. Tons of people live ""life on easy mode"", none of them do even a fraction of what he's done. He's turned what he had into something exponentially bigger, revolutionary, visionary. What have you done with what you have?",19-02-22-01-12,4,6623,rmonik,at3l1a

Edit: Great answer by Blockonomics there:

- One of the reason they are getting less payments is because they are using BitPay that generates [QR code not supported](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/a7qv37/bitpay_is_fcking_up_bitcoins_adoption/) by major bitcoin wallets
- Second all BTC merchants [have low volume](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/chainalysis-bitcoin-payments-down-almost-80-this-year/) currently in the bear market
- Wanted to understand what maintaining costs they are talking about. They can easily switch to other bitcoin payment gateways and have zero cost.

>Imagine being paid in BTC

if it's a P2P service - fuck taxes.

it is not yet common to have a full time contract and payment in bitcoin will most likely be set in FIAT rate per month or FIAT hourly rate. so you get X amount of FIAT but in bitcoin at current rate.

paying taxes happens once a year, doesn't need to be borderless, uncensorable and immutable, not even fast. just given tx amounts this is the least important (half ass 3rd party) implementation of bitcoin payment up to date.

As a matter of fact, any large consumer based business could start offering LN node hosting just in a similar way they all offer a credit card account.

If you trust Eclair to make good decisions, well, I guess good for you then, but in my opinion it is significantly better to run your own node and connect your wallet to that, that way you get to decide things such as: what forks to follow, what upgrades to download, what network to connect to, and what blockchain to store your funds on. I think it's better to make those decisions yourself rather than let a company do it for you, but some people don't want to pay that much attention to this space, so if you're comfortable letting Eclair make decisions like that, it's not evil or anything.

In 1970, Richard Nixon signed the [Bank Secrecy Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act), and turned money into a system of control. A system of control that attempts to use money as a political tool, in order to control who is able to send and receive it, who they are able to send money to, and aims, ultimately, to the complete surveillance of all financial transactions worldwide. Complete, total, totalitarian financial surveillance. This change 50 years ago has gradually percolated through every country in the world, every financial service in the world, every bank in the world.

In 1970, Richard Nixon *deputized* the financial services field, to turn them into a branch of law enforcement. Law enforcement beyond borders, law enforcement beyond jurisdictions, and, most importantly, law enforcement beyond due process, beyond political and democratic control, beyond recourse.

You're right, it's not. But a regulated Money Service Business needs to take steps to ensure their service isn't used for illegal activities. They are legally required to do this of they'll lose their license.

Companies like Venmo and Paypal have a compliance department that looks for potentially illegal activity and will flag you for it. Venmo's system looks for keywords, similar to how Google Pay or Wallet or whatever it was called did it. This is stupid, but it helps them stay in compliance. 

Keep in mind that these companies aren't required to do business with you.

4150,"Trade is the great pacifier. The old adage, ""No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war"" is eerily true. Trading partners are loathe to go to war and wreak scorched-earth on each other. After all, if Acme Inc. has factories on both sides of the border, it wants to see neither factory bombed to oblivion (and will be willing to lobby each nation's government back from the brink of war). In the lead up to both World Wars, there were massive economic sanctions and suspensions of trade across the national borders that would eventually erupt into hostilities.

Tariffs (a particular strain of trade sanctions) are completely misunderstood in the popular consciousness. They are sold to the public as ""evening out trade between two nations."" They do no such thing. A tariff is a subsidy -- corporate welfare -- paid out of the pockets of the domestic public. ""My tariff is costing the Chinese a lot of money."" Phooey. Your tariff is costing *Americans* a lot of money, Mr. President.

The domestic suppliers in the tariffed industry are relieved of the burden of direct price/quality competition with foreign suppliers *at the expense of the domestic consumers*. The relief to domestic suppliers is in direct proportion to the expense borne by domestic consumers because it is domestic consumers which are forced to either pay a higher price for foreign products, or to accept domestic products of inferior quality, ceteris paribus. (The only reason domestic consumers will purchase foreign products at the same price-point is because they are of superior quality. And, obviously, if they can get the same quality at a lower price, they will go with that option). Steel tariffs are an excellent example. The steel suppliers, like US Steel, are massive beneficiaries of steel tariffs. But who pays? Not foreign steel suppliers. No, it is Americans - who utilize goods made from steel - who pay. Threatening foreign nations with tariffs and economic sanctions is like threatening to shoot yourself in the foot.

There are other, more destructive forms of economic sanctions, such as embargoes, and so on. It is a euphemism to refer to these as ""economic sanctions"" - they are really [economic warfare](https://mises.org/library/evil-sanctions).

Think of a bank branch as your local “store”. Their cash is their inventory. 

Some branches never sell/withdraw any cash because people don’t really need it in their area. People use cards and ATMs for almost everything.

Cash movement is tracked and reported back to the mothership and armored trucks only drop off the cash that’s anticipated based on average client activity. They need to ensure they have enough cash everyday for ALL clients (emergency cash can always be ordered but they will charge that branch’s cost center most likely and the manager will hear about it).

This may or may not be true but the targeted country, *as a whole,* suffers no detriment because, as prices on the tariffed good decrease slightly, consumers of the tariffed good in the targeted country are able to purchase it at those lower prices. In addition, global demand from other buyers increases as the price goes down. The simple fact is that the US government can't do a damn thing to punish the Chinese economy.

Bitcoin is called out regularly for its mining energy requirements, and it’s only fair that people realise that this isn’t a problem unique to Bitcoin or any proof of work protocol.

There are already mining operations taking advantage of renewable energy setups. That being said, there is still a lot of work to do.

With respect to miners shutting down, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is defined against the amount of hash rate on the network mining for block rewards. The difficulty adjustment ensures that blocks are mined every ten minutes. The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks to reflect the current hash rate. E.g. if there’s fewer miners and the has rate is lower, the difficulty to mine the block resuces in order to retain the ten minute block reward. If a large number of machines turned off at the same time, the amount of time to mine the blocks for the remaining machines would increase, until the 2016th block is reached, and the difficulty adjusts again based on the reduced hash rate.

I've given this a great deal of thought these past years as the community's attitude changed vastly after it broke 1k, and I've come to the conclusion that while the pre-2013 community and the mentality that followed it is by far the minority, it still exists and is still the driver of some of the best projects in this space.

If all you do is hang out here, and never go to a meetup or hacker-spaces than your view will ultimately be skewed to reflect that.

I'm not sure something like Satoshi Forest, and the amazing out-pour the community had with it, would fly would it be tried at this time but I think those of us that were around back then always knew that if this were to become what we needed it to be, we had to on onboard the average individual, who as you mentioned only cares about it as an investment vehicle. And that's to be expected.

Bitcoin never lost its Cypherpunk and Cryptoanarchist core, and this is just a matter of optics if you delve into it, but if you want proof just look into BTC's involvement in just these recent events: Ukraine Maidan Revolution, Venezuela's hyperinflation and currency collapse. Nopara's work with Wasabi is a good privacy project, as is Samurai's work in that space. Starkbot and the Lightening lab's Team is helping build a 'privacy default' system with Lightening network and is the most compelling part of the 2nd layer.

In short, the maxims outlined in Bitcoin's White paper is and have always outlived any FUD/Hardfork BS if you look close enough.

Moreover, as a person who was called 'crazy' on the BTF in the 'good old days' for what I thought BTC could do back in 2011, only to see Mega corps like IBM adopt 'Blockchain' do just that; who I eventually joined for a period due to my background, so I think its absurd to rely on (perceived) public sentiment to dictate your path forward with this tech.

So, I think I can say with some experience that its best to just go and make the progress you want to see (and subsequently fail and then continue to iterate) in this ecosystem rather than try to convince and wait for others to follow your message or ideas. I think that's what Opensource technology allows.

Ultimately, if you do succeed people will take notice and will ask how to get involved.

I'll take this current stage with a vast array of promising progress and a more somber online community tone rather than the crazy hey-days we had back then with no real idea of how we'd get there, if I'm honest; if I want my dose of enthusiastically crazy optimism, I'll just to hang out with Aerospace and EV people.",19-02-21-01-52,5,376,Melting_Harps,asp6xe

Your ideal solution is going to be two Tails VMs. One offline which hold the wallets, and another Tails VM which you hold the watch wallet (and use to transact and get the receiving addresses you want to send the money to). That is the safest.

Another approach is to simply move your funds to a properly capitalized exchange. What’s a capitalized exchange? It’s an exchange that can lose its bitcoin without going bankrupt.

4814,"OK, that's good to know. Regardless of the standard that's being used, if you want to move money between wallets it's probably a good idea to use different seed phrases for security reasons. The reason that it would be tough to move to a new standard is all the existing users who have already backed up their BIP39 paper keys, and having multiple formats would mean longer syncing times - and we know that people hate syncing.

The idea of being able to import a seed is as a backup plan in case BRD were to completely disappear. I think it's important that you guys warn potential users that your wallet seed is unique to BRD and is not compatible with any other wallet out there. I guarantee you that a bunch of users see '12 word seed' and immediately think it is just like the Trezor seed--which it is NOT.",19-02-21-01-02,1,1364,bjman22,asonly

There isn't really a realistic scenario where BRD would just disappear. Not only is the derivation path open sourced and clearly defined, but our software is open sourced too. I guess I just fail to see a scenario where people would actually lose access to their coins. ",19-02-21-01-02,1,2656,chalash,asonly
4817,"You might be right...but assume this. Someone has a BRD wallet and their seed is safely stored. Then they either lose their phone or can't access their phone. So, now they try to 'recover' their wallet using many other wallets that are available that also use seed words. I guarantee you that over 90% of people who use BRD and have their seed words saved as a backup probably believe they can use those seed words to restore their wallet on a Trezor or some other wallet. But that is just not the case. 

ALL those other wallets use BIP39/BIP44 (except BRD), so they enter their seed words from BRD (eg. on a Trezor or Greenwallet etc) and they see an account with zero balance. Now they panic. Maybe for hours. Maybe in desperation they ask for help and some scammer tells them that they need their seed words and maybe they give them thinking that they lost their bitcoins anyways. In fact, what has occurred is that the wrong derivation was used. But this person doesn't know that. 

So, again, if you just make it clear to people that if they lose their phone they can only use their BRD seed words on another BRD wallet, it would save a lot of anxiety.

Yeah, that all sounds reasonable to me. I'll talk to the product team about adding some language to that effect.

I think Draper gets it on the money.

Yes small pockets don’t utilize it but, but let’s be real and say it covers the world. 

 But there are going to be a variety of reasons of why cash phases out, including easily accessible discount offers via crypto payments  and the normalcy of storage of your own personal funds on blockchains.

4875,"> Keys should only be able to be transferred from one person to another

Your post shows a flawed understanding of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, no person ever discloses their keys. Instead, they transfer value by spending a coin and signing the transaction with a key  

A Will might reveal keys an an executor, but the executor should do only one thing with the keys - immediately transfer all the value to a new key (or keys)  

Lost keys can not be passed to another person anyway. A lost key is lost forever, can not be reconstructed from fragments or using any clever mathematics  

Losing a key is not a problem if the coin has already been spent. Bitcoin value is lost only if a coin can not be spent. Coin expiry (maybe after 100 years) could allow the value of unspendable coins to be recirculated  

Coin expiry could be simple  
Change consensus rules to allow unsigned transactions  

*    if the coin being spent is more than 5.25 million blocks (100 years) old, **and**  
*    if the transaction has zero outputs  

A transaction with zero outputs will send all of its inputs to miner fees. The expired coin's value returns to circulation as part of the mining reward  

The Bitcoin ""community"" believes unspendable coins should remain unspendable because it makes the rest of the coins more valuable, a selfish view

'Recommended' hubs are not ideal as that would make the network less decentralized. the big hubs could start jacking up fees or censoring transactions and the everyday user would still use them, unless the app knew better paths (again this requires a lot of information). A third party server could certainly keep track of the network state and send the route to you. But again this would be centralized. The server might be sending all transactions through their own route or deliberately avoiding certain people.

5036,"It is possible to condense an entire block down to it's header and merkle root hash.  

That's enough proof that the block contained valid and verified transactions at some point in the past, it's now possible to discard that block after a period of time for most nodes using the pruning feature.  

Signatures for old blocks are not even checked by bitcoind  (I think it's only something like the last 6 months is verified)

Major nodes may want to retain these full audit/rebuild txs and we need a good number of these for new nodes to sync against but once synced most don't need this information.

Next comes segwit.  Certainly segwit transactions can have their signature data thrown away after a period of time since we only need to know the tx details for old transactions.  I'm not sure if segwit does currently throw away signature data yet though, my hunch is it doesn't yet but happy to hear otherwise.

The biggest issue with bitcoin is it's a linear log file recording everyone's transactions so will rightfully have an upper cap on tx throughput.

It shows just how remarkably fast we can scale something thought to have been years away in this ecosystem. I'm hyped regardless because much like Segwit this was what we should have been focusing on and directing our resources towards rather than the multitude of contentious hardforks and the endless bitching and division over the years.

5184,"Lol yes, I suppose it is.",19-02-20-18-00,0,1,cryptogrip,asl92s
5185,"Obviously it can not. The global financial system now consist of so much money that does not even exist, in any way or form. It is fundamentally impossible in the current system to settle all debt. Bitcoin is not dependent on debt, but bitcoin can be exchanged for (non-financial) goods and services. Bitcoin can be used for purchasing commodities. 

Obviously there will become a time that there will be wide spread bitcoin derivatives (altcoins?) and bitcoin-based debt, which will bring us to a partial centralization of these things again. There will always be such a thing, because there is a market for it. It does not mean it is a good idea, but many people spend lots of money on bad ideas.

The whole stock exchange market is currently also valued in USD (or other local fiat). This makes some sense to value the 'price' of the company, but there are no 'real' dollars behind this. This is just a part of the future revenue that is expressed in a price. These things can be expressed in any currency. If you take a big international company (like coca cola), and imagine the USD drops 90% overnight. Does this mean the future revenue of coca cola drops 90%? They will feel US inflation, but a large part of their sales is international, so their future revenue will probably only drop 20% or 30%. This means that their share price, denominated in USD will go up, because USD goes down. USD is just used as a way to account for future value, but it is not 'real' money.

Is bitcoin 'real' money. What is 'real' money. It can be a very semantic discussion, but the global financial system will never be replaced by a single ""unit of account"". It is not USD now, and it will not be BTC in the future. International trade is often denominated in USD, but this is not a requirement, all that is needed is both trading partners to agree on what unit of account to use and how much of this unit they will transfer for certain goods or services. The advantage of BTC is, that it is not bound to any state and by definition neutral. We will see an increased use of BTC in international trade, but this will be a transitional currency, and the trading partners will transfer this into their own fiat fairly fast. A bit further in the future, they will hold on to bitcoin, and at some point, a significant part of international trade will be denominated in bitcoin (or at least not in some kind of fiat).",19-02-20-18-00,3,134,ElephantsAreHeavy,asl92s

Vitalik should know better. He peddles the idea that POS' main virtue over POW is the environment. vitalik is obviously wrong because one of bitcoin's unique selling points is the fact that it is able to consume an unlimited amount of energy on a planet which has dramatically misallocated renewable energy resources. POW is the only industry that can operate anywhere, all that matters is cost of electricity. Because of this POW can give the geographically disenfranchised a chance to compete on the global market place by utilizing energy which they could not transport/sell before bitcoin came along. Today, we have babushkas in Siberia supporting their pensions via bitcoin mining. Who knows who will benefit next. We are merely minding the cradle of this new asset class and energy consumption is one of it's unique selling points. The fact that most people see energy consumption as a disadvantage makes me incredibly bullish on bitcoin long term.

Anyway, to me POS vs POW is not a technological but an ideological matter.

POS is rent seeking. It would turn the crypto revolution in yet another 'poor yield to the rich' scheme ran by the new version of the same cabal that's running things now.

POW rewards the every man going the extra mile, literally. If you are willing and able to set up shop in some remote place like kazachstan, iran, greenland and many more places few people would like to live, then you can make bank mining bitcoin even below $1000.

I'm not sure how you have quantified this. As someone who owns an electric car I would strongly disagree.

Tesla's have a good rep for a reason. The model 3 is the safest car according to the nhtsa who's authority it is to determine exactly that. did you know that Tesla also holds the number two and the number three spot for the model x and the model s?

That's not some freakish coincidence that's called excellent engineering.

When you are driving a zoomey deathbox around everyday I would say that safety is the most important factor of any vehicle. Besides that it drives like a Ferrari. <<<< exaggeration here. Please whip me to death for it!

Honestly I'm a little confused by your comment it almost seems like you have some hatred for Tesla that has made you biased and unaccepting of basic facts as they relate to this manufacturer.

Did you have a pre-order for a model 3 and then got pissed over the long-range battery? Something obviously happened to you for you to have this altered perception of reality. Were you born a hater? Clearly you've never driven one and you probably have not driven other electric cars either. If you had you certainly wouldn't have this opinion.

I've driven a variety of electric vehicles and nothing even remotely compares to a Tesla at this very moment. That will of course change in the future.

as for the repair system I'm not too worried about it. there are already people teaching other people by the hundreds how to salvage and repair Tesla's. this information is coming into public domain and in the future when there are old Tesla's that need service I think that there will be a vibrant ecosystem to repair them. Competition in the market will also force them to be better in their business model.

All I basically said was an opinion that any average electric car is better than a tesla, which is an opinion I hold due to the reason I singled out next - their current repair practices. A big reply like that with a ton of assumptions comes across as a hugely defensive tesla fanboy mad that someone doesn't agree. I honestly do ""like"" tesla and am thrilled that they've gotten the public into electric cars and proven that with current tech it's absolutely feasible to own and daily drive an electric car. I just don't like how everything is soooo complicated and so electronic.

I'm a car fan, my reason for liking the other electric cars are based mainly on their design. the tesla is a tech lovers dream, so much advanced stuff pretty much everywhere, it'll keep someone occupied for days straight playing around with everything.... but for your average Joe it's pretty darn complicated (at first glance or without help) I could just give a co worker the keys to a ""nissan, chevy, or VW"" electric car and they could take off with little adjustment, they already know how to adjust the mirrors and seats as there's only a few places that can be if it's not where it's expected. Now If I tossed them the keys to a tesla? And they have to do 95% through a screen? They'd probably be too scared to drive it, and would ask to borrow another car. Not everyone, but you can certainly see where I'm coming from, I work on computers and I'd hop right in and try to figure it out, but I can think of white a few people I know that wouldn't... Tesla has all the physical stuff I looooove, but I wish I could get a repackaged basic one that looks like a ICE car and has a traditional interior, but has no tech / driver assists and has their motors and batterys, and doesn't need excessive dealership attention. For example It would be hard for me to pass up something like an e golf with tesla's bat / motor.

Oh and to contribute to the Ferrari discussion, a tesla is more like a muscle car than a Ferrari. Muscle cars accelerate hard but don't brake and turn as well. A Ferrari is more like a go cart with it's instant neck snapping steering and braking response, and it also accelerates hard and can get to very high speeds. I know what you mean though, both are fast :) but to be technical muscle cars and sports cars handle so much differently. On a track the tesla even looks like a muscle car, pushing through corners with it's weight, but powering out onto the straight. And I bet the tesla would do an effortless muscle car style burn out.

Got a source on that? From my reading that [doesn't appear true](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-better-car-a-Tesla-or-a-Ferrari).

>However, almost nothing will compete with the unique blend of practicality and power Tesla offers. There’s no Ferrari that can compete with a P100D up to 70mph, so in city traffic or most driving you’ll ever do on public roads, Tesla will out-accelerate probably any Ferrari except a LaFerrari, but then we’re taking a family sedan vs the most expensive and powerful Ferrari ever made.

>A Tesla has insane amounts of storage etc, and the power on tap is available every single time. The Ferrari needs a solid combo of grip, weather, road and launch control to keep up. This is a small detail about the car of course, straight line acceleration is not really the important factor.

>But a P100D can keep up with a Rimac until 80mph, a LaFerrari, the most expensive and insane Ferrari, cannot, just because it’s way harder to have consistent off the line performance in an RWD combustion engine car.

>The Model S range, even leaving aside the pricy P model, will keep up with any Ferrari you want, it will be a more comfortable, and easier car to drive, it will be more consistent, and overall a far better buy, for a lot less money. In any aspect aside from track driving and flamboyance, yes Teslas are vastly superior cars, it’s all about what you want to get from it.

I read that entire thing and there's a lot of great discussion there about tradeoffs, pros vs con's, etc, but the general takeaway is that the Tesla absolutely **does** compete with the preformance of a ferarri, and even does better than the highest rated ferarri's in specific tests.

You can feel however you want, and I will feel however I want. This is a relevant discussion about apples to oranges in a lot of circumstances.

But claiming Tesla does not outpreform most of these cars in terms of speed, accelleration, handling, etc is a pointless endeavor. It does, in a lot of circumstances, and doesn't, in others. If you want to compare the 'luxury' aspects (e.g. those that have nothing to do with preformance) then obviously there are *tons* of stupidly expensive cars that beat tesla...and I frankly don't give a shit about any of that.

You pay the community for the set up of the legal framework on which you are able to agree to be  paid in return for your effort, for a community arbitrator (I.e the courts) to ensure enforcement of this agreement, to manage disputes, to ensure that your employer furnished a safe place for you to earn a living and to enforce and punish if not the case.


Sales

You pay the community for legal services to ensure clients pay for your organizations' services and goods rendered, to organise and provide physical space for you to store your factories, offices, display your goods, and to establish roads or communication networks for your customers to reach you and to trade with you.

Property

You pay the community for protection of your right to your own living space, for fire and crime protection, to organise and partition living space and commercial space to ensure peace and quiet and appropriate land use for everyone. And for a legal system to protect your claim to such a space.

Capital

You pay the community for the protection of your ownership, to lay a legitimate claim to your own assets, to support the communitys effort to ensure owners are paid their fair share while ensuring that employees, clients, and suppliers stake in your investments are also taken care of through various means, and to support community's effort to promote business and economic growth through trade deals, economic incentives, tax rebates, so that consumption and sales can grow and your investments can prosper.

I think there is a possibility of a self organizing system, perhaps like anarcho cap, wherein people are free to associate themselves with whichever community they feel best meet their needs, or to set up their own community that works towards their own betterment in their own values. Each community's ability to work with each other relies on some level of trust but also some balance of power in the matter of dispute resolution enforcement when things go sour. In such unfortunate cases it is likely the larger community has bargaining power but perhaps opting for the lack of bargaining power in the world is desirable for some people and we should allow people to handicap themselves by going with a small community if they insist on doing so.",19-02-20-14-27,3,3017,i_have_seen_it_all,asjbnx

You will chose what country or state you want to live in and pay taxes too based off the services that are provided to you by the taxes that you pay. 

Take America for example, imagine if Kansas offered you one year free tuition for every 4 years you paid state taxes, that would incentivize a lot of people to move there in order to take advantage of that offer. Imagine if Nebraska offered free medical coverage up too 25,000 dollars if you lived there and paid them state taxes. You have to use your imagination and realize that once the world has switched to a sound money everything becomes possible.

Obviously the ramifications are much higher on a country level but it still applies. No more pointless wars that lines the pockets of the .001%.
No more reckless government spending on things that don't directly affect the population living inside their country.

We will still pay taxes but we will get to decide to what state or country we pay them too based off what we see our taxes going too. Remember the blockchain is immutable, once a government has a budget any single person can verify every single transaction that happens during a fiscal year.

Galloping inflation occurred during the 1980s.

It took double-digit interest rates and a recession to stop galloping inflation. Thankfully, it hasn’t returned since then. The worst types of inflation are hyperinflation and stagflation.

The housing industry provides an example of both inflation and deflation. Until 2006, gradually rising prices attracted investors. They saw there was a chance to make money by buying now and selling later. This created more jobs as home builders tried to meet demand.

But between 2006 and 2010, the housing market experienced massive deflation. Prices fell 30 percent. Those who could afford to buy a house decided to wait until the market improved. The longer they waited, the lower prices dropped. 

Many people were trapped in their homes. They could not sell their homes for enough to cover the mortgages. They became upside-down. Eventually, they could not see any light at the end of the tunnel. Even those who could afford to keep paying, often just walked away. This sent prices even lower.",19-02-20-14-27,3,111,ArcticBambi,asjbnx

No one cares that people rent further and further out of town to be able to afford it and that cheese becomes ""cheese product"" and eventually just ""yellow sour brick"".

5891,"That’s assuming that the capitalization reasonably should be 1 million BTC.

Here comes even more ridiculous assumption napkin math. 

Let’s assume a transaction takes 1 second. And let’s assume a transaction is on average 0.01 BTC (or $40) and let’s say an average hop is 10 nodes long. Then a transaction will lock up 0.1 BTC for a second.

That then means that 1 BTC in the LN network can do 10 transactions per second.

I think the number typically compared with is the peak capacity of VISA which is around 40k/second.

So 4k BTC could transact as much as VISA. For one second. After that we have to worry how the BTC sloshes around there and channels will have to be kept funded in some way. Some of it could be on-chain transactions. But there are likely going to be very efficient rebalancing within the LN network. It won’t be that efficient to begin with but it will get better. 

If we assume that the rebalancing will take 10 times as long as doing the actual transactions then we will need 40k BTC.

We probably want a 10 times margin so I’ll wing I and say we want $400k for the network to be capitalized for global use. 

if BTC goes up in value then we’ll need less BTC to keep the nodes and channels funded.

This is of course a very naive analysis, but I think it gives some frame of reference to reason around capacity.

I’m going to stick my neck out and suggest that 400k BTC at current BTC/$, is a reasonable capitalization.

The battle to build crypto’s browser wallet
It’s browser wars all over again with the battle to own the gateway to the Web 3.0 space. The secret weapon that gives you access to dapps and manages your money and identity? Call it the “browlett.”
By Adriana Hamacher
News•7 min read•Feb 6, 2019

It’s Browser World War II! A half dozen crypto companies, ranging from giants such as Coinbase and Binance, to smaller startups such as AlphaWallet, are competing for market share in the growing cryptoverse. The battleground? An application—call it a “browlett”—that integrates a wallet, to safely store crypto, with a browser that connects to dapp marketplaces, services, exchanges and much more.

Just as Netscape and Internet Explorer—during the so-called Browser Wars—made Web 1.0 accessible for the first time to millions of people 25 years ago, the browlett is both the on ramp to Web 3.0, and its defining application. It adds the money layer to the social layer (Web 2.0.) to the Web 1.0 browser itself. And it’s set to be huge.

Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask, Brave are working on, or have released, new and improved mobile wallets that integrate dapp browsers. (See our round-up, here.) With the ability to surf a catalog of dapps, buy and sell tokens, manage collectibles, pay for services and tickets and access social media, the browlett could end up being at least as important as the browser was to  Web 2.0: The wallet-browsers will also control your identity, too.

“Wallets integrating with browsers (or vice versa) could do the same thing for crypto as Netscape did for the early web,” says Evgeny Ponomarev, co-founder & CEO at Fluence Labs, which is working on the infrastructure for Web 3.0. “However, the devil is in details and the delivery matters.”

Just yesterday, Coinbase announced that Coinbase Wallet users can now begin to store bitcoin directly in their wallet apps—a huge steps towards creating “the world’s leading user-custodied crypto wallet,” the company said in a statement. Previously, the app only supported Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum-based tokens, and Coinbase says it plans to add support for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the near future as well.

And early today, the OG browser company, Opera, released a beta version of its popular Android browser-wallet, which will allow users in Norway, Denmark and Sweden to buy Ether. Its older wallet has already been downloaded over 100 million times around the world.

For Ponomarev, whose firm analyzed the performance of 100’s of dapps, “the obstacle for the wallets which integrate dapp browsers is that they are limited by the current crypto user base.” He believes that Web 3.0. browsers, such as Opera, will provide new users with more freedom to explore dapps, without forcing them to jump in headfirst. “It looks for me like a smoother transition to dapp usage,” he says.

Opera project lead Charles Hamel believes every web browser will “eventually integrate some kind of [crypto] wallet,” allowing for a new infrastructure for the web and new business models to emerge.

The biggest browser wallets
Software firm and incubator Consensys [which funds Decrypt] has been banking on MetaMask, the primary route to accessing Ethereum-based dapps, since 2016. A mobile version is anticipated soon.

Metamask serves as a wallet for Ethereum-based tokens and also a bridge from today’s internet to the decentralized one of tomorrow. “The team is focusing on ‘not being ‘just a wallet,’ but a portal to the world of all things blockchain,” said Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, Joseph Lubin, announcing the mobile release.   

Dan Finlay, Metamask’s lead developer, cavilled a bit with the “browser-wars” metaphor, saying that Web3 is more of an open community than the old, Silicon Valley-startup-competitive days of Web1. But he agreed that a lot of the action in the coming months would center on the browser: “In the near term, the browser has proven to be one of the most secure environments on a user’s computer, and so being a browser extension has allowed our users to browse a somewhat sanitized selection of interfaces.  But eventually, it will be clear that even the browser is betraying user trust, and we will need to provide something better.”

Finlay said his team has “some increasingly specific ideas about what this means, and we’re planning to share them in the next few months, and added: “I used to think that eventually the account manager would need to be built into the operating system, but I increasingly think the account manager may actually replace the operating system as we know it today.”

For his part, Lubin told Decrypt he believes it “might end up being a competitive space. [But] it might be the case that some group builds an open source version that ends up being a standard. It is very early days, so there will be lots of opportunities for differentiation.”

Browletts also promise to simplify the convoluted onboarding process that’s been thwarting so many potential Web 3.0. users.

Crypto’s wallet makers are in position to shape the design of the gateway to the decentralized web because they are the ones with most opportunity to study all the usability challenges and security issues that arise when a browser is paired with a wallet and permanently online. Users may get hacked or have their wallets stolen.

“For security, assurance that one is connecting with the blockchain is valuable, [but] having to download a plugin for that is not optimal,” says Lubin.

The next stage of development is wallets that provide a suite of features and dapps; a wallet that will be able to perform crucial functions: proving identity, interacting with dapps, trading tokens, buying tickets, unlocking your car and logging into Facebook—all without ever leaving the app.

For these reasons, everyone is racing to build bigger, better, more versatile browletts. Coinbase, the first to develop a one, is busy finessing its product.

“One of Web3’s defining characteristics is that it builds upon today’s internet of information with a new internet of value. Just like the internet made it easy to transfer data around the world, crypto makes it easy to transfer value around the world,” says Sid Coelho-Prabhu, product lead for the Coinbase Wallet.  “That’s why we believe that the browsers of the future will make accessing your funds and using applications powered by crypto a seamless, integrated experience.”

Most of the big cryptocurrencies have their own browser wallets in production or under development. NEO, for instance, is working on the Teemo;Tron’s browser wallet, TronLink, is currently in beta and so on.

Browlett battles
The nascent wallet makers are currently ascendant, having amassed insights and experience aplenty. But don’t expect it to stay that way.

Already, huge multinationals are moving into position. Leaked photos of Samsung’s latest smartphone, the Galaxy S10 suggest it will feature a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. Samsung joins HTC and several other startups in introducing smartphones with wallets. (Browser-linked wallets are less an issue with hardware manufacturers since phone operating systems are like browsers on steroids. Manufacturers have complete control over what apps to put in their apps stores. Thus they have “ownership” of the user via what the default apps are.)

Regardless of who gets there first, the possibilities for the future are intriguing. ”Eventually, I think we will see less interactive user pull as intelligent agents do our bidding, acquiring info and items for us that they know we will be interested in,” says Lubin. “Conversational interfaces with dapps and user agents will likely be a major next interface.”

But for now, the shift to a more decentralized world, complete with autonomous intelligent agents and other mind-boggling innovations, will see browletts become critical in the scheme of things—the next stage in the battle for technical dominance.

Lubin hopes that “empowering the user and enabling fluid choice rather than [a] lock-in” will win out in the era of the decentralized web.

But if past experience is a clue, the battle will be fierce, and the prize will be a multitude of spoils.

5931,"I know most people here don't even trade, but I will tell you I've made a shit ton of money lately doing something I call *price cost averaging*. Where as Dollar Cost Averaging buys a set amount monthly (like $100 / month), with *price cost averaging* you buy based upon price of asset. So it *could* work something like this:

Take total Assets (car, 401k, equity, etc), say this is $60k.

Say you want to buy $6k BTC (10% of assets).

Now set a price range you want to buy at, let's say $3,000 to $9,000 - over the course of 1 year.

Month 1, you place the following orders:

* $5,500 @ $3,000

* $500 @ $3,500...

Month 2 (no hits):

* $5,000 @ $3,000

* $500 @ $3,500

* $500 @ $4,000

---

The advantage here is that you catch all the price swings, and have relatively little fear of price drops. In fact, you WANT *sudden and sharp* price drops, which BTC is known for.

You can do a similar reverse pattern for selling, such as:

Month 1:

$5,500 BTC @ $9,000

$500 BTC @ $8,500

And so on... again you CATCH all these wonderful price spikes and price dips.

The 2nd advantage to this is that it keeps you *actively trading* but without ANY concern whatsoever about price.  Once you set your percentages and your pricing intervals, virtually nothing else matters.

Once I started this approach I sold me 3 BTC @ $6,200. Since then, I bought 1 BTC @ $3,200, 1 BTC @ $3,400, 3 BTC @ $3,600 (not in that order)...

I had orders all 'bear market' to grab 3 BTC @ $2,700 but it never hit. I was praying for a sudden price dip, but no strikes. But I did catch both $3,200 and $3,400 spikes... those felt so good.

At the end of it, I took out cash I needed and went 'all in' at $3,600 (like 2 days ago). A cool 2 BTC + Cash profit, in just 2 months.

At this time, personally, I'm very long BTC (all in but fat cash too), but guess what? If it hits $4,400 I'll sell some BTC... and rebuy in full at $3,800... rinse and repeat every $600 or so all the way between here and $150k ;)

I have a speculative prediction I can make 30% BTC returns simply from virtually automated high-low buying, selling... but I have it setup in such a way that *if* in the low-low chance BTC hits $500k, I'm still golden.

The trick is to not think of yourself as trying to become a BTC trillionaire, but to simply settle for $1 Mil USD, without stress. IMO, you can do that easily with $40k invested in BTC today.

And if you follow the method I mention above, you can probably cash out $300k during this next bull run, and still have 6 BTC to do what the fuck ever with. Some might say that is $75k per BTC, but it's really a series of insanely small transactions, gaining you 2 or 3 BTC over the year, allowing you to sell a few guilt free... staying fat in both cash and BTC.",19-02-20-09-47,33,4539,Bitcoin1776,asgj4m

This process *only* works in highly volitile markets. If you think BTC will continue to behave as such, AND follow the generalized pricing pattern (at least doubling at the halving) then it’s pure gold - free money sonny.

The price of crypto is based almost exclusively on price speculation, so money changing hands in anticipation of future price changes. There is no theoretical way that the average gains would be larger than the average losses, it is possible for any one person to win or lose in crypto because the gains/losses are not equally distributed.

With Samsung releasing the S10 tomorrow, are we looking at a major shift by the company into crypto? Rumours have been swirling for months about Samsung but they appear to be gaining traction with a story in The Independent (UK newspaper) today.

Samsung SDS have been working away for a number of years, recently releasing details of a blockchain accelerator for payments. They are also working with IBMs Hyperledger and have developed the Nexledger blockchain.

The company are also working on ASICs and plan to move into bitcoin mining.

Cosmoschain have announced that they're the first supported dApp on the S10 - a cosmetics app where users can rate make-up and receive rewards but this could be restricted to Korea.

If Samsung Pay is integrated with the Keystore wallet we could see contactless bitcoin payments (up to $40) within a month when the phone launches...is it time to have both checking and savings accounts with bitcoin?

The Samsung conference is live from San Francisco 2/20/19, 7pm GMT. 

I agree that it'll increase stress to the network but I think segwit will negate some of the previous bottlenecks.

It's also unclear how Samsung would deal with payments (potentially keeping btc and paying fiat to the shop directly?). 

I can imagine having $100 on my phone for small purchases and replacing as I spend it. I think store of value is slowly becoming inevitable, ten years was a big psychological barrier.",19-02-20-08-58,1,7,Nactusdurrelli,asfzyz
6007,"Imagining any one event or 'shift' happening and overnight the mainstream sees bitcoin as a viable payment method sounds extremely naive to me. It will only happen after we've beaten them over the head with hundreds or maybe thousands of such events.

“BREAKING DOWN Rent-Seeking
According to Adam Smith, individuals and businesses can earn income from three sources: profit, wages and rent. Generating profit usually requires risking capital in the hope of a return while earning wages tends to be labor-intensive. Rent is the easiest and least risky type of income because it requires only resource ownership and the ability to use those resources to generate income by lending their use to others. Because rent income implies less risk or work than other types of income, individuals and companies seek to earn this income whenever possible. Rent-seeking becomes a problem when entities engage in the practice to increase their share of the economic pie without increasing the size of the pie.”

3 is simple and straightforward, zero maintenance, accounting or running costs.

1 is essentially continuously buying Bitcoin given an initial investment and running costs. At $100k scale there most likely would also be rent and commercial power connection involved. Over a long period of time this could produce more coins than if you just bought them, but there are also continuous running costs and maintenance. 

Thing to note is that mining revenue is going to drop off over time - look up the difficulty over the last years, so if your brand new miners are making X coins today, then might very well be making X/3 coins in a year. Fortunately, the ASICs are already banging against the technology limits, so massive jumps in difficulty are no longer likely, but the steady growth is not going anywhere.

Another thing to research is taxes - if you would be selling the produce of your mining to cover the costs, then taxes would apply, probably at higher rates than long term capital gains of simply buying coins.

6407,"Coinbase and other commodities exchanges often go through periods where hundreds of thousands of people start making accounts and start buying. It's more profitable to them to limit you and your purchases so that they can accumulate themselves knowing your interest in the underlying commodity. Additionally, the biggest exchanges could increase these restrictions during bubbles to artificially force buyer interest to ""dry up"" in a commodity if their holdings ever get too low. They can also increase margin trading restrictions during these times for even more of an effect and are often in touch with regulators that assist in these matters. This actually happens in the silver markets and what's really shady is that everyone knows it's happening, too.

Suppose you load up Coinbase and go to purchase and put in that you want $2k. They limit you to a $5 purchase but know you want to purchase $2k worth so they just go ahead and buy some if it knowing you are eventually going to pay for it. 

Imagine being Coinbase and being able to do this for thousands of your own customers. You could basically prepurchase what your customers are going to want without having to actually give it to them and getting a free markup when the actual trade goes through.

They tell you it's for some payment service, or international payroll or some BS to get you to cash the check, by making you think it's a legit business.

6430,"Andreas seems to place too much emphasis on Bitcoin Maximalism = Single platform or single currency worldwide which I think is absurd. I cannot think of one person who defines Maximalism in such a manner. 

Most Maximalists don't tend to suggest altcoins will dissapear, simply that they will become increasingly irrelevant because using them adds friction, costs, slippage, and risk. The reason why many fiat currencies exist is because this inefficiency is deliberately added to give local control to individual states at a cost. Whether it be loyalty points , local currencies, local fiat ... these will continue to exist and compete with BTC as it grows and eventually overtakes the USD as the reserve currency of trade and perhaps one day becomes the most stable unit of account.

Maximalists don't suggest that people should not have choice or be restricted from creating their own coin(remember with UASF many maximalists were going to create and follow a new chain even if it was a minority one.) The recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD) is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs.

Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-

1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist

2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain

3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist at least anytime soon

4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like the USD is at this time).

This is the point I am making. Many of these people that Andreas refers to that argue with him about supporting scams have the same views I present above. I know most of these people on twitter and Andreas is merely assuming their viewpoint not understanding they have similar nuanced views. 

>This crew eschews fiat currency in favor of crypto as long as it's just Bitcoin

Yes, this does not refute any of my statements. Stable fiat like USD and Euros are very useful tools in this transition period. Hopefully BTC will one day become liquid enough to be as good of a unit of account and until than it is completely reasonable to use fiat and BTC

>Vitalik is a fraud, what a scammer, etc., etc."" 

Acknowledging scam projects exist and scammers exist does not mean to suggest that we think they will disappear. People will keep gambling with altcoins and scaming each other. Altcoins will come and go(become irrelevant) as we have seen many times in the past

BTC maximalists tend to believe some altcoins are not scams like grin, ltc, monero, namecoin, and others. This does not mean they want anything to do with these altcoins. Some maximalists use and invest in these , others just want to focus on Bitcoin. There are literally only a few exceptions to this with JWW calling everything a scam but BTC , and some people like Luke calling LTC a scam (but I doubt he considers everything but BTC a scam). Most ""maximalists"" tend to simply want to focus on Bitcoin though and fall under the description I present , not the caricature that Andreas refers to.

Every economic philosophy you've listed strives to achieve a balance between its citizens' personal sovereignty vs. the ability of the power structure to maintain the status quo. None of these *philosophies* are about ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"", as you put it. However, *in practice*, there are too many ways to game each system, and as a result, those with the knowhow and/or ruthlessness will inevitably fight their way to the top of the hierarchy (and fight to stay there as long as possible). It's not that the philosophies themselves are designed to be corrupted; it's the destructive nature of human greed, and our inability to create a system that cannot be co-opted by the greedy and powerful among us.

I'm not sure if such a system would *require* an engaged and knowledgeable population (although it would certainly help), just so long as the incentives are clear/transparent, meaningful, easily enforceable, and there was some mechanism to verify consensus among all of the participants (did somebody say, ""utopia""?).

That is outrageously untrue. Implementing an expired patent is one of the safest things you can do. Implement exactly what is described in a well expired patent is pretty much the closest you can ever be to being sure that no patent covers what you are doing (because any earlier patent on it would also be expired, and any later would be invalid by virtue of the existence of the earlier patent).

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

It is using a different logo with a green B tilted the other way.

But with this symbol there is no room to look just a little bit different. It’s black and white and just using a different font or tilt won’t be enough for people to keep track of what this symbol means. They need a different symbol.

So no matter what you feel about technology and project members the expectation people have is that the B sign (which isn’t on my iPad keyboard for some reason) represents BTC.

Gold is different as it shares only the store of value component of use with Bitcoin but not the limited supply. You're missing the much MUCH bigger picture here. Once an ETF is approved, it would set in motion a public perspective of legitimacy, and the spin off effect and additional adoption that would result would dwarf the smaller issue of any manipulation enabled by the first approved ETF.

Yes governments make it hard. You have to submit ID and shit if you go with a legit exchange. If you go OTC you have to deal with scammers and reversible payment methods. Everything other than crypto or fiat cash is reversible. With cash there is the additional risk of forged notes and theft.

Buying BTC with fiat is also hard. Now you're on the other side  of the deal and have to convince the seller your reversible payment method is trustworthy. All bank based methods are reversible.

7535,"The way git works any changes to the repository needs to be committed along with a hash.  Without those commits and hash's, nothing works so they cannot just go in there and start altering code.

So, Microsoft, in theory, could override commit access on the repository and make a commit of their own to do something nefarious but a look at the changelog would show the commit.

7545,"I could interpret your query in many ways. My understanding of what you're asking, if I put it in other words, is ""why can't businesses just accept Bitcoin using a normal wallet (eg: electrum, mycelium,...) But instead they always end up resorting to solutions like coinbase commerce or bitpay?""

So the answer to that is:
1 - they can certainly do that (ie: accepting Bitcoin via a standard wallet); and
2 - it's very convenient to do that if you are a small business where you work on your own; however
3 - in larger businesses the payments are handled by salaried employees. In these cases you don't really want them to know the private keys, while you still want them to be able to accept payments from customers; and so
4 - you have solutions like coinbase commerce where few people can know the private keys, but a lot more can actually use the platform to bill clients and allow the company to get paid.

There are actually other advantages, like for instance accepting a wide variety of altcoins but settling in bitcoin.",19-02-19-12-17,3,182,roveridcoffee,as4n3j
7546,"I'm not sure how Coinbase works, but here is one way they could do it:

Coinbase might hold a merchant's bitcoins in a custodial wallet and assign the merchant a username and password. The merchant could then view their balance by typing in that username and password on the Coinbase website. Then, if another user ""sends"" that merchant bitcoins, the \*user\* might send bitcoins, but it wouldn't necessarily go directly to the merchant, because he has no address. Instead, it would go to Coinbase, who would then keep the bitcoins in their own wallet, and simply update a number on the merchant's dashboard -- without actually giving the merchant any bitcoins. In effect, the merchant would have no address to give to. Coinbase could then make further demands on the merchant, telling them (in nice language) that they will only update the merchant's balance if the bitcoins come from a Coinbase wallet, that way the merchant would have to either stop using Coinbase or put up a sign saying something like ""We only accept bitcoins from Coinbase wallets.""

To be clear, I don't think that is how Coinbase actually operates, but it's just one possible way of doing it that seems relatively easy to implement to my untrained mind.",19-02-19-12-17,1,18,nowitsalllgone,as4n3j
7547,"Because if YOU have a Coinbase wallet, that means that YOUR coins are on Coinbase's system and they can transfer the amount instantly off chain.

This, to me, strongly suggests Bitcoin in itself is some kind of beta test, as it will obviously not be sustainable after all of the blocks are mined. Its not about defeating bitcoin, its about the inevitable death of bitcoin. No one really knows what will happen when the last block is mined in a few years, the value could skyrocket or it could become worthless, or nothing at all may happen. But this currency is built on decentralization of ledgers, and if the incentive to keep ledgers (mining) is taken away, the whole system should collapse.

Cryptocurrency as a concept, however, is simply inevitable. It is a pandora's box of financial technologies. Simply a matter of time before cryptocurrency replaces Fiat currencies around the world. The hard part is creating a cryptocurrency that actually adds value to people. Bitcoin, at the end of it, was basically backed by energy the same way the USD was backed by gold. The energy required to mine it kept the value high, but since the hash function difficulty scales relatively with how much power is used to mine it, the amount of energy a bitcoin can be worth is theoretically infinite. Bitcoin is already a black hole for energy consumption. Using unlimited energy on useless equations to gain finite money is inherently unsustainable. 

The equations of a practical cryptocurrency should benefit humanity in some way, while discouraging feeding unlimited energy in a system, and have safeguards to prevent one person/entity from having too much mining capacity. A perfect cryptocurrency would be a source of small secondary income for millions of families across the world instead of the main income of crypto-mining operations.

For example, is the flexibility the Fed has in controlling the dollar a good thing or bad thing? During the 2008/09 financial crisis, a few old white men were able to get together behind closed doors and drastically increase the money supply thereby stealing purchasing power from the average citizen. Is that flexibility a good thing or bad thing? Perhaps one might argue that during that period of time if the Fed COULDN'T do that it would have resulted in a complete financial collapse, but that conveniently sidesteps the fact that those responsible for the financial crisis (unscrupulous banks) were counting on that flexibility to bail them out for their poor behavior. If they were forced to adhere to an inflexible system, would that have prevented their irresponsible behavior, thereby preventing the need to have bailed them out?

Maybe, maybe not, but nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed before. Maybe it's worth giving the rigid, inflexible system a try. It's different even to when the dollar was on the gold standard as gold can be hidden and re-hypothecated into a de facto fractional reserve system creating more paper gold IOUs than actual gold in existence because the supply of gold is hard to continually audit and easier to hide from view. An institution's supply of Bitcoin can be continually verified very easily to see if they actually have the stores they say they do.

The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (""GDPR"") is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to an enterprise established in the EEA or—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.

Controllers of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the data is not available publicly without explicit, informed consent, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information stored separately.

7941,"You need to understand the difficulty adjustment. 
There is no set “cost to mine”.

The more people mine, the more it costs to mine. 

Each miner is trying to find a hash of all the data they want in a block that comes out lower than the “target”. 

They have a variable they change over and over while trying to find this special low hash. That’s the nonce. 

Once they find the very low rare hash they create a block, get the block subsidy and tx fees of any transactions in the block they just created, other nodes verify their work, and then the race is on to make the next block. 

After 2048 blocks, the software calculates how frequently the blocks were found. If it was less than every 10 minutes, the target for a valid hash gets even lower, meaning it’s even LESS probable of finding a valid hash, meaning you have to spend more electricity to find one, meaning the cost to mine goes up. 

If the block subsidy went away, and heaps of miners shut off their equipment, (as sometimes happens) then blocks will take LONGER than 10 minutes to be created. 

Then, after 2048 blocks, the difficulty will change to make it easier to find a valid hash. If this keeps happening over time, the cost to mine keeps going down in line with the reward miners receive. 

The reason transaction fees are low now is nothing to do with what the block subsidy is. It’s just supply and demand. There’s only so many transactions that can fit into a block. If blocks are full all the time, you have to outbid other users to bribe miners into including your transaction in a block instead of someone else’s. 

With or without a block subsidy, miners will mine the highest fee transactions first almost every time. 

One day there will only be transaction fees in the block reward, no block subsidy. 
But miners will still exist, blocks will still happen every 10 minutes, and it doesn’t matter if there’s a gajillion hashes per second or just one laptop in my loungeroom mining, bitcoin will work the same. 


Now the only doom and gloom prophecy that exists is this: some people posit that if there’s not many people mining then it becomes easy to re-org the blocks. That’s when someone mines a longer chain in secret, then broadcasts their chain to the network essentially invalidating however many blocks are different in their chain to yours. 

This is why many exchanges wait 6 blocks (or confirmations) before considering a transaction safe. 

If someone sends bitcoin to an exchange, swaps it for Monero, withdraws the Monero, then does a re-org attack (also called a double spend) revealing their chain to the network which, conveniently, doesn’t include them sending any bitcoin to the exchange in the first place, they now have their bitcoin AND the Monero. 

Exchanges and massive transactions on chain are the most at risk of double spend attacks. 

But this is very easily solved, simply by waiting for more confirmations before considering a transaction final. 

Because most transactions in the future will be done on lightning anyway, as long as the channel was opened a lot of blocks back, it’s really not an issue. 

So in a nutshell: mining costs are irrelevant. The network adjusts so there’s always close to 10 minute blocks no matter how many miners there are. When the block subsidy goes away nothing will change, except maybe exchanges who don’t use lightning will have to wait more blocks before allowing withdrawals.

7942,"> can somebody point me to the literature (or just tell me here) that describes the calculations of mining costs (minus Bitcoin reward)?

That's easy, the answer is zero.  Miners will always spend up to - but not more than - 1 BTC to gain 1 BTC through mining.

Not true  
The low transaction costs are enabled by the non-mining node operators, who provide their services for free, because they are altruistic and it's cheap and easy to run a node  

Also, Bitcoin mining was a penny hobby for years after Bitcoin was launched  

Miners do not need financial incentive  
When the financial incentive falls, after the price bubble bursts or after the next (or the one after) halving, greedy miners will retire. They will be replaced by altruistic miners. Mining will cost pennies, in the same way that non-mining nodes cost pennies",19-02-19-08-29,1,87,igadjeed,as2bm8

8022,"Update on the HTC blockchain phone. Interesting, but the presenter, Michael Del Castillo, seems oddly uninformed about some crypto basics. For example, he seems to think that cold storage automatically requires a third party “cold storage facility” and that this centralizes what is supposed to be a decentralized protocol. Of course, you don’t need a third party. A thumb drive in safe-deposit box will do perfectly well. The phone/wallet itself seems to be a multi-sig arrangement, which allows trusted parties (individuals) to give the phone the permission needed to use the private key (or phone password? -- Castillo uses the two terms interchangeably at one point) that you have forgotten. He says that private keys are “very difficult to memorize” (putting it mildly) but never mentions a wallet’s word-seed and doesn’t mention if the HTC phone stores a word-seed. Word-seeds, of course, are fairly easy to memorize (if you only use one wallet, that is) -- the newest Trezor only uses twelve words as opposed to the twenty-four other wallets use. Castillo mentions software wallets but not hardware ones. What would be great is a phone that hardware wallets can plug into. (I’m not sure you can do that yet with a Trezor.)

It would be nice to see some kind of explanation for core's outright rejection of ed25519 / curve25519 for aggregated signatures.

The guys at Evernym had a solid looking proposal for [BIP32-Ed25519](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSk7PYrcrgAhUMQBoKHeo1C90QFjAAegQICRAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcardanolaunch.com%2Fassets%2FEd25519_BIP.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3OXzOReFkJcRBO9SRUw1RS) which I never really saw counter-analysis for, much less from core. I'm not a cryptographer, but it seems that their effort to maintain ed25519 compatibility in their scheme would also maintain HD wallet compatibility with aggregated signatures.

The unsettling kick to Bitcoin's nuts is that there are effectively no active counter-proposals for an ed25519 backed implementation of threshold signatures. Given that Segwit is only at 40% adoption, this latest techno-wonder from blockstream feels like 2015 all over again.

In a healthy relationship, that is not something you withhold from your partner.  Being secretive about money and going to these lengths to conceal it is not a good look in any relationship.

8418,"No offense, but that sounds like a terrible idea. Just a few issues off the top of my head:    
    
1) How would you bootstrap/enforce this currency? There would be no way to distribute it like you suggest without getting a State entity involved, and there goes the ""trustless, decentralized, censorship-resistant"" qualities (aka- the whole point of crypto/btc in the first place) out the window.    
    
2) How would you value this currency? Bitcoin's and other cryptos' value have been determined by the free market. Everyone with bitcoin had to trade it for something of value (obviously ignoring any stolen/gifted btc here). If you distribute 1 ""worldCoin"" to everyone on the planet, there is no price history to base a valuation off of. It would be nearly impossible without (again) having to bring in a State actor to enforce the value and/or ""back"" the currency with another asset or currency, which defeats the point (again).    
    
3) Forget #1 and #2 for a moment, and let's pretend everyone on the planet now has 1 of these ""worldCoins"". What are you doing with everyone's money/assets that they had before this new currency was distributed? Did we confiscate everyone's USD, precious metals, real estate, etc., and torch them, or divvy them up to the population of the world as well? If not, aren't the rich still rich and the poor still poor? Wealth isn't just a number balance in a bank account.    
    
I don't have time to list any more flaws with your argument, but that should be enough to show how impractical something like that would be. Maybe there's a counter-argument that I'm not privy to, in which case I'd be glad to hear it. Otherwise, let's abandon the whole ""evenly distributed cryptocurrency for the whole world"" notion.

8578,"I have several issues with what Varoufakis is saying here, including his whole ""blockchain not bitcoin"" bit and his assertion that bitcoin is apolitical. But I just want to focus on his association of the gold standard with the Great Depression.

The Great Depression was caused by a lending driven speculative bubble in the stock market that popped after the Fed tightened.

The existence of a gold standard made it difficult for the Fed to reinflate that bubble and their failure to do so has often been blamed for why the Great Depression was so harsh. But the existence of a gold standard did not itself initiate the depression.

2008 was very similar to the Great Depression. It was caused by a lending driven speculative bubble which popped after the Fed raised interest rates. Like with the great depression, existing laws regarding monetary policy prohibited the Fed from having enough power to reinflate the bubble---only in 2008 one could say the limitation was from a Treasury Bond standard rather than a gold standard. But unlike the Great Depression, in 2008 congress didn't hesitate to change the laws to permit the Fed more power so the Fed was able to reinflate the bubble. Their lack of hesitance was likely due in large part from the lessons supposedly learned from the Great Depression, lessons that lead people like Varoufakis to just assume the issue has been settled.

But what everyone seems to forget when talking about the Great Depression is how it was a margin driven speculative mania that lead to it in the first place, the only lesson recalled seems to have been what the Fed supposedly did wrong after the Depression began.

What led to the Great Depression was too much credit being created relative to actual increases in productive activity. That's what we mean by a lending driven bubble, the money that is being created from lending is not actually being used to fuel productive enterprise. This excess of money/credit eventually has to correct itself. When the central bank, prior to both the Great Depression and the Great Recession, noticed the bubble and took measures to reduce lending in order to temper it, they end up with the bubble popping and a subsequent recession.

The 2008 crisis has been responded to with extreme money printing from central banks, and the apparent way in which it has alleviated the recession has people championing this as vindication of lessons learned from the Great Depression. It is in this context that someone like Varoufakis can be dismissive of Bitcoin. But the problem is that this money creation has not corresponded with a coinciding increase in productive activity in the economy, leading to a massive stock market bubble. In other words, the solution that has been offered, which in the short term seems to have been vindicated, is actually creating the exact same conditions that led to the Great Depression. Should those conditions play out as they did in 1929, the narrative will completely reverse and people like Varoufakis will find it less easy to be so dismissive of hard money.

Of course, he and others will argue that the problem was due to all the stimulus having come from central bank money printing that ended up concentrated in financial markets and not deficit spending from governments on real productive endeavors. But, nevertheless, the idea of the gold standard as having been what limited central banks' ability to act will lose popularity as it becomes clear the danger in letting central banks act at all.

The truth is, no one knows with any certainty how money works, there are just prevailing theories made strong by current economic conditions. But we are living through a time when those conditions can rapidly change, and appear to want to do so, in such a way that most of the popular theories of the 20th century quickly give way.",19-02-18-22-43,4,1152,Ilogy,arwfaj

I not an expert on Ethereum, but I see it more as an evolving Infrastructure, that is still in heavy development. A high risk project, that might bring rewards in a few years. I agree that there is some messiness to the development process, but that's can easily happen when software gets developed open source, especially if the project is a moving target. Ethereum gets developed based on ongoing research. It's easier to have no mess, if there is a clear path to reach the goal from the beginning.

Proof of stake is a big deal, if it can replace or augment PoW without relevant downsides. It would be a lot more compelling to stake ether, than do ""pointless"" hash calculations that require a lot of energy, and are only worth doing in conditions with dirt cheap electricity.

Plasma and Sharding for scaling are work in progress. Some plasma implementations apparently already work.

Decentralized Exchanges are a good purpose already.

If one wanted to build a Platform to sell actual ownership of digital assets, like music, games or videos, that can be traded, and won't die when one company goes insolvent, Ethereum could be a goof platform. 

No need for Netflix, Spotify, Steam, if you can publish your content yourself, and get payed easily, minus the cost of hosting it on the network, available for as long as some interested party pays the fees or archives it.

I find these possibilities way more promising to provide actual value long term than other Blockchains.",19-02-18-14-05,0,841,Kaschnatze,arshgo
9167,"This is basically a list of every misconception in the ETH community. It sounds just like banks who are excited about their private blockchain, despite having no in depth understanding of what problem they're trying to solve. They don't know whether their proposed solution actually solves anything, or just sounds really cool.

Ethereum has had years to solve problems, and all they've done is create more.

Bitcoin at least does what it says (unseizable commodity with strictly limited supply) and solves the problem of soft money issued by central banks. It hasn't been adopted yet, but it is at least a solution. 

I don't know what problem ethereum has solved, even accounting for lack of adoption. Were we suffering from a severe lack of shitcoins? 

Eth community like to point out ""there's solutions we hadn't even thought of yet"", and that's possible but you can say the same about bitcoin, and it's not even clear any of those are unique to ethereum.",19-02-18-14-05,5,3181,jmw74,arshgo
9168,"Which aspects you consider misconceptions, and based on what information?

To me it doesn't matter what Ethereum is now, it matters what potential it has, based on its goals.

It might not be worth discussing though, as there's no way of knowing what the situation will be like in 2-3 years. Ambitious projects can fail a lot easier than simple ones, but the also have potential to be revolutionary. There's no innovation without someone doing things, while some people think he's crazy spending time doing what they can not envision. I'm not saying that Ethereum is magically great, but they are at least working on something that could be immensely useful.

To me this is not about Ethereum vs. Bitcoin either. It's okay to have different things for different needs, and as you say, Bitcoin could evolve into something more too, if they have that as a goal.

There's something good about crypto in general already though. A lot of people learned about asymmetric cryptography, who wouldn't have cared otherwise. And it has brought people together to develop something new. 

I do not worry about Shitcoins. When programming became widely available in the 80s with the first popular home computers, there was a lot of shitty programming too, by people trying what they can achieve.

Same when the Web became popular in the 90s, and ""everyone"" built their own Website for no good reason..

Same with Kickstarter a couple years ago. Among good ones there were a lot of shit projects trying something out. Altcoins are not much different.

Without trying, we can't know what is possible, so I consider it valuable.

Now, based on bitcoins short ten-year career you could argue that buying commodities and services with bitcoin is ""not fair"" because of the potential growth. 

It all depends on what your baseline is,  you and most of the world uses fiat as their baseline.

 Ex: one bitcoin = $3545

In my eyes, one bitcoin is worth one bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be printed thus there is no inflation. The value can not be undermined by mass printing as no one can create more. 

When my grandparents bought a house 60 or so years ago it cost around $30,000, when my parents went to buy a house one town over it cost close to $500,000.

9336,"In this scenario, if I offered the camera for trade for some amount of BTC and someone accepted the trade, then yes, I would honor my agreement, even if the BTC price in USD dropped a lot.  Maybe not everyone would, but I would.  I honor my agreements.  I actually think most people do. 

But this scenario is contrived.  If I want $300 for the camera, then I would price it as $300, not in BTC. If I wanted 0.1 (or whatever) BTC, I would price it that way and I wouldn't care about the USD value.  I would not price in BTC if what I want to be paid in USD.

Of course none of this changes the fact that if we enter into a trade agreement, then it is fair.  Consider another scenario.  If you buy the camera for $300,and love it.  Then a month later the store has a sale, selling the same thing for $200, was your purchase for $300 somehow unfair?   If so, why?

You'll have to wait 30 days to buy back in to avoid a wash sale (or the hassle of not knowing if wash sales will apply or not depending on what tickles the IRS's fancy). Other than that, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride where ever it goes.

As far as OP is concerned, the price is what you agree to and then your good is priced in BTC. Whatever happens in the meantime, who cares. If you bought a $50 game for $50 worth of Bitcoin, you spent $50 of value. Just because you lost out on potential future value (if the price doubles) doesn't mean you got cheated. If you thought this way, you should be eating nothing but ramen and sticking all the money you would have spent on normal food into an interest earning account, because spending it on food is obviously cheating you out of potential future profits... As an example, I budget $100 per month for eating out, but if I didn't eat out ever (because it's really not required) over 10 years, I'd have an extra $12,000 in my account (not including interest earned). That's literally a car's worth of lost opportunity. To make the analogy fit a little more, instead of spending that $100 on eating out, buy BTC with it, and then you'll have some BTC with a $12,000 cost basis at the end, which may have a value above or below your cost basis. Point is, it set you back $12,000, regardless of what it's currently priced at.

Generally, pick a price and go with it. If I'm selling a motorcycle, I'll sell it for 1.2 BTC... Whatever that happens to be in USD is irrelevant, because it gets me pretty close to what value I placed on the bike.",19-02-18-11-53,5,30,ExtraIncrease,arrat5

Do you still see that value in 1btc?  Better, do you see the value of 1btc as more or less than the market price?  If more, keep the BTC.  If less, trade for USD.  Nobody here will know how you do, or should, value 1 btc. Either action is rational/correct depending on your views.

That's quite an exaggeration. there are plenty of national currencies with far worse fluctuation.  That said, there are stable currencies and commodities, which does have a value for day-to day working capital. The problem is that there can be a large barrier to conversion to use them.

There is also a time delay, tax rate, and risk of account freeze. There are lots of barriers to fiat conversion which discourage it.

Its certainly not limited to illegal operations, as those tend to avoid bitcoin in general especially if they are large scale its too risky. Large scale illegal operations invariably involve a bank.

> This so you can balance your accounting at the end of the day and get your auditing done to pay taxes.

Tax compliance is a complex topic; some places tend to have very low compliance, so this is a non-concern for them. 

The universal concern is paying your suppliers and employees. If you can settle wages and suppliers in bitcoin, then you never need to convert to fiat. The profit that remains can easily stay in bitcoin, especially because that is the safest form of savings anyway.

Increased stability of exchange rate would go a long way towards widening the areas of the import/export chain can be settled in btc. Right now it tends to be very short hops, especially between nations without good fiat banking infrastructure, with unstable currencies, or those which have low tax compliance/enforcement.

9515,"I'm annotating Ethics of Money Production and would like to respond to the fallacy that hoarding reduces aggregate production, once I'm finished.

EDIT: Here's a relevant response from Ethics of Money Production by Jorg Guido Hulsmann.

***First***, in historical fact, deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production. Long-term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and/or countries with increasing price levels. Even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system, **empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long-run growth**.^16 

***Second***, it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions. However, this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production. Notice that, in the presence of deflationary tendencies, purchase decisions in general, and consumption in particular, does not come to a halt. For one thing, human beings act under the “constraint of the stomach.” Even the most neurotic misers, who cherish saving a penny above anything else, must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day. And all others—that is, the great majority of the population— will by and large buy just as many consumers’ goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment. Even though they expect prices to decline ever further, they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later (economists call this “time preference”). In actual fact, then, consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment. **And this marginal reduction of consumer spending, far from impairing aggregate production, will rather tend to increase it**. The simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved; that is, they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment.

***Third***, it is correct that deflation—especially unanticipated deflation—makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. In the case of a massive deflation shock, widespread bankruptcy might result. Such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms, factories, and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits. However, from the aggregate (social) point of view, it does not matter who controls the existing resources. What matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used. Now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically. It merely diminishes their monetary value, which is why their present owners go bankrupt. **Thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners.** The net impact on production is likely to be zero.

***Fourth***, it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry, because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks. However, for the same reasons that we just discussed, while this might be devastating for some banks, it is not so for society as a whole. **The crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources; it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed**. It follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources; it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land, factories, streets, and so on. In the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present-day monetary authorities. Deflation certainly has much disruptive potential. However, as will become even more obvious in the following chapters, it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply. It reduces the wealth of fractional-reserve banks, and their customers— debt-ridden governments, entrepreneurs, and consumers. But as we have argued, such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment. The destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often “creative destruction” in the Schumpeterian sense^18.

For one thing, human beings act under the “constraint of the stomach.” Even the most neurotic misers, who cherish saving a penny above anything else, must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day. And all others—that is, the great majority of the population— will by and large buy just as many consumers’ goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment. Even though they expect prices to decline ever further, they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later (economists call this “time preference”). In actual fact, then, consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment. **And this marginal reduction of consumer spending, far from impairing aggregate production, will rather tend to increase it**. The simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved; that is, they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment.",19-02-18-08-00,1,3361,lobt,arp02s

In North America, I'm seeing that the banks are deciding the direction of new credit. An overwhelming majority of that credit is being used to speculate on transferring ownership of existing assets rather than for new productivity, necessarily driving prices of assets up and up.

Now if 1000 people, 500 couples, give birth to 500 children, if the currency is scarce, what will happen is that as they enter labor age, prices will decrease and wages in general too, but an increased quantity of items can be made and maybe a new technology was developed and there would be more people competing for the yields. This means that a higher population has more wealth, not surprising. In our closed city, how the prices of eggs doubling would increases anyone's standard of living? The standard of living depends on production and production is affected by bubbles when the currency inflates and leads to bad investments, the standard of living has nothing to do with the deflation. The currency could inflate 10% per day or deflate 3% per day REGULARLY, as long as the adjustments were made to prices via indexation, nothing would be harmed and it wouldn't be as good as a currency that doesn't change its supply because of the inconvenience of adjusting the prices.

Crypto is great and has its uses. CC's with fee's that provide excellent rewards that can be easily abused are also fantastic and should be used by anyone with half a brain who can keep track of a credit card statement and read and understand a ToS.

As for the article and comparing its points to CC's:

1. I don't care if people use my cards in an unauthorized way. Why? I get the money back. Very little questions asked. Hell, the credit card companies don't care nor do the vendors that have stolen cards run through them. No one cares until its obvious that the cardholder is in on it.


2. No one cares. Literally. No one.


3. Waiting periods are minimal. A dew days tops. If that's important to you than by all means go to a BTC ATM and lose your ass on fees for that purchase you have to make immediately using BTC.


4. This is a joke. I have several business cards. I don't own any businesses. Whats my business called? Well it's my name. And what do I do? I consult, I guess. They never ask why sort of consulting. Thank you Chase Business and related cards for flying my family for free across the country a few times. Since I'm a US citizen the other mentioned benefits don't serve me.


5. No one cares. People say they do. If you own a smart phone and care you need to put that in the trash barrel outside ASAP. Advertisers will stop with your info when the trash truck comes by and crushes it into the back of the truck. That ships sailed and it's something we will never see again in our lifetime (privacy).


6.   The real word just uses money orders from banks via 2 trusted parties. If one party plays fuck fuck games see you in court. In crypto land if you do a peer-to-peer transfer with your drug dealer and he rips you off you're now 100% fucked. Want to get robbed? Pay a stranger in crypto.


7. All the fee's charged by my CC's are passed onto the merchant for the same total cost as a cash transaction. It's actually illegal in my state to attempt to sway people away from using a CC and it's also illegal to charge a fee to the customer for CC use. Not my problem.

Some states (like mine) stop surcharges for CC use. Federal law also allows businesses to offer cash discounts for purchases. These discounts need to be marked planly and openly.

We're taking decades upon decades, but if Bitcoin becomes as easy to manipulate and move around as we all want it to be, it'll be just like handling cash. Could your hot wallet get stolen from your person? Sure, but so could your current wallet with cash. CCs have the advantage here, but when merchants get left with no product & no money (from a chargeback), they'll be looking for something more secure. The security of confirmed ownership of Bitcoin might be worth a discount over the 90-120+ day of ""is this or that customer going to chargeback their purchase and steal money out of my account?""

Unless those dollars become worthless...

I know you already said in another comment that you're a ""*trader that has no emotional attachment to the product*"", but I think you're missing the point that it's not about *emotional attachment* but rather the (obvious in many people's views) idea that debt-based fiat currencies are bound to catastrophically fail and we are very close to that point.

With that in mind, ""profits"" in these fiat currencies are a short-term gamble as to whether or not you can realise them back in to *real money* (e.g. Bitcoin) at a gain rather than a loss when measured in that real money.

In other words: it doesn't matter if you make $100k by selling your BTC if you only end up rebuying less BTC later as it rapidly approaches the point that $100k can't even get you a hamburger.

Or to perhaps turn around that other comment that you made and ask it back to you as a question: *I have no emotional attachment to the dollar or any other debt-based fiat currency, do you?*

(just to be clear: I am aware that there are traders who are doing so in order to increase their BTC position rather than their fiat position.  I have no problem with that concept; I just don't do it because I consider trading to be something very akin to gambling which I prefer to avoid in my life since I don't think I'm very good at it at.)",19-02-18-07-02,4,1611,dalebewan,arodq0

the last bullrun was the opening of cryptos to mainstream recognition (everybody was talking about) - it was huge because everyone wanted to be a part of the lambo community...now time has a little bit changed - people (without technical knowledge) are aware of spending lots of money into Btc and others because most traders got burnt last year...another point is that the „dreaming sequence“ ended with the start of the big crash in jan 18 (people now know about pros and cons)...the next bull run will be based on adoption and real use cases (maybe not bitcoin - we don’t know yet) rather then dreaming of big gains which will be more likely a steady and slow increase of Btc price (if at all) ...

The key to decrypt the additional seedword is based on a kind of cipher (example: First letter of every paragraph from a particular chapter of a book).

You communicate this cipher method \*verbally\* to your heirs.  Actually walk them through the entire process, but use a different book/key, to make sure they remember and know how to derive the key.

In a safe deposit box, only accessible to your heirs upon your death based on a trust you have set up, store the key to the cipher (in this example, the name of the book and chapter).

9842,"I suggest writing them down on the back of a piece of artwork or framed photo. This way you’ll remember where it is and you could leave a message to your family to open the frame. It’s better than using a journal or a random piece of paper. 

To further secure it you can do a basic multisig where (in the case of a 12 word mnemonic) you break it down into 3rds and write 8 words (1+2, 1+3, 2+3) on the back of three pieces photos and then keep one and give the other two to people you trust. This way it takes two of these places to recover your wallet.

For example, either use like in Glacier described, simple Bitcoin private keys. I personally think, that software like Electrum will be around for pretty much ever too, so I'd use that instead.

If an channel partner steps out of the boundaries of this contract, the other partner can and will enforce it by settling it on the blockchain 


This contract is basically so safe that a channel partner willingly will forward the payment to other partners for a very small fee. LN is a protocol for facilitating that. ",19-02-18-03-50,11,215,vegarde,armauk

9902,Basically the wallet knows what keys it has and scans the blocks and unconfirmed transactions from the mempool as they come in. Initially it does have to scan the blockchain. That's what the bitcoin core wallet does anyway. Spv wallets use a bloom filter to tell the full node they're connected too approximately what addresses they're interested in without telling them the exact addresses. It could also be that some wallets just call a centralised explorer type service that tracks every transaction by address for fast querying. And just look up the exact addresses they want. That's the worst way for privacy since it allows the service to know what keys are part of the same wallet.,19-02-18-03-40,4,1,Ihgggghvvb,arm777
9903,"> Wallets like Samourai find your ""balance"" in like 30 seconds after entering your HD seed.

It possible to index the entire blockchain by address. So for any given address you can find out if it has ever been used before. Since HD wallets are required to use indexes in order,  you can pretty much instantly tell if there is a balance or not.",19-02-18-03-40,2,735,rinko001,arm777
9904,"> don't you have to scan the entire blockchain checking for anything matching one of your ~~pub keys~~ addresses?

Yes you do, and it takes days  
Good wallets scan the Blockchain once, build a UTXO database, a transaction index and an address index  
Every time a new block is created these database and indexes are updated  
Your wallet is instantly able to look up the address index  
30 seconds is very slow, it must be connecting to some other wallet's UTXO database and indexes",19-02-18-03-40,2,87,igadjeed,arm777

9906,"So it can be summarized as 3 methods?

1. Full blockchain scan which is slow

2. Bloom filter query for SPV wallets

3. Simple query to third party UXTO db

9909,Most wallets use method #3.,19-02-18-03-40,2,3058,jtoomim,arm777
9910,"The number two option is more similar to number 1 - basically the spv wallets still download all the blocks and scan them but the blocks are stripped to just the header and transactions that match the bloom filter so it's still kind of slow... On the other hand I think electrum maybe does do queries like you suggested to the electrum server component. But normal full nodes don't have the ability to search for stuff other than by block id. 

3) I'm not sure - but you're probably right

9911,"afaict, samourai spies on all wallets by default, yes.",19-02-18-03-40,2,735,rinko001,arm777
9912,"Right, and wrong  
If you're using a lightweight wallet, it is accessing a full Bitcoin node somewhere else  
If you run your own full node, you have your own copy of the UTXO database, and indexes",19-02-18-03-40,2,87,igadjeed,arm777
9913,"It probably works in a very similar way to normal lightning transactions. Routing lightning payments involves hashed time locked contracts, they just don’t get published to the chain under normal circumstances. Each node in the route sets up HTLC’s with the nodes before and after them in the chain. The point of an HTLC is that if a hash preimage is revealed within the time lock time, then the transaction is successful. The receiving node is the only node to know the preimage initially. After all the HTLCs are setup the receiving node reveals the preimage to the previous node. Then that node reveals the preimage to the next one and so on. 

Thus, I would guess that for submarine swaps, they are basically just another HTLC in the chain. The transaction is published, but the next person in the chain can only receive the funds if the preimage is revealed. If the preimage isn’t revealed within the allotted time then the original owner can reclaim the funds. 

So it works exactly like a lightning payment in terms of the type of Bitcoin script used, it’s just that the submarine part is always published to the blockchain instead of just existing in state channels.

Or I could be wrong and they actually found an even more clever and efficient way of doing it, but the method I described would work and would be completely trustless.",19-02-18-03-16,1,249,TheSultanOfSwagger,arlyui

A draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for it [has been written](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki#Test\_Vectors\_and\_Reference\_Code), and you can track proposed changes to the draft on [this page](https://github.com/sipa/bips/pulls). The BIP includes an example of a pure python implementation of Schnorr signatures that passes all the test vectors for bitcoin. This will be necessary for the Electrum network, because Electrum-based wallets are typically written in python. There are also test-passing implementations in [javascript](https://github.com/guggero/bip-schnorr) and in [Go](https://github.com/hbakhtiyor/schnorr/). The javascript implementation will be necessary for most web wallets and many mobile wallets, and the Go implementation will be necessary for LND, which is written in Go.

Before Schnorr can be merged into Bitcoin Core we'll need an implementation in C++, which is the language that Bitcoin Core is written in, and that implementation will need time for testing, feedback, improvement, and deployment on the testnet. Moreover, once Schnorr signatures are added in Bitcoin Core, it will take time for other parties in the ecosystem to upgrade, especially exchanges and other wallets, which do not always use the code in Bitcoin Core. Even after the changes in Bitcoin Core have attained consensus, many exchanges and other wallets will upgrade to the ""new"" Bitcoin Core but won't immediately make Schnorr signatures available for general use, because it will take time to upgrade their systems. They'll likely have to be pressured by users and competitors to do so.

Even once they make Schnorr signatures available, it will take their engineers time to utilize its benefits, such as signature aggregation, and time to help people get used to patiently waiting for batch transactions to be broadcast. Instant transactions will still be available through lightning, but we want people to use batch transactions if they're not using lightning; you'll also be able to pay for onchain space without waiting for a batch, of course, but batching will be so much cheaper.

So signature aggregation requires Schnorr, but it is an independent protocol that Bitcoin Core doesn't need to implement, and probably won't. Bitcoin Core will still happily verify aggregated signatures, since they cannot be distinguished from other signatures.

Schnorr is implemented in [PR 558](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558) for libsecp256k1.

MuSig is implemented in libsecp256k1-zkp (a fork of libsecp256k1 with zero knowledge features for the Elements project), and Poelstra just sent a pull request regarding some [documentation for MuSig](https://github.com/apoelstra/secp256k1-mw/blob/2019-02-musig-docs/src/modules/musig/musig.md).",19-02-17-22-40,3,9302,ysangkok,arjtuh

10015,"I think that is wrong. It is my understanding that the moment Schnorr is in the majority of economically-relevant Bitcoin Core nodes, it will be *possible* to construct aggregated-signature multisig transactions without any risk.

I really like reading comments like this. They are much more encouraging than the inverse ""omglol ethereum is going so much faster, bitcoin is dead!"" comments that seem to be more common.

My view is not that things are speeding up. Eventually I expect we will wind up at the many-year or even multi-decade development cycle common to standards bodies or large banks. But for now the industry is young and somewhat flexible and we have room to make some fairly dramatic changes. Schnorr has been something we've talked about for many years, and the last year in particular has seen constant and sustained development to ensure that it was something we could deploy in a robust manner. Migration difficulty, and risk (actual and perceived) are things that we take really seriously in the Bitcoin space, even though compared to other high-assurance industries things must look pretty reckless. This reflects the fact that Bitcoin is a very new technology and there are still a lot of high-impact things that we're discovering to be possible.

The code changes required to validate Schnorr signatures, i.e. to run a full node after a Schnorr-enabling softfork, are very small.

The additional wallet changes for ordinary (single-signer) users to use the new signatures are even smaller, assuming they've done the migration work to Segwit addresses.

The real engineering difficulty is for people who want to use the new capabilities that Schnorr enables, such as compact multisignatures or adaptor signatures. I expect this will be slow, but there's a significant incentive to use these because they enable significantly more compact multisignature transactions, and for large multisignatures this could even be the difference between ""possible"" and ""impossible"".",19-02-17-22-40,3,287,andytoshi,arjtuh
10017,"> Without a corresponding rethink on how do they do back-end development, we consumers will always be waiting longer that we'd like.

Or maybe we'll get better at building competitors quickly. For example, if the devs at Wasabi and Joinmarket don't quickly implement Schnorr, I wouldn't be surprised if other people fork their projects (since they're open source), implement it themselves, and release ""Joinmarket Schnorr"" and ""Wasabi Schnorr.""

I bring up those two examples because coinjoin services are one of the areas where I am most excited about the Schnorr upgrade. Once they work with Schnorr, wallets like Wasabi and Joinmarket will be massively cheaper than their competitors, and it will make it profitable to become a liquidity provider on their markets. I imagine we'll see wallets proliferate with the option to earn bitcoins while helping improve its fungibility, all without needing to trust anyone or put yourself at risk.

This being said we may as well hardfork much earlier than this with all the hard fork wish list items well tested and a permanent scaling solution like a version of flex blocks

10040,"From a technical perspective, I would want to see bitcoin in a clear objective uptrend before putting my money in. While I am a believer in long term bitcoin, this bear market will probably play out longer than most people are anticipating. Trying to buy the very bottom of a market cycle is risky and the opportunity cost is too high when there are many other opportunities in other markets to make money

and shorting bitcoin is a pretty risky business especially after it has moved this low, the risk:reward ratio is no longer very attractive for shorting bitcoin unless it break down into new lows. 

I'd look for bitcoin to go below 2500 with a technical Buy signal, and then follow up with a higher low, THEN I would buy bitcoin for a long term holding position. Otherwise I will continue to patiently wait 

I wanted to share this perspective because I know there are lots of people who want to make money playing bitcoin but don't have experience in markets, this is a dangerous area to long OR short bitcoin.

Moreso it encourages corporate spending, rather than hoarding.

FED and central banks have limited influence when we reach such extreme situations like this one. the real problem is the ending of work as the central point of human organization. until that is tackled we will be patching the economy resulting in an overall decrease in purchasing power and quality of living like we have been having for at least 10 years. just my 10 cents of bitcoins",19-02-17-19-55,1,4,bluexip,arivj5

I'm sure you could find better ways of earning 500 dollars over 5 years. This is the reason why money is printed out of thin air. Banks only need 10% of the money they are lending if my recollection is good. So they can make 5000 dollars with the same savings. People who think bitcoin is going to make lending cheaper are delusional as far as I am concerned. They do not understand the role of currencies as a tool in macroeconomics.

bitcoin is the opposite sort of pressure on an economy. inflation pressures one to spend immediately, because the value of their money is evaporating. people buy whatever, just to avoid losing value. on the other hand, deflation pressures one to save, to only spend when they really have to or find something really great. an artificial spend pressure on an economy will make it go faster but an artificial saving pressure on an economy will make it build better things.",19-02-17-19-55,2,12282,Polycephal_Lee,arivj5

I agree that inflation is not necessarily a bad thing. If new credit was created to fund productive projects and worthwhile ventures, you could get near-stable prices in an economy. But who gets to decide what projects are worthwhile? Value is subjective - I doubt that any country can ever achieve meaningful consensus on where newly created credit is directed. 

In North America, I'm seeing that the banks are deciding the direction of new credit. An overwhelming majority of that credit is being used to speculate on transferring existing assets rather than for new productivity, necessarily driving prices of assets up and up. The people that position themselves closest to the source of credit creation will benefit the most first (happens to be the FIRE sectors), and the people furthest away suffer.

10238,"> And forcing people to buy things they actually don't need now is a sound monetary concept

You're kind of misrepresenting this.

No one is forcing you to buy things you don't need, but people are incentivized to shift their savings from cash to investment vehicles. This could be anything from bitcoin, to gold, to property, to a new lawnmower, to investing in a new startup, to stocks.

The cumulative effect would primarily be targeting the most wealthy people and corporations who hoard untold of amounts of money that could be used to elevate the economy, create jobs, and boost growth.

This isn't conjecture or theory this is how the economy functions. It has been like this for a long time. The way we incentivize or punish spending highs or lows is to adjust inflation rates. But due to so many recessions many economies have VERY low interest rates that can't be cut any more. So when a recession occurs they are basically fucked.

The proposed solution is negative interest rates here. It's not about ""sound monetary concept"" we're talking about objective economic fact here. I don't really understand the basis for which you disagree with how reality functions.

I'm not arguing whether the current system is working, perfect or a good thing. Nor am I arguing that the proposed solution in this study is bad or good. What I am saying is that under the current economic system we live in there is a problem, and the proposed solution makes sense. Plus the way it has been presented is being misunderstood and misrepresented by people in this thread.

> You sound like Keynes with his broken window theory

Not sure where you got this from but Keynes has no ""broken window theory"".

Frederick Bastiat coined the broken window fallacy in the 19th century. The argument is that if a criminal breaks the window of a storekeeper, the repairs for the window would not provide any benefit to the overall economy because it removes money he could have spent on something else.. like a new jacket. I am aware that some libertarian, uneducated types sometimes use this to attack Keynesian economic theory in suggesting that government spending has no net positive effect on an economy because it is taking money that could have been spent privately.

I've just never encountered anyone that would seriously use this argument, online or otherwise since it is - by every measurable way - false.

It relies on the following assumptions

* The economy has full employment: only under full employment does is aggregate spending constant, and equal to the full employment level of aggregate output.
* All earnings must be spent: For full employment to be sustained, all earnings must be spent. Otherwise there will be a recession.

So lets make this simple for you. Going back to the baker example, if the baker had not spent his money to fix his window, he MIGHT have spent it on something like a jacket but in reality this is very much not the case. He may have decided that he will hold onto his money under the expectation that there could be harder economic times ahead. This means that breaking and fixing the window **would have had a net positive on the economy**. Similarly, the way government taxes and spends money does the same. This is irrefutable and proven by real world and hypothetical economic studies over and over. What you are citing is a complete misunderstanding of basic economic principles. it is not a ""mysterious multiplier"" not sure who told you that.

> So if we are all wasting our money to buy piles of chewing gum is the economy then saved?

The article points out that in order to effectively roll out such a concept as (negative interest rates) which they suggest would help combat recessionary drops and improve the economy in a variety of others ways is difficult. One possible solution proposed is the implementation of a dual currency system.

The reason for this is because if banks charged negative interest people just would keep their cash under their pillows. Since why incur that charge?

They suggest that let's say the USA wants to implement this new system. They would first start by creating two types of ""physical"" currency, cash and a second category ""e-money"". The e-money would have the benefit of having the negative interest rate built in to make it simpler for people.

And to combat people hoarding their cash to avoid negative interest rates they would make it so that the cost of goods would have 2 prices. One for cash, and one for e-currency. Since the hypothetical e-currency would be adjusted for interest rate it would come 1:1. Where as the price for goods or services in CASH would be 1:0.97 for the first year and every year following would reduce in value accordingly to compensate for the cost of negative interest when the hypothetical shopowner deposited that money into a bank.",19-02-17-19-55,0,5677,Cmikhow,arivj5

What? Generally you use ""suffice to say"" to follow up an argument. ""X is adequate evidence that Y is true"". You just said ""you're so wrong, suffice to say inflation of the money supply is **always wrong**.""

You haven't provided any evidence, or argument to say why it is **always wrong**. Let us try a bit harder than this.

> is always a stealth tax on savers

By definition? No.

A tax is a fee charged by the state that is compulsory for the contribution of state revenue levied onto wages, profits, and the purchase of goods and services.

If inflation went up 100000% today, and I had 10,000$ in savings. I would not face any type of compulsory contribution to state revenue. I could leave my money in the bank and would incur zero penalty, or threat by force or otherwise to take that money.

If inflation went up I would have an incentive to spend that money, but calling it a ""Stealth tax"" is a bit of a rhetorical and ideological reach. I'll entertain your view though.

Does the intentional compression of inflation, or reduction of inflation amount to a stealth tax credit? By your line of reasoning this would be so. However, we as rationale people can clearly look at that statement and evaluate it as false.

So I think your claim here is more ideological than rooted in any type of empirical or rationale truth. But I'm open to hear you explain it more.

Geometric progression is a set of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous one with a fixed non zero number called the common ratio.

For instance, 2, 6, 18, 54... this sequence has a geometric progression ratio of *3*.

Oh neat. A quote.

The quote is criticizing the economic model of the tim, and direction. I happen to agree with what Henry says here, but he makes no statement here that disproves anything in my post or argument. Nor does he say anything that inherently rejects the proposed solution of negative interest rates which this OP is about.

I'll respond anyways because I like Hazlitt. Hazlitt was a lifelong critic of state manipulated inflation rates, especially through interest rates. And I agree with him on many points.

He identified many flaws in our economic model that are prevalent today, I happen to the feel the same way.

But what you're trying to argue are ideological problems with our overarching economic system.

It is like if I asked you if you wanted to go to the corner store for some candy. I suggested that we could drive as it would be quicker. Our third friend says, why don't we bike because it's fast too but we'd save money on gas and it isn't that much slower.

After debating we approach you for your thoughts on the matter, how should we get to the store? Bike or car? You just flat out disagree.

You aren't opposed to going to the store, or using a method of travel suggested, you haven't suggested walking, or even called for delivery.

You are insisting that the best way to get there would be to use a teleportation machine which would be instant and cost nothing. While in theory you're not wrong, we happen to live in reality where this isn't possible and your solution or criticisms are not relevant to the discussion. You're just applying a nirvana fallacy, and refusing to engage the actual discourse.

Just because teleportation would be faster, doesn't mean that my suggestion that taking a car would be optimal is WRONG. It is still factually true, even if there are other alternatives that have their own benefits and drawbacks we could discuss.

The point of creating jobs is to increase productivity, wealth and spending in a society.

> ""to devalue cash in your pocket to make negative interest rates work""

The plan isn't to nefariously try and deflate the value of money people have access to. The plan very well stated.

Basically interest rates were often very high, 15-20% range. After recession followed recession the traditional solution has been to dramatically cut interest rates to weather the storm. But we are in a place today where interest rates are VERY low. Even after we weathered 2008, interest rates remain at dangerously low levels. The obvious problem with this is that when another recession occurs, the traditional solution to cut interest rates will not be available since conventional knowledge is you can't have lower than 0% inflation.

This is because if banks charged you for depositing money to spur spending no one would use banks.

This is simply false and you can't predict this.

For one, most goods can't be purchased with bitcoin so in order to skirt this measure you'd need to leave your funds in Bitcoin.

While this could hypothetical benefit bitcoin, you and mainly other commenters have overstated that affect. The value of bitcoin would not inherently change. It would be no more valuable or reliable than any other haven (such as gold) to stash money in, which would also be shielded from the negative interest rate affects.

It is also conceivable that any government looking to implement such a measure would look for ways to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in order to skirt the negative inflation. That could mean any number of things.

Ultimately it's impossible to say how this could affect bitcoin and no country has even begun to consider such a measure. No one is proposing the implementation and while it is an interesting study it is far from what the title alludes (evidenced by some of the responses) some kind of mass conspiracy by the IMF to steal our wealth.

The problem with Keynesian theories is always that it favors the short term benefits over the long term effects. 
Of course studies will always tell that government, etc. spending is making the overall economy grow but it damages the economy in the long run if it's artificial and until you would see the negative effects there is always the next govt. spending. (The result is what the left always call the turbo capitalism in which for every problem there is just created more debt and the stock markets are being flood by all the pension funds.) In general the economy isn't an area on which studies are particularly meaningful because the enormous numbers of variables always allow different interpretations. 

Regarding your baker example: the mistake lies in the assumption that everybody has to spend their money as fast as possible to keep the economy grow/healthy. This assumptions are the same Mr. Silvio Gesell had. But this is not true. Everybody has to spend their money exactly when they want to spend it not when you or Keynes want it to be spent. Even if the baker had chosen to keep his money. 1) at some points the money will be spent and maybe this would have been a much wiser investment. 2) even if the money never gets spent it has an effect: all the money held increases the value of the money which is circulating. 
Money holding vs. money spending is what determines the value of money. It's an essential part of the free market. If the future is uncertain people tend to hold on to their money which makes goods cheaper.

Economic growth is also not only a bigger GDP. A bigger GDP means nothing as it is calculated because it adds credit-financed govt. spending. At least in my country.

The study of economics is essentially the study of incentives. Which is, in my view and most rationale people, markedly different than force.

So let's look at it another way. If negative interest rates are FORCING you to spend money, then logic would dictate positive interest rates are FORCING you to save money? Is that a view you hold as well?

The original study is essentially advocating for deflation by using negative interest rates.

No one said what you are claiming they said. If the value of money goes down, then the cost of goods will also go down. So instead of holding onto money, which is losing value, the idea is you turn that money into something different like property which will be available for a low cost and likely increase in value substantially during the same period.

In general, as interest rates are reduced, more people are able to borrow more money. The result is that consumers have more money to spend, causing the economy to grow and inflation to increase. The opposite holds true for rising interest rates. As interest rates are increased, consumers tend to save as returns from savings are higher. With less disposable income being spent as a result of the increase in the interest rate, the economy slows and inflation decreases.


Under a system of fractional-reserve banking, interest rates and inflation tend to be inversely correlated. This relationship forms one of the central tenets of contemporary monetary policy: central banks manipulate short-term interest rates to affect the rate of inflation in the economy.

Do you consider it a good thing that people continue to waste their time and labor on useless pyramid activities?  

>There would suddenly be a slew of unemployed people who would be unable to feed themselves and care for their families.
I agree with you that these things would happen, but consider these to be a very good thing.  Would you consider it better for these pyramid workers to cease their work but still continue to be paid?  Would that be better than continuing things as is?  The pyramids are of no value and this way there would be fewer injuries and those people would be able to spend time with their families instead of working in the pyramid industry.

> They wouldn’t be able to pay their mortgages or debts and would see mass defaults.

What about the workers of other productive industries who are struggling to pay their mortgages & debts because part of their earnings are being siphoned off through taxation to pay for building and tearing down pyramids?  What about all other industries that have to pay more for brick and labor because that society has the pyramid industry competing for those limited resources and driving the prices up.

>The banks would suffer and the economy would experience a domino effect of pain. For instance the local restaurants and businesses that used to make good money selling goods and services to the people building and tearing down useless pyramids would also begin to suffer and potentially go out of business. The suppliers of machinery and materials used to build the useless pyramids would lose money and potentially go out of business as well.

I again agree with you that this would happen.  I would consider those to be part of the pyramid industry.  Imagine that industries exist on a spectrum with pyramid building on one side, and productive non-pyramid industry on the other.  There are many companies that exist in between, such as a restaurant near the pyramids whose business is 80% pyramid workers and 20% other, perhaps there are suppliers of machinery that have a 60/40 split, and others that have a 20/80 split.  A sudden stop to the pyramid waste would be like a fire starting with the pyramids but also spreading to those with high economic propinquity to that activity—that is, business whose business model & revenue is dependent on the pyramid boondoggle would be more severely burned than those that are more distant.  I think we are in agreement that the activity that is most productive would continue—that is the owners of the farming or fishing business are going to continue.

>More jobs would be lost, more businesses would be hurt, and so on and so on.

Businesses would be hurt in proportion to their exposure to the pyramid industry.  The fishing and farming business would suddenly see a sharp decline in their cost of labor.  The price of stones would fall precipitously.  Factories that have been producing a pyramid construction and demolition equipment will suddenly have a strong incentive to fill that market void with farm and fishing equipment. That is, they along with individual providers of labor, as well as the economy as a whole would be shifting their resources to more productive uses.  There would be pain as is the case with change, but the alternative of persistence of the ongoing waste of resources & labor is much worse.  In addition to the pain the disruption would free up resources and allow industries that are productive and distant from those dominated by Big Pyramid to expand.  You see the pain of disruption but not the opportunity for growth due to the abundance of resources that suddenly appear from the elimination of waste.

>There would be people kicked out of their homes for defaulting on mortgages, people including children would be homeless. 
The result would be that the influx of supply for homes would suddenly drive he value of all homes downwards hurting everyone who owned a home or property.

You are simultaneously claiming that people cannot afford their home mortgages but also that home prices would fall.  Both of these would occur.  There may be foreclosures and a shift from those who do not having savings and are thus ill-prepared for economic disruption to those who do have savings and are prepared to purchase these homes at distressed prices.  The houses would be a wasted resource if they were uninhabited, thus the market will drive people to make the most productive use of those homes. 

>All these losses would also cause the govt to suffer a decrease in tax revenue, which would mean they’d have to incur more debt or cut services which would cause for more pain across those employed by the govt and potentially more cuts.

This is a good thing.  The government was using tax revenue to build and destroy pyramids over and over, so perhaps they are not the best stewards of capital.  Government services that are essential will be prioritized over wasteful nonsense.  Hard choices will have to be made, but this is far better than not making those choices and continuing to waste resources on things like pyramids and pyramid regulation.

>Since so many people were now unemployed the competition for very few jobs remaining would skyrocket, which would drive wages and working conditions downwards too worsening conditions for people.

Which means...labor cost would fall AND there would be plenty of low cost labor for the productive farming and fishing industries to expand.  With low cost of labor and cheap resources, you would have some of the farming and fishing companies experience massive growth.  The Keynesian would see GDP falling and people out of work, but what is really happening is the economy is healing, adjusting, and becoming more productive.  You see, Keynesians do not care only about spending or economic activity in the aggregate.  There is not even a thought given to the quality of that economic activity or whether it is wasteful or not.  In this hypothetical aggregate GDP falls, but the portion of that GDP that remains is of higher quality and more productive—and that portion now has the resources freed up from the pyramids that it can use to grow.

>Then people would have to dig into what little savings they had to stay afloat siphoning more money from economy.

And economic power would shift to those who do have savings.  This is an illustration of the importance of savings, as a person, company, or even a whole economy with higher savings is better able to absorb unexpected economic disruption than one with low savings.

>This is more or less what happened in 2008. The stock market tanked the value of the dollar went down people’s savings were wiped out. 

The value of USD actually increased significantly in 2008 as people fled to “safe” cash.

>you had some hypothetical way to transition those people into “useful” jobs after that transition phase things might stabilise but the mass of job losses would cause for heavy losses on the economy, and without guarantee things would even be better off.

Suppose there are two closed identical pyramid producing islands.  On one island, you allow people to keep building pryamids that are paid for by taxes on the fishing and farming industries; perhaps you *slowly* draw down the pyramid industry, but this moves at the pace of government as you have pyramid-lobbying groups spring up that spout the need of continuing to build and destroy the pyramids.  On the other island, I end the practice right away and many people are suddenly unemployed, forced out of their homes, and have to rely on charity while they frantically search for the jobs of the growing farm and fish industry.  Perhaps some even start new industries out of their desperation.  Perhaps many of these fail but those that are productive are able to pull in the investment and capital freed up from the pyramid elimination and start to thrive.  Which island do you think will be better off in 10 years?

10570,"Those are all very difficult engineering questions and we'll probably see several different implementations that try different answers. One method would be:

- When a lightning wallet produces onchain addresses, use BIP21 with a new ""lightning"" parameter so that it also puts an optional lightning invoice after the onchain address. BIP21 is already in use on the network so this would be backward compatible with existing wallets. If the sending wallet recognizes the lightning invoice, it will use that instead of the onchain address; if it doesn't recognize the lightning invoice, it will ignore it and use the onchain address instead
- Ensure that all onchain addresses produced by a lightning wallet are actually lightning channel addresses which specify how much to send to them. That way, the user doesn't have to worry about opening new channels; every time they receive onchain bitcoins the wallet either opens a new channel or adds them to an existing channel
- When sending an onchain payment, either use the ""Splice Out"" feature (which hasn't been coded up yet) to send funds out of a channel without closing it, or use decentralized swap technology so that someone else on the network trustlessly sends an onchain transaction for you and you trustlessly reimburse them with a lightning payment (trustless outbound swap technology ALSO hasn't been coded up yet)
- Have one special exception to the ""only use lightning channel addresses"" rule. Specifically, if a user wants to put an address out there without knowing how much people will send to it (e.g. if it's for donations on a webpage), have a special button for producing such addresses -- because they should not be lightning channel addresses -- and create them using BIP21 with a ""Sphinx"" parameter, allowing wallets which recognize ""Sphinx send"" to ""push"" lightning payments to your lightning node, and otherwise to ignore it and use the non-lightning onchain address.

10572,"Neutrino isn't all roses yet. It still has this huge downside: downloading all the compact blocks still takes up several gigabytes of storage space. It also uses a lot of bandwidth for the initial sync. Until a workaround for this is found, mobile wallets will likely continue to grab information from the electrum network and/or various nodes of wallet creators. Not very many mobile wallets use bloom filters anymore, but those who do (such as Greenaddress and BLW for Android) will probably continue to do so because the bloom filter method still has far lower storage and bandwidth requirements than neutrino. Neutrino is better for laptop wallets currently, whereas most desktop wallets ought to be full node wallets and not rely on things like SPV/Neutrino. Work is still being done to create low-storage, low-bandwidth options for mobile phones that still preserve your privacy. Neutrino isn't that solution -- at least not yet.

10588,"You are basically correct, with some clarifications.

First, if by ""lightning addresses"" you mean the QR codes you see when someone is requesting a lightning payment, that's actually not an address. It's an invoice, or a payment request. They don't last forever, like addresses do; they expire after a certain amount of time, and the longest expiry I've seen is two days. That said, it is possible right now to create invoices that don't have a specific amount of money in the request -- they leave it up to the payer.

Second, the Sphinx Send feature is planned for the next lightning upgrade, and will allow people to give their node ID out and receive payments directly to it without an invoice. If two nodes have already merged the Sphinx code, they can actually already do this; this upgrade doesn't require the whole network to adopt it, though most of the network probably will adopt it, since it's very useful. As Sphinx Send grows in usage, the term ""lightning address"" may take on new meaning as a reference to your node ID.

Third, *lightning channel addresses* are different from *lightning addresses,* in part because the latter isn't a widely used term yet and probably won't be until Sphinx Send grows in usage. But more importantly, lightning *channel* addresses are part of the underlying bitcoin blockchain, and in order to spend money from a lightning *channel* address, both you and your counterparty have to cosign a transaction. This means that if money comes in that you weren't prepared for, your counterparty can theoretically hold that money hostage. It is therefore important that lightning wallet users specify how much money they want to receive into their lightning channel addresses before they receive money into them, and then get their counterparty to cosign a future channel closure transaction in advance that gives the user their cut of the incoming funds (which, initially at least, should be the whole amount).

If any of that sounds confusing, this is part of why writing user friendly lightning wallets is a challenge for engineers. Ideally we'd like to abstract all of the stuff that's difficult to understand away from the user. We want the wallet to handle all of that on the backend, and give the user simple buttons to do what they want, like ""Send"" and Receive."" A second ideal is that it should all be backward compatible with how bitcoin works now. But those are somewhat tough goals to achieve when you're dealing with the nuts and bolts of how it all works. We can expect that various developers will try a lot of different methods of achieving both ideals, and some of the resulting wallets will be more user friendly than others.",19-02-17-16-18,1,18,nowitsalllgone,arhh98

Yes, good point. I suppose a neutrino node could discard compact blocks that don't contain information it needs. That would probably solve the storage problem. It would still use over a megabyte of bandwidth every 10 minutes, but I suppose there are worse bandwidth hogs out there, such as games. If you didn't open your wallet for a while, you'd have to wait for it to download each compact block that came in since the last time you used it, and that would take longer than using bloom filters or just pinging nodes for information about specific addresses, but it would still be more private.",19-02-17-16-18,2,18,nowitsalllgone,arhh98
10591,"As almkglor [explains it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/a0r7o7/what_is_neutrino_and_what_advantages_and/eak7y70), neutrino nodes go to full nodes and say, ""Hey, can I have some data about block X? I only want to know what addresses got mentioned in it."" The full node will then serve it a file, smaller than the full block, only containing a list of addresses that got mentioned in that block. The neutrino node has to download this file (which is called the ""compact block"") and examine it to see if one of its own addresses is mentioned in there. The problem is, neutrino nodes have to ask for address data regarding *many* blocks in the blockchain -- specifically, it has to download a ""compact version"" of every block it might have received money in, i.e., for every block mined after the wallet was created. Before long, this means downloading a significant amount of data every time the wallet needs to sync (which is typically whenever it's opened), far more data than a bloom filter would ask for. There's still work to do to reduce this bandwidth requirement, which is more than a mobile phone should have to download (especially in third world country).",19-02-17-16-18,1,18,nowitsalllgone,arhh98

10595,"most of what you said is right, but I think you might mix up what compact blocks are. Or at least you mix up two ways to call something as they are typically named in the bitcoin world (if we follow BIPs at least).

Now I undestand what you mean. When you say compact blocks you meant „compact filters“ (yes some times called „compacked block filters“, but still filters).

Note that „compact blocks“ and „compact (block) filters“ are two different things.

Compact blocks were existing before the neutrino concept and are used by full nodes to reduce bandwith by knowing that you have a mempool with many uncofirmend transactions and thus give you a file with which you can reconstruct a freshly mined block with their help. I think those compact blocks are not the same for every peer-pair, but depend of the prediction other peers make of your mempool. More infos here:

So, even if this ""reapeating pattern"" stays, it can't be repeating in any way after the next peak. Simply because the pattern asks for longer and longer periods per cycle, but the halvings are set every four years.

Next, in a logarithmic chart like this even a seemingly tiny distance between the line, arrow etc and the actual graph can mean huge differences in absolute numbers or percent. Too bad the scale/grid makes it look like something linear. Do you have a newer version of this? Or higher resolution?

Also, first I was amazed by the neat linear graphs of ""cycle number"" vs ""downturn days"" and ""cycle days"". But of course, those include the guess for the next downturn and cycle. With downturn, we have two points and one guessed point strategically placed so it forms a line with the two real points. With ""cycle"" and three real data points, it's only a bit better.

Finally, the real data since this graph was drawn doesn't fit that well any more, we are higher again than it guessed. At 3600 USD we are at the schedule of end of 2020 already. Again, it might look like a tiny distance on this logarithmic chart. and of course, in hindsight, any (false) peaks and drops are easy to disregard as outliers too.

In conclusion, I don't trust any TA prediction. But am between amused and amazed how well some seem to fit nonetheless. 2023 is too far away for my taste anyway.

I'd love to have a scientist working in statistics, or mathematician or the like have a look at this, these graphs. How much can one fit into a true random graph? How much of this is unexpected in a random graph?

10620,"I have probably spent far too long looking at diagrams like this but my opinion differs slightly from these projections. I cant see a future BTC going through 80-90% retracements as user base and adoption picks up. Each cycle increases the number of long term hodlers and the confidence that BTC wont collapse or disappear. Also more people trying to profit by selling the tops and buying the bottoms limiting the size of the swings.

The future that I think is more likely is that volatility will decrease and the cycles will become faster and smaller. Logically this probably has to happen if BTC is going to be adopted as a global medium of exchange and/or store of value.

With Metcalfe's theory/law it would align with this type of chart showing a logrithmic slowing of adoption. Much like an ""S"" curve.

- Small blocks also encourage faster lightning adoption because it will help make onchain transactions more expensive

The question is whether these merchant banks would forward the fee to merchants or not. If some do and some don't they would simply lose the merchants to their competitors and I doubt that Amazon and Costco would lose a chance like this and agree with the likes of JPM/Citi/BoA. Thus I doubt that these fees will be reflected to the merchants in the end.

This. You have to understand the poverty rate of rural China (and its a big fucking place!) to even begin to understand it, the increase in quality of life is substantial; most peasant subsistence farmers send their children to the city to work in factories to support their families back home. Eventually, they end up at your foxxcon's and such, but this is a huge leap in standard of living for them compared to where they are from. This is why the tout the rise of China as the biggest elevator of poverty in the 21st Century, but it comes at a cost, a really big one. But if you're feeding 5 family members back home and some of them are ill, you don't have time to ask questions. We all know how big the remittances market is internationally, China is no different but they're within its borders.

Simply put, I've seen this in the US, too. And one can argue this is exactly what happened post WWII with the boomers, one the largest increases in standard of living came at a cost: Nuclear proliferation, Military Industrial complex, Global US Imperialism, near constant and perpetual War, the rise of Intelligence agencies that target their own Society in addition to those abroad etc... The same thing applies here.

Prior to Snowden you were considered a crazy person for thinking about what the NSA does so broadly, and the FAANG's very close relationship with the State; I mean who the fuck didn't think Myspace/FB was just a massive aggregator of personal information made fashionable by anyone with power who would want to surveil their populace, if you had some background in Cypherpunk-Cryptoanarchy philosophy. And most people STILL use it despite those revelations to this day!

Anyhow, I think its too broad to paint a picture of those 'myopic Chinese citizens,' though Mainland Chinese are seriously the worst tourists in my experience, it think its more  a byproduct of confining wealth creation and upward mobility to a Nation-State who are subject to the propaganda and indoctrination I alluded to before.

*Edit:* The halving of the block reward until no more are produced (which will be sometime around the year 2140) is to help ensure that Bitcoin will always be *deflationary* in nature, and according to a predicable schedule.

Not really. The difficulty is adjusting upwards only because there are more miners in the network. For example, if Bitcoin price drops, the difficulty will also fall because theoretically it becomes unprofitable for some miners to continue operations and the puzzles become easier to solve.

Block halving is built into the network to slowly reduce the inflation to zero over a hundred years. There is no need for the block reward over fees to be permanent.

Consider that the first block rewards of 50 BTC were worth a few dollars. Now they get bigger rewards for solving bigger puzzles. If they get smaller fee for difficult puzzles, hash rate drops, difficulty drops and puzzles get easier.

No, the reason the hash difficulty level sometimes rises is not because of the nature of elliptic curve cryptography. Hash difficulty drops sometimes too, as you can see from [this graph](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13oe7BpwTSbTCDy3O5AUvF2vh0OuchULj/preview). The hash difficulty level usually rises because mining is profitable and that profitability draws more miners in. The network adjusts to the increased number of miners by increasing the difficulty of mining so that blocks are found at the same rate they were found at before. But for most miners there are occasions when mining is not profitable, causing them to turn off their mining equipment. When that happens, the network adjusts by lowering the difficulty. That's why on the graph I just linked you to, you can see that mining sometimes gets harder, but other times it gets easier.

Actually (and I could be wrong about this), I thought that the reason hash difficulty goes up is because of more miners joining the network, which itself is a result of Bitcoin's value rising, not because of elliptic curve cryptography. But yeah, I could be wrong. Satoshi and others in the beginning of Bitcoin actually *did* mine for absolutely nothing for a while (because it wasn't worth anything yet), and afterwards for only the tiny amount that Bitcoin was worth! Back then, it wasn't about turning a profit, but about furthering the experiment that they hoped could undo the grip of the banking cartels.

What happens is that there IS a lot of gold in the sense that we keep finding more, but the amount we find per year is not a lot, it's something like 1-2% of the supply and still fits under the Eiffel tower because gold is very dense so you can do a lot of things with a very tiny amount.

I'm sure the mining will get to where it needs to be.

If the BFR is successful it will bootstrap an entire class of super heavy lift rockets that will provide cheap access to space. I'd be surprised and disappointed if in 60 years the BFR was still the largest rocket that we were working with. I'd expect a larger even more cost effective iteration using the same basic technologies within 10-20 years, so by 2050.

And redirecting an asteroid into earth's orbit isn't particularly difficult if you go out far enough where you just need to nudge it a bit.

Further, all of this gets a lot more cost effective once you can start manufacturing in space, which should also certainly be achieveable by 2050.

Both Gold and Bitcoin will over time be disinflationary in the sense that the increase in the supply per year increasing will be lower in total numbers and percent. The amount of gold on earth is for all intents and purposes fixed, it will just be mined over an extremely long time and slower over time.  


The main difference in Bitcoin and Gold in mining is not the amounts being fixed, or that a higher price makes more work for them happen, but that with gold an increased price leads (over a couple years) to a higher rate of mining, a slightly higher supply inflation, while with Bitcoin the inflation rate it predetermined and more work will not mine Bitcoin faster.  


There has been many of completely finite things that has a market price in the world, Bitcoin is the first digital one that can be exchanged. It is not the first crypto that has currently 0% inflation and a fixed upper cap though, and the number of those cryptos that can be created is not limited.

If you owned government bonds or currency, and the currency experiences hyper inflation and is no longer used, you're outta luck. But no matter how many new economies are formed, no matter how many new paper currencies are introduced, gold will have a measurement in each one and can be exchanged for each one.

Carry enough cargo in a single trip and using an optimized one-use descent vessel starts to become feasible.

But honestly, I'm really just betting on really really big rockets. I'm pretty sure once reusable rockets saturate the launch market and become a reliable mature technology, we'll begin to push the limits of the largest rocket that's feasible to build, especially since thrust, control, wet:dry mass, and economies of scale all work in favor of huge rockets.

Adjusted for inflation the price of gold can go down over a decade+, but way slower than anything else could, the most extreme example in recent history was it going down 50%+ over two years+ (adjusted for inflation).  


From 1980 to 2000 it was better to hold USD in a 0% interest bank account, so there are exceptions to it, but as you say, if things are going south it is a good bet (if it does not become illegal to own gold, which while unlikely is more likely to happen in extreme situations).

One has virtually nothing on it (about 10 cents), the other has roughly $11 worth of bitcoin, so I'm not too precious about recovery if it's impossible.

I guess something happened during the time newer version of the node was connected. Or changing back to the backup caused some drama. The backup was literally about 5 hours old and I'd done no transactions since the backup but obviously I might have routed things.

All except this channel and another one with a few cents on it closed without too much bother, although it took several days.

Really odd but I guess that's how it goes. This was always a possibility of course, so I only put on what I could afford to lose.

Note: if the first sentence of this post sounds like a contradiction, it's not. When a lightning payment is set up, each party involved -- including all intermediary nodes -- have to create and sign a payment contract that will send money to their counterparty if and only if they fulfill that contract by giving the payer a random number (called a preimage) created by the recipient. Once the recipient has a signed transaction by his counterparty, he reveals the preimage, and uses it to fulfill his contract. His counterparty then has it, so he uses it to fulfill his contract, which means that his counterparty has it, and so forth until it gets back to the original payer. So if you don't have that contract, then your payment is still in your wallet, and the recipient shouldn't give you that preimage until they've received your payment.",19-02-16-22-42,6,18,nowitsalllgone,ar8346

11672,"There are two other independent implementations on lightning protocol that are not related to blockstream at all. The code is completely open source.

There is almost no money in it for blockstream. The cost of running a LN node is tiny and blockstream have absolutely no advantage to any one else in this. 

if you are suggesting they are just out to kill Bitcoin completely that is equally absurd. Many of these guys are Bitcoin OGs. They know the tech well and they are heavily invested in seeing Bitcoin succeed. They wouldn't be easily fooled by some banker investor. Also it would be a stupid tactic as it's pretty obvious that another crypto would take its place and equally threaten the banks. 

Second layer solutions have been talked about since near the beginning of Bitcoin. Even by Satoshi himself. This is not a new idea that blockstream invented. It's been heavily researched and there are plenty of smart people on both sides of the debate. Waaay more than are under the control of blockstream.

There will always be medium to high value transactions happening on the base layer and giving miners fees. Ln is just opening up small and micro payments which is a new use case that hardley is used on the main chain anyway. Taking a percentage of the fees away from miners is arguably better than letting miners form centralized server farm cartels due to high blocksize. Where security would be completely lost. I believe miners centralisation is way bigger problem than miners loosing some transactions fees. Did you know bch miners get less than $1 per block for transaction fees. In btc it's over $400. Big blocks aren't helping. Hardley worth fighting for.

11673,"> I therefore ask you now and everyone who reads this to look a bit deeper at the company blockstream ..

This is a very stupid straw man. Blockstream does not control Bitcoin and they do not control lightning Network. It's a network protocol with multiple open source implementations. 

Of course everyone knows this except you. So all you've done is made a laughingstock of yourself.

Since your tiny mind can't understand why blockstream would do this I'm going to blow your mind with a very simple concept - it's called investment into the future.

If you are a major grain distributor in the 1600s, you might take proceeds from your revenue and have more roads built so that more wagons travel through your distribution area. The roads will never pay you back because they are just roads, instead it is the increased traffic on those roads that will lead to much higher volume sales. If you try to build a toll road the people might just say screw that and never come to you. 

Blockstream is invested on the Enterprise side of Bitcoin land. They are making institutional products for a different class of providers in the business ecosystem, e.g. exchanges. So they are investing into the technology with a long-term vision, because they know that the more that the network succeeds, the more businesses that will end up buying their Enterprise products.

My wealth gets stolen from me to rescue the 'too big to fail' banks and I and everyone I know gets poorer as a result. If I have 'too much' money in my account and I happen to live in the wrong country, I get a 'hair cut' where my wealth is outright stolen from me, otherwise it's just inflated away in a slow and stealthy manner so they hope I won't notice.

Even when I do the 'right' thing and avoid debt and save for my future, my savings rates go down from 5%+ to less than 1% because the government has given them so much money they have no incentive to attract mine.

Now, nearly a decade later, wages are still below 2008 levels, people are 'underemployed' desperate for full time hours but only getting 10-20 hours a week, savings rates are below 2% and these lying bastards are somehow still making more and more profit and foreclosing on houses because the banks were bailed out but the people were not, even though it was the finance sector that caused this mess.

The next crash will make 2007/2008 look tame in comparison. We will see negative interest rates as **still** nobody is learning the lesson about fixing the roof when the sun was shining. And I'll end up paying for that as well. For something which is nothing to do with me.

11962,"I think gold and silver will be a great complimentary asset to bitcoin in the coming years. If you take a look at historical interest rates you fill see that in response to the 2008 financial crisis we dropped interest rates from around 5.5 to zero and kept them there for almost ten years. The effect interest rates play in the economy is that the fed funds rate is the basis for all other interest rates such as your car loan, student loans, your mortgage, etc. When we drop interest rates this is supposed to stir the economy up by boosting spending. For example: You might not take that loan to start a business if the interest rate you are paying is 30 percent, but you would be more likely too if they were closer to say 5 percent. I am just making up these numbers in order to illustrate my point. 

The problem is this gives the false illusion of ""free money"" and is a great way of making the poor feel rich. The wealth gap in America is at its highest since the 1930s. So while yes the stock market and asset prices have seen a massive bull run, it is a disproportionately small amount of people who are realizing this benefit. The average american in my opinion is actually suffering in the sense that we have taken on even larger amounts of debt than we did in 2008. The U.S. national debt sits at 22 trillion, we currently have historic levels of student loan debt, and also historic amounts of people who are 90 days or more late on their automobile loans. This tells us that rising asset prices have indeed not helped the average american, because if it did we would have decreased our levels of debt instead of increasing them.

In 2008 dropping interest rates to zero alone was not enough to save us. The federal reserve our central bank, who might I add is privately owned by shareholders, introduced a new form of economic policy they called quantitative easing.  I call it asset inflation. This is where they buy mostly U.S treasury bonds and also MBS's(mortgage backed securities), however keep in mind that when the fed  buys a bond they are doing so with an account balance of zero and are essentially creating new money from thin air by typing a few numbers into a computer. These bonds, MBS's and other securities that they ""purchase"" are what make up their asset sheet which has grown from around 0.8 trillion to over 4.5 trillion in the time period of 2008-2014 when they finally stopped. 

I believe the federal reserve did not save us, and instead they kept a bubble alive and it has become much nastier. Recently we have experienced turbulent times in the stock market and the fed has seemed to soften their stance of raising interest rates. If we can't raise rates past three percent without sending the market into a death spiral what will happen in the next recession when we can only take interest rates from 2.5 to 0? We will have to do a fourth round of quantitative easing that will probably be bigger than the first three rounds combined, and that boogie man named inflation will come out to play. 

Bonus Tips:

\-Take a look at the ten year vs two year treasury yield and look at the dates every time the gap closes (hint hint their was a recession) 

\-Central Banks are currently buying the most amount of gold they have since WWII.

No. The security of drawing a random word out of a dictionary of 2048 words -- and doing so 12 times -- is just as secure as a private key, which is created by drawing a random bit out of 2 possible bits (one or zero) -- and doing so 256 times. Both are computationally infeasible to figure out by a brute force attack.

To be more mathematically precise, it is true that a 12 word recovery key only has 128 bits of entropy, whereas a private key has 256 bits of entropy. But a 24 word recovery key has the same 256 bits of entropy that a private key does, and, more importantly, 128 bits and 256 bits are both are computationally infeasible to figure out by a brute force attack. Thus, whether you use a 12 word recovery key, a 24 word recovery key, or a private key, you've still attained the same security goal: no one can ""guess"" your recovery key or your private key, not even if they harness all the computing power in the world.

> I thought the whole point of the 40 random case sensitive private key was to increase complexity and security.

No. Complexity and security are inversely related; the more complex a security system is, the more flaws it is likely to have. Secure systems are simple. One simple security mechanism (at least when an attacker has to figure out a password or something similar to a password) is to use a long, random password. Judged by that standard, a twelve-word recovery key is just as secure as a private key. (Well, within the caveats I mentioned in my second paragraph of this post.)

Neutrino wallets are a type of SPV wallet, and all SPV wallets are vulnerable to a Proof of Work attack. Since SPV wallets don't verify transactions but only check that the proof of work has been done, any miner could cheat an SPV wallet by mining an invalid block with valid proof of work. They could then put an invalid transaction in there paying the SPV wallet for some product. The SPV wallet would check the proof of work, see that it matches what the bitcoin network says the proof of work should currently be, and then accept the invalid transaction, since SPV wallets don't verify transactions. The miner would walk away with the product, and the SPV wallet would be broken since it has accepted a block that all full nodes reject.

In short, SPV wallets are not trustless. They trust miners not to cheat them. A base bitcoin node is necessary in order to have a trustless (or trust minimized) wallet.",19-02-16-09-36,1,18,nowitsalllgone,ar272u

Yes, the term ""confirm"" means ""is included in a block"". Transaction fees are completely voluntary for all users wishing to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain, but those who are writing the blocks (miners) will generally be profit-seeking, and will take those that offer a larger fee.

If Bitcoin reached such high prices, that'd either cause or be caused by world-shaking events: BTC would have a market cap greater than the USD M3 money supply, and quite a few BTC early adopters would have wealth comparable to countries.

The easiest way to reach $1 million will be USD hyperinflation. I think that this will happen sometime in the next 50 years, since it seems to me to be the only plausible outcome for the US's addiction to debt. But this says more about the value of USD than BTC.

To reach $1 million in today's value:

1. There could be truly extraordinary growth in demand, probably caused by a worldwide lack of faith in fiat or some other major event.
2. Even in the absence of much growth, if Bitcoin remains the premier cryptocurrency, then I'd expect the value to continuously (but not necessarily quickly) rise in real terms because BTC is highly deflationary.

I think that there's substantial room for growth in demand -- I wouldn't be surprised to see $10k again within a year or two, for example --, but I'm not sure about growth to $1 million in the next couple of decades at least. The fact is that most people are fine with using things like credit cards, bank autopayments, bank-linked payment apps, etc. They're easy enough, and since the payments are reversible, they're highly forgiving of the average person's absolutely abominable security practices. (There are of course many major problems with traditional payments, but the *average person* doesn't care enough.)

In order to reach $1 million levels anytime soon, we'd need at least:

* Hardware infrastructure. Point-of-sale would need the equivalent of credit card terminals, and every person would need secure hardware wallets either on a dedicated device or on their phones. You need to somehow prevent almost all cases of: phishing, malware, wallet bugs, forgotten passwords, mugging someone out of their life savings, etc.
* Some off-chain solution would have to be working perfectly. It's unacceptable for the average person to worry about fees or confirmations.
* There'd have to be significant pull to BTC (merchants passing on lower costs, maybe) and/or significant push from fiat (eg. hyperinflation, widespread privacy concerns, confiscation, etc.).
* Governments can't become too authoritarian. Bitcoin can be made to function even if every country makes it illegal, but that'd make it too difficult for ordinary people to use it. It'd be similar to how most Chinese people don't know how to bypass the Great Firewall, even though it's technically possible.

There are plausible technical solutions for at least the first two points, but we're **nowhere near** achieving them all.

As for value increases due to deflation: I consider it pretty likely that BTC will still be the premier cryptocurrency in 50 years; maybe an 85% probability. If so, that implies in my mind an on-average-increasing value. But even if the price goes up to $100k in 10 years through growth, I'm not sure that deflation alone will be enough to carry us to $1 million in an additional 40 years",19-02-16-06-06,10,9723,theymos,aqzzpy

Also, re:

> There could be truly extraordinary growth in demand, probably caused by a worldwide lack of faith in fiat or some other major event.

No; the price is reflexive to small movements of coins and small spikes in demand. It doesn't take much to spike price significantly—the current price is quite divorced from most arbitrary measures of value (such as market cap) and can be elevated or depressed well outside of proportion to the costs and money required to do so. The wealth of the OG'ers you're describing in the event of a huge price spike would be nowhere near small countries' actual economic strengths, and we are as a whole **nowhere near** any significant real-world economy. We can say that a trade of n XBT equals the value of those XBT, but that has nothing to do with the market cap and thus reasoning about price in this fashion will also result in false conclusions.

We knew this the last price spike, as any OG'er who was willing to dump *could never have extracted anywhere near the value of their coins' market-cap equivalent* regardless of whether they used dark pool sells or OTC or whatever. The demand simply wasn't there.

I don't see there being any issue at all with what we might consider an absurd price now except as price nears or drops below mining costs. There is no such constraint on the top end, since people who own it could simply decide collectively they won't trade for anything less than $30k or higher per-coin. (After all, the decimal location is a psychological construct that has nothing to do with reality whatsoever.)

So far the best micro-measure of it IMO is the market depth estimate website. That seems to be a fair proportional measure of relative economic strengths of the various altcoins and Bitcoin. Beyond that, watching on-chain transactions and seeing how much money is actually being used (and not just shuffled, if it's even possible to measure such things) would be additive.

The exchanges that have fees (for everyone) also have volumes which I think are descriptive. I mean.. assuming exchanges aren't just out there totally fabricating lies of course.

If there were a way to disambiguate the arbitragers (by watching which market moves the price via first action) so we could watch what actual dumps or buys do to perturb the price that would give us I think some idea of the strength of the independence of Bitcoin's economy.

M3 supply IMO can't really be compared with even the pure Bitcoin released money supply. M3 doesn't have a price-like component except perhaps one of those inflation measures designed to identify how much of a basket $x can buy compared to what it could buy in the past. But in our case, the amount of equivalent stuff in Bitcoin would be radically perturbed (in a downward sense) the more someone tried to involve larger and larger amounts of Bitcoin. That amount of perturbation, it seems to me, would be an excellent measurement.

But someone fiddling around with a few billions dollars here and there doesn't change the *buying power* of the USD. So.. eh. Even there.

BTW, I hope I didn't come across as lecturing you or presuming ignorance—it's clear you're being thoughtful about it. But e.g. Trace Meyer when he uses market cap as some kind of commodity-equivalent economic measure..  I mean we're nowhere near e.g. the actual gold industry in terms of an economy.

The top mining *industries* w.r.t gold-the-metal contribute something like $170b to the world economy as a whole in a year. Our current total buying orderbooks worldwide are barely $250m. Golds trading volumes are in the trillions per day. There's no real other way to measure it without doing what everyone else does—sampling the related economies and doing some arithmetic.

12467,"His approach yields a number 2X or 4X too high. 

Doesn't mean these aren't significant numbers though.

At the chart's 73 tWH peak, divide by 365 (days per year) then divide by 24 (hours per day) and multiply X 1,000,000 (1M) and you have the number of MW.  MWs are a better way to measure because that's how the capacity of power plants are referenced, for example.   Mining is 24/7 (i.e., ""peak"" usage is the same level as ""off peak low"") so this conversion (/365 and then /24) works and is easy.

So doing that calculation results in ~8,400 MW.  So if he's 2X too high, that's still ~4,200 MW that was drawn by mining at the peak.  Others had estimated we were seeing ~5,000 MW, so cutting Digiconomist's numbers by half seems to be closer to being accurate.

Anyway, ... so the Hoover Dam generates about 600 MW (average over the year).  Bitcoin mining was drawing the equivalent of what is generated by 8 Hoover dams.   That's not a small number. 

It's not that Bitcoin requires 5,000 MW of electricity to be kept secure.  It's that 8.25 BTC X 144 BTC/day X 365days/year yields 433K BTC per year to miners.    At current spot price of ~$3,500, that's $15B earned per year by miners.  Or about $4.2M / day revenue to miners.

On the expense side, consumption of 5,000 MW X 1,000KW/MW X 24 hours/day = 120,000,000 kWh per day 
If miners pay the really cheap rate of $0.035 per kWh, that's about $4.2M / day spent in electricity.  Or extrapolated to a year (X 365) that's about $15B.

Kind of wild, eh?   Revenue to miners?  $15B/year.  Amount spent on electricity?  $15B/year. 

That's no coincidence.  It's called the miner's equilibrium.

So as the BTC/USD price increases, hashrate will increase as well (though it will lag a bit). 

Looking forward ..., when you see claims that Bitcoin will hit $50K (nearly 15X today's price), ... that means that mining consumption would increase 15X as well.   Crazy, eh?  Well, 2017 to 2019 hashrate rose 7X, so another 15X increase should not be dismissed outright.  But 5X 5,000 MW is 75,000 MW.  There simply isn't 70,000 MW (75,000 MW future - 5,000 MW current) of excess cheap (i.e., hydro or other excess renewable) electricity out there.

More likely with a $50K BTC/USD would be that miners become extremely profitable (again) and electricity consumption from Bitcoin mining causes a global floor on the price of electricity, as miners add hashrate most anywhere in the world they can get kWh priced below the miner's equilibrium level.  That could be 4X the previous peak level of 5,000 MW (i.e., in the 20,000 MW range) or maybe a little more even.

I understand the complaint that these private chains are not as immutable as bitcoin, but even bitcoin isn't perfectly immutable. It's like constant values in a programming language. There are lots of evil techniques for subverting constness guarantees, so it's not perfect. But it does help catch a lot of writes you didn't intend to make.

Databases can be used as a ledger, but they're not generally designed for append-only data; they update in-place. Furthermore you need a way to replicate the database to all participants.

Bitcoin is an entire other beast and unique immutability model, private blockchains aren't doing anything we haven't been able to do for decades.

If your company is setting up a private blockchain with for example six other companies, where all companies run their own node, then the data will be immutable unless you have a majority. I mean you can alter your own node, or even work together with another company, but you cannot change the data of all nodes in the blockchain unless everybody agrees.

Also if you want to change data, it won't go unnoticed if you have other stakeholders with a read-only node in the network. For example you can allow your customers to set up a node where they can keep a copy of all data locally.

In short, you don't need blockchain if you are the only user. In any other case it will give you added data security. The larger the network, the more security you can get.",19-02-16-03-29,1,215,MediaSmurf,aqyb0b

The funny part is your second part about a fixed supply.  Anyone that has taken a single Econ class can figure out what happens to the price when there is a fixed amount of something. Typically fixed items have high price tags with them. 

Now what happens to the price of a currency when there isn’t a fixed supply? The supply is always increasing. Supply and demand have an indirect relationship. This is proven, not theory. As supply increases prices will drop. The value of the dollar continues to drop. 

Real life example Diamonds. If increasing supply was good they wouldn’t control release diamonds to keep the price high. Somehow diamonds are crazy expensive with such a limited supply policy.

I would like to state that in theory the Keynesian approach does work. You got cheap inflationary money, you got credit, people spend more, the economy is happy and the debt cycle begins. And printing money to ease a debt cycle induced recession, again makes sense. But you have to put your emphasis on “ease“. Easing the pain is possible, easing not stopping it.

Now, in reality this beautiful theory doesn't work due to the human factor. At first (the first few debt cycles) it begins as everyone expects it to be. Economy goes up, economy goes down. But you have an overall gradually ascension. Then, someone says “Damn boy, I don't want no decline, I wanna have unlimited power. Capitalism f*ck yeah.“

Greed kicks in. The credit machine never slows down, even in recession times, but not to ease the pain, to help the economy. Nope. Mostly to make yourself (insert the institution of banks) filthy rich. Debt cycles goes out of control. Debt goes out of control. Now someone should pay the bill. Bad companies and bad banks should go bankrupt to cleanse the system. Capitalism, you remember how that works right? 
But hell no. The little human got used to his lifestyle and doesn't want to be poor again. Lets try to stop the pain by printing more money and inflate it even more, because the little human can't accept the fact that some pain has be be endured. What to do? Maybe print money and give some more credit. Gotta keep the game rollin'. And at some point we reach a level of no return. Although a superlittle minority profits and is the winner of that derby, the famous 99.8% of us are on the loser team.

13128,">If you think that's shitty, their bank partner just closed a bunch of accounts with no warning

Here's the thing: this is likely to happen each and every time you use one of those. 

The convenience of having a Visa or MC logo on that thing is an indication of this occurring. It was Wavecrest killing off all those cards before that, too. Every time we try to insert that payment network into this space we seriously always end up back here, with even more backlash--though I'd argue the Wavecrest closure was bigger. 

This is why we needed to get Layer 2 with LN up and running asap, and onboard merchants that way to take it directly. I speak from experience when I say that anytime Visa or MC is involved: always assume this is going to happen. 

Its not random, its deliberate; we're gate crashing their monoplistic party, and this is the way the retaliate. There will always be short windows of operation in which their partners can obscure what it is that they are doing, but they will inevitably find out, and the last thing we should be doing is building on a system that relys on it, rather than creating infrastructure to rout around it.

I've come to realize, after all these years of using those cards, that when you sacrifice security for (perceived) convenience we forget why this tech was invented in the first place. And ultimately are left with a significant setback.

I just hope for your sake you have access to funds beyond what you loaded on that card, or at least someone back home that can send you some if needed.

Also, you should acknowledge that credit card payments are pull payments, meaning anyone can pull payments from the account provided they have a 16-digit number and a date (and maybe a cvv code). With Bitcoin, you're dealing with push payments, meaning nobody can continue pulling payments from your account. And your account cannot be sold on darknet markets either. Yes, it's true that your private keys can be exposed, just as you can get your leather wallet stolen from your back pocket.

13326,"Because this question gets asked a lot I'm afraid and sometimes it's done by timewasters to only belittle cryptocurrencies...

Reading through the comments I've not seen anyone actually give you a decent reply yet so here goes...

&#x200B;

Bitcoin private keys are built on elliptic curve maths, basically that private key number produces a public key number (well two numbers but can consider it one number).  Call the private key number 'k', the public key it generates 'P'.  There are something like 2 \^ 224 possibilities of valid 'k' numbers (my values might be out as doing it from memory).  This is such a vastly large number that if we were to take a regular PC starting at 1 and adding 1 again and again, it would take more energy than we think there is in the entire universe to do and certainly more time than the universe has existed... it's an unfathomable number.

So this 'brute force' approach will never work.  What can happen however is someone might find a trick in the ECDSA maths.  So when a transaction is published you publish a challenge that typically takes knowing that private number 'k' to produce a valid answer based on the information present in the last tx.  If someone manages to figure out going from public key 'P' back to 'k' it would be considered compromised.

Now ECDSA is so widely used that should someone 'crack' that, all banking systems and the internet would become vulnerable... bitcoin would be the least of our woes.   Now this has happened in the past, Sony for instance made a mistake in their signing algorithm of ECDSA and this subtle bug meant it was possible to derive k from P and is how the PS3 was hacked.  Clearly the guys working on cryptocurrency get a lot more peer-reviews and testing since money is being transacted that any flaw like this would likely be found by now.

That said it may be possible with Quantum computing, HOWEVER bitcoin also doesn't publish the full public key of the receiver in transactions, it typically publishes a HASH of the public key.  I.e. it's like a fingerprint that only the public key number can generate.  

Many other public keys (and therefore private keys) can also generate that hash number in a tx but again it's a numbers game.  There is something like 2\^192 numbers you'd have to check to find a duplicate... again it's not happening in the lifetime of the universe.  This part is unlikely to be solved by quantum computers since it's about a series of bit shifting operations rather than maths.  Something QCs are rubbish at.

Also only when going to spend the coins is the public key actually revealed and why people say you should always avoid reusing a bitcoin address for security.  If ECDSA were to be compromised, the public key->private key 'crack' would have a very small window (the time for the next block) before it were possible to steal.  Even with a QC it's unreasonable to expect it to compromised a 256 bit ECDSA key in under 10 minutes... not impossible but unlikely.

So in summary, yes bitcoin is safe for the foreseeable future and if both the ECDSA and SHA256 hash do somehow get compromised in our lifetime it is also feasible to migrate to another signature system that is resilient to whatever attack happened since it's a distributed community that enforces the rules of what makes a valid transaction.  I.e. people running bitcoin want it to be secure so can adapt if obviously needed and has happened in the past.

Corrupt Files/data in the event of a power outage is a concern. Since when a pi loses power from an outlet it immediately shuts off. That would be my biggest worry, since the lnd service and bitcoind service won’t be given proper time to safely stop before losing power. But again this is mainly a concern in the event of power outages. If you want to move your pi and disconnect it temporarily, you should always follow standard shutdown procedures anyway.

As for how long the download and verification of the blockchain will take, it depends on how high-end your computer is that you’re using to download the blockchain from. For me, my computer is a piece of shit laptop that’s at least 5-6 years old and it took me 2 weeks to download the entire blockchain onto its internal storage. From the internal storage, I used FileZilla (or any other file transfer you wanna use such as WinSCP or what the guide uses) to transfer that blockchain data onto the FORMATTED (ext4 format) HDD which took roughly 10-12 hours.

Up to now, my main use has been to buy some bitcoin as insurance against the banking system imploding.  Like a repeat of 2008.

Suppose that happens and it much worse than 2008.  In the 1930s, when the fractional reserve gold standard collapsed, and was about to take the banking system down, FDR signed [executive order 6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102).  This act made it illegal for americans to own monetary gold.  They were then forced to sell their gold to the government.  From that article:
> The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and making the depression worse
>
>...
>
>Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve, in exchange for $20.67 (consumer price index, adjusted value of $400 today)[4] per troy ounce. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the recently passed Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 (equivalent to $193,548 today)[4] or up to ten years in prison, or both.
>
>Order 6102 specifically exempted ""customary use in industry, profession or art"", a provision that covered artists, jewelers, dentists, and sign makers among others. The order further permitted any person to own up to $100 in gold coins (a face value equivalent to 5 troy ounces (160 g) of gold valued at about $6,339 in 2016). The same paragraph also exempted ""gold coins having recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins"". That protected recognized gold coin collections from legal seizure and likely melting.
>
>The price of gold from the Treasury for international transactions was then raised by the Gold Reserve Act to $35 an ounce ($677 today)[4]. The resulting profit that the government realized funded the Exchange Stabilization Fund established by the Gold Reserve Act in 1934. 

I could imagine the government making the same argument as then but w.r.t. bitcoin.  It would go like this:

1. the government is not able to print money to simulate the economy because bitcoin has become the only credible form of hard money that people and foreign governments will accept.

2. a few lucky people managed to buy bitcoin before it achieved its present price level, and are hoarding their ill-gotten, undeserved windfall profits, which is starving the rest of the economy of the liquidity necessary to allow growth

3. therefore, it is now illegal for american citizens to own bitcoin, and they have to sell it to the government for a little more than they bought it for.  If they don't have records proving how much they paid for it, we will assume they paid $100 / BTC.

4. the bitcoin the government recovers in this way will then be used as to settle foreign accounts by setting a conversion rate of $1M / BTC.

5.  we will call this the Brettcoin Woods system.

Under those conditions, I really don't know what I would do.  I might simply claim that I lost the private keys.  It would be hard for anyone to prove otherwise.  I would then wait for the madness to end, and for it to be safe for me to use bitcoin again.

It would really depend on what sort of threats the U.S. government was up against.  If it were up against something like WWII / Nazi Germany, I might comply.  If it had become something like Nazi Germany, I would like to think I would resist and perhaps even use my bitcoin to fund the resistance.

As Jordan Peterson likes to point out, however, most people, when they read history, like to imagine they are either a victim or a hero.  Few people read history as if they were likely to be a perpetrator.  That's how you have to read it, however, if you really want to understand it and perhaps be in a position to stop the nightmare from happening again.

In case your transaction may be subjected to the verification, you'll get the special alert at the Confirmation stage. If the user refuses to undergo the AML/KYC procedure, the transaction will be rejected and the crypto assets will be returned to where it originated from less any applicable fees. Secondly, we'd like to know what do you mean by ""least convenient time""? If you are experiencing any issues with our service or had difficulties in the past, please specify them and we'll investigate the problem. Thanks!",19-02-15-12-43,1,1140,changelly_com,aqrf25

After that, we added a notification that the user can see before they send us money. This notification implies a box a user must tick. Without doing that, they are unable to perform a transaction. The notification system and the verification flow has been significantly improved and transactions subjected to KYC check are processed much faster and less stressful for our users.

From Shakepay’s POV, a startup can’t make your situation “right” because they run on pretty tight margins, and they likely took a loss on the card fiasco as well.

Some asteroids, particularly ""M-type"" asteroids, actually contain much higher concentrations of precious metals than the Earth's crust, in some cases so much higher that building and launching probes there to mine it and return it would be wildly profitable. NASA estimates that just one near-Earth asteroid, 16 Psyche, contains roughly 10 quintillion dollars' worth of precious metals at the current market prices. Of course, it wouldn't be possible to sell it all for that much money, as the sudden huge influx of supply would crater the markets, but that's my point.

People around the world eagerly began using the Bitcoin fork, leading to a rapid and controlled influx of users.

The block size was increased several times to accompany the exponentially growing userbase.

Those bigger blocks began weighing the network down, regardless of changes rapidly implemented, such as CTOR and the like. Propagation of blocks and transactions began limiting the use of non-mining full nodes, which had been deemed non-essential to the network long ago. Mounting costs in bandwidth, storage, and IO operations slowly forced out the smaller players, leaving only the mining pool operators.

Lottery tickets have a negative EV.

The stock market has a theoretically positive EV, but not high enough to match the interest rate of most loans unless you get a great deal.

&#x200B;

In the latter case, I would consider a bank loan if I thought my return was likely to net a higher value that the bank interest. Is that in crypto?: no. It's not that I don't trust crypto long term, it's just that it is still possible that this bear market will continue for years. I don't \*think\* it will, I \*hope\* it won't, but that doesn't make it so.

&#x200B;

Still, if the bank was willing to loan me 100k at an interest rate lower than say 5% compounded annually, and I could diversify my investments across the entire market from crypto to FAANG to mutual funds, absolutely I'd take it. I don't see this any different than a normal business loan. But then, I trade on the stock market as a side hobby, and other than crypto, I've pulled a profit with my investments (and I still have faith in my crypto investments, simply by the fact that I have no intention or need to sell anything while I'm at a loss, so either crypto goes to zero or I profit after enough DCA).
