Everythin I read just says that I have it without saying where it actually is. You would think it was trivially obvious that that should be one of the first things told.

53,"Settlement layer is a transaction system meant for large amounts, and tends to be expensive to use. The international wire system is a good example of that - $25 to send $10,000 isn't unreasonable, but when you try to do smaller transactions, $25 to send $10 is stupid. Thus, you need a second layer transaction system to handle smaller payments for a smaller fee (like $0.10) - think Visa or Interac. However, this means that there are multiple layers of fees and middle-men that make the system complicated, slow, and overall more expensive than if everyone could use one solution (say, Visa to send $10,000 overseas for $0.10).

Right now Bitcoin is like the wire transfer system, with a fee that is based on supply and demand. Wit low demand, the fee was low, pennies per transaction. However, there is a cap on how many transactions can be confirmed every 10 minutes (however many fit in a 1MB block of transactions). As BTC got popular, the fee went up; we're well past $5 now to get your transaction sent. And the high cost is driving potential BTC users away to other coins.

Segwit is complicated, but it basically boils down to stuffing more transactions into each block using a lot of math and complicated code. It works, but it's not a great solution and doesn't allow for many more transactions to go through which is the heart of the issue; IIRC it's about 1.7x as many as the original blocks in a best case scenario, and often a lot less.

On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash simply increases the block size to 8MB, so 8 times as many transactions fit in each block, increasing the supply and thus reducing the price of transactions. The only real drawback to that is the slightly increased bandwidth cost, which at some point will become a problem for the average internet connection. We're waaaay off from that right now, though.",17-08-19-05-55,24,1226,Lancks,6ukcw5

LN is an interesting approach - and I wish Rusty and the team well - but there is a chicken and egg problem deployment here, and other crypto coins have already implemented on-chain fast payments. DASH for example has both InstantSend (speed) and PrivateSend (good anonymity) available without resorting to a layer 2 design.

This happened because a large chunk the real, Bitcoin community (the one that wasn't being managed by [agenda driven moderation](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)) moved into r/btc long before Bitcoin Cash was born, to escape the moderator manipulation of the community. 

The r/btc community fought long and hard to stop the BTC chain from being taken-over and re-purposed into a high-value transaction settlement system or just a, so-called, ""store of value"". The last and final hope to keep the BTC chain, somewhat close to the original design of Bitcoin was Segwit2X. After it failed r/btc and other uncensored Bitcoin communities gave up on the BTC chain. It was clear it has been taken over. At this point a huge number of people from r/btc shifted their attention to the recent Bitcoin Cash chain as this chain appeared to be embracing the original design for Bitcoin; namely:

* SPV wallets
* No RBF
* On-chain scaling
* Decentralization of everything to maintain the trustless quality of Bitcoin. This includes decentralization of development teams. BCH has multiple dominant implementations and BTC only has 1 (Bitcoin Core).",18-09-14-06-56,11,1553,hapticpilot,9flsc3

200,"An atomic swap is just another way to make a trade. The trade has to be valid in the first place. For example, you would not trade me 5 of your BCH for 2 dollars because they are worth way more than that. 

The way an atomic swap works is each trader breaks the thing they want to trade into tiny pieces. Let's say we're trading online and you're thousands of miles away from me. With atomic swaps we don't need to trust each other nor do we need escrow because we only trade a tiny piece at a time. So I send one piece then you send one. This happens over and over (but very rapidly) until we each have the complete thing. At any time either of us can stop the trading, so we still have left what we didn't send and can only lose a maximum of one tiny piece, so it's very safe.",19-02-18-22-06,2,728,cryptos4pz,arw5wi

202,"> So it's some thing like a time lasp trading?

No, there is no time lapse. Ideally the trade happens in just a few seconds. The technology uses [Payment Channels](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels) which can make many secure transactions in fractions of a second for free. Again, the way to think of it is breaking something valuable into small pieces so risk is lowered during a trade. Say I have a diamond ring and you have a ruby ring and we want to trade. If we're face to face we just hand each other the rings. If I try to keep my ring you're there to cancel the trade any way you can to keep things fair. Now, imagine we're miles apart trying to do the same thing. A trade by mail is unsafe since I can try to keep both rings. Well, since cryptocurrency is digital we can break it into tiny pieces and send them anywhere in the world instantly. Combine that with payment channels and that's Atomic Swaps. :) We just trade a tiny piece at a time keeping things balanced until all pieces have been transferred. Software handles it all, so the complete process can happen in just a few seconds!

>And this can be done with any currencies?

Theoretically, yes, any cryptocurrencies with blockchain rules that support Payment Channels, the main requirement being some kind of [Timelock](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Timelock) (which Bitcoin has supported for years).

>Do both the currencies need to be capable of atomic swaps

Yes, both currencies need to be capable of a Payment Channel. Once the software is written and a protocol established one would expect any serious cryptocurrency to ensure the feature was readily available. The logical extrapolation is at some point in the future people will be able to trade any cryptocurrency (or asset such as tokens etc) directly with others basically for free, with high security, no escrow needed, and nearly instantly. That's much safer than dealing with centralized exchanges which are subject to hacks and insider theft etc.",19-02-18-22-06,2,728,cryptos4pz,arw5wi

Not sure how you come up with that, or how I would dispute it. Unless you assume that literally everyone sold after the split to the same guy?

1 - Crypto exchanging

2 - Local cash volatility

&#x200B;

The first problem is related to their laws according which you can't exchange crypto into USD. So you have to find ways to exchange crypto into cash (USD or EUR better) and keep it outside the county. 

The 2nd problem is that if your cash transfer (in their local currency) takes 2 or 3 hours, you can lose up to 30% because of inflation.

&#x200B;

That's why I would recommend them to use crypto backed lending platforms which provide European banks accounts. For example, Youhodler offers EU bank account, LTV up to 80% and USDT and withdrawal option. I think it will be the best way to avoid their current crisis.

&#x200B;

The question is: how do you manage to open an account in this type of platform with a Venezuelan passport, since most of the exchanges, loan platforms, etc. do not accept Venezuelans for this type of process to which you mention.

&#x200B;

Regarding your two previous observations, I comment, the exchange usually occurs from crypto to crypto in friendly stores with cryptocurrencies that accept payments of this type. There you avoid the need to have to resort to cash. On the other hand, although the UDS is not legal currency, 60% of the transactions occur in this type of currency currently in the streets and commerce of the country.

&#x200B;

On the second point, it is avoided first with the point previously exposed. Second, you make direct transfers between the same banks through platforms like Localbitcoins. In other words, you can exchange cryptos for cash with a buyer / seller of local currency of the same bank so that the transfer is direct and instantaneous.

&#x200B;

Finally, mining is very profitable in the country, and low profile or legal (if you prefer to register on the government website and be under your radar) is highly profitable and efficient.

&#x200B;

In particular my expenses for electricity for 6 S9 machines and pair of Nvidia 1080Ti GPUs do not reach the monthly nor 1 cent per month the ELECTRICITY MONTHLY BILL.

422,"So I did a little googling to figure out the number of transactions on Credit Cards alone. Just going to be thinking outloud for the remainder of the comment - haven't processed any errors or other thoughts, fyi. 

In 2012 it was around 24 Billion general transaction (not including businesses and travel)

In 2016 it has increased to roughly 34 billion. 

That's a 41% increase in the number of transactions, so roughly 10% increase every year, steadily. 

BCH is designed to replace those CC transactions (plus cash and debit card transactions, but we'll stick to just CC for now). 

Assuming that increase remains somewhat steady we can just increase the number of transactions per year by 10%. 

BCH should hit 21 Million in 2140 I think. That's 124 years from now. So a possible 1240% increase in the number of general CC transactions. 

from 34 Billion in 2016 - we'd hit 455,600,000,000 or 455.6 Billion transactions. At $.01 transaction fees - thats roughtly $4.5 Billion dollars in fees alone, per year. Just accounting for general CC transaction volume of 2016 vs 2140. 

This could all be super wrong, but made sense as I went through. 

You'd also have to think about the data that will be in the blockchain by then and how valuable that will be. Google alone is worth 766 Billion today, and literally doesnt charge for 99% of their services. Data mining is a huge profit. Miners of the BCH blockchain will have all of that data at their finger tips to be able to sell however they see fit. 

Just a thought though. ",19-01-21-16-46,4,1466,WonderBud,ai71h3
423,"Depends on the amount of transaction. More transactions -> higher total fees -> higher profit for miners -> more hashpower -> more secure network.

BSV and BCH (formally BCH ABC)

Essentially, no one sided with the idea that BSV was even a contender for the ticker. 

The BSV chain, though, has not put in replay protection. Meaning that if you send BCH coins from a wallet before the fork, you’d actually be sending both your BCH and BSV coins at the same time, to the same place. 

This is why you should manually split them. 

As of now there are several exchanges that will split them for you. For instanve, I sent all of my BCH to CoinEx, and after a few days they showed my balance as having both coins individually and I was able to withdrawal them individually.

Real answer here u/Scheroxx, is that hardforks aren't backwards compatible and therefore all should upgrade. It *is* just an upgrade for those who simply upgrade, those who don't want to upgrade risk either running a useless network *OR* the old network will be kept alive by a group of people and will therefore create 2 networks. 

Also, it doesn't mean hardforks are bad and it doesn't mean that is the only way to create splits. BCH forked off without BTC having a hardfork simply because there was lots of support for a larger block (and without segwit) chain. Hardforks can even keep networks healthier by ""forcing"" nodes to keep up to date with improvements.

CoinEx registration is quick. They just need an email address (you don't have to give your name, address, ID, or any KYC/AML info). CoinEx is also [owned by mining giant ViaBTC](https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/12/08/viabtc-launch-bitcoin-cash-priced-crypto-exchange), so they're not going anywhere.

* Transaction information from the November 7th tx referenced above. Ideally, you are telling Coinbase about their OWN INTERNAL transaction - you want to prove to them that they made this transaction. So if you have a reference ID or something in an email confirmation, that'd be best. Point out to them that they control the change address on this transaction (1NPBao1ApakvuAQoqG4NNxQK1zPqasuFSr)

* Transaction information from today's transaction. Again, just prove to them that they made this transaction, and show them how you accidentally sent the money to a Coinbase-controlled address (which you already have proven to them that they control).

* Suggest to Coinbase that they implement a safety check for customer-initiated withdrawals, which simply checks to see if a recipient address is one of their own, and provide a warning to the user if so.

BCH adoption is a done deal, but SV has great potential, and will be in symbiosis with Bitcoin (BCH). Craig (Satoshi) is such an intelligent and passionate leader. We are very lucky. Him and Roger are not fighting, the two chains aren't conflicting, just waiting for Jihan and his n-sync clown posse to fuck off. They are colluding in order to give the Asian scam/miner/eth complex a taste of its own medicine, by creating lies, diversion, etc.  Nobody knows what the fuck is going on, except BCH and BSV are now top dog, and miners are soon to be irrelevant, ESPECIALLY in 2020 after the next halving.  


What's most important, is that we have Bitcoin Cash, and BitcoinSV (high ledger utility, very different from BCH but it in a good way) locked down. We own soooo many of them (the real people) and people like Jihan and crap didn't even see it coming - this is what drives their bitterness and fear towards BCH more than any other coin. BSV just topped the cake and will be the last straw before it all crumbles.  


These two coins (Bitcoin and BSV), along with their small supply, will be more than enough to corner foreign markets, push their insolvent asses into into trading BCH shares (like [coinex.com](https://coinex.com) for example), and eventually render their entire cryptosphere obsolete and dangerously volatile for the end of time. Eth will die. Russian scammers will starve. Bitcoin and BSV will fulfill the roles of everyone and everything. Bitcoin for p2p electronic cash. BSV for real world scaling and robust architecture - most importantly one not run and managed by a bunch of scammy cucks.

819,"Well, go check the bitcoin.com FAQ. 

And more importantly, look for ""who keeps the private key "".

Very likely it's the website, so they should hold it all. Maybe wait until they provide fork?? ",18-12-28-14-43,1,36,ToBitOrNotToBit,aa6ktf
820,"I was in the very same position as you a few hours ago. The answer...

&#x200B;

a) If your pre-split BCH is in a custodial wallet like the one used by Coinbase and most exchange services), then youi must wait until they offer the alternate chain wallet. There is no way for you to claim your Bitcoin SV (or whatever chain they have neglected), until they support the chain, at least for the purpose of allowing you to send out your coins.

b) If you have a paper wallet, hardware wallet or a device wallet or a service for which you really control private keys, then you can claim both Bitcoin Cash ABC and SV by sending the coins to a wallet that contains a split feature with ad hoc replay protection. Edge wallet for Android and IOS is one such wallet.

&#x200B;

The process is easy with just one caveat.\*

* Create a new Edge wallet on Android or IOS.
* Send coin from a private, pre-split wallet that has not received coins after the Nov 2018 fork.
* From the Edge menu, click the SPLIT option.

That's all there is to it. The Edge wallet will automatically create a second BCH SV wallet and you will have the same number of coins in both ABC and SV wallets. They can now be sent or spent independantly.

But wait! Can the original Edge wallet still receive and split PRE-fork coins and continue to support the split function? On this point, I am not clear.

&#x200B;

\* I said that there was a caveat. I have completed a successful test with $100 import & split. But I have not yet split the rest of my BCH. I am awaiting an answer to this question:

In earlier threads, I have read warnings that each Edge wallet can only split BCH once. Therefore, it was necessary to create a second wallet after performing a small test receipt / split -- and before sending additional BCH from a pre-fork hardware wallet.

&#x200B;

Is it still necessary to create another BCH wallet before proceeding with a second receipt? I have seen conflicting information. One reader suggests that Edge can now accept pre-fork BCH into a wallet that already has split-ABC coins.",18-12-28-14-43,1,4,Ellery_Davies,aa6ktf
821,"Hey there, thanks a lot for getting back to me.

BCH is a continuation of the original Bitcoin project. As such, it implements an easy to use, cash system which should scale up to billions of users. This is an extremely motivating and exciting project for many of us. This is especially exciting for people who want personal sovereignty and who truly comprehend how the present fiat money systems most of us use, enslave us and fund terrible things like war and economic turmoil.

BTC is no longer following the ideals and goals of the original Bitcoin project. It is not promoted as a cash system and there appears to be no intention within the BTC culture to service the transactions of billions of people on chain. The BTC chain is now widely promoted as a store of value system and also as a high-value settlement system, for layer 2 systems like Lightning & Liquid.

So it depends on what you want. If you want a potentially life-changing and life-saving cash system, BCH is the coin for you. If you want what BTC offers, then that is the coin for you.",18-12-23-22-44,25,1553,hapticpilot,a8u30h

879,"First off, bch and btc are both bitcoin. Bitcoin is a protocol for p2p electronic cash, the details of which are laid out in Satoshi's white paper. BTC and BCH are two different implementations of the Bitcoin protocol.

That said, which implementation is actually better is entirely subjective. Here are some reasons why I and many others think that BCH implements bitcoin better.

- **Decentralization** One of the biggest selling points of bitcoin is the idea that you are in full control of your money. With no bank or other 3rd party controlling it, you don't have to trust anyone but yourself with what belongs to you. In btc core, they added SegWit which, without getting into technical details, allows for off-chain scaling solutions like the lightning network. The problem with LN is that it requires you to trust a 3rd party with your transactions, completely defeating one of the main purposes of bitcoin. This is (iirc) one of the main reasons that BCH originally forked.

- **Speedy Transactions and Low Fees** The reason that SegWit and LN were first introduced to btc was to attempt to fix the problem of scaling and increase transaction speed. Transactions in BTC are very slow and take a long time unless you pay a hefty transaction fee (and are often still slow even if you do). While BTC tries to solve this problem with 2nd layer solutions such as SegWit+LN, BCH uses an adjustable blocksize cap (hence BitcoinABC). This approach not only solves scaling issues, speeding up the network and lowering transaction fees, but also solves the problem of increased centralization that comes with increased block size by allowing smaller blocks to be processed as well.

- **Differing Goals** The biggest reason for the differences between the two coins is the differences in their goals. BTC is attemting to be an investment/store of value while BCH, in sticking to the original white paper, trys to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash. These goals obviously require very different things. In this regard, it ultimately comes down to what you want out of your coins.

- **Attitudes and Censorship** This point is more of a generalization and what I'm about to say does not necessarily apply to everyone in either community, but is rather an analysis of general trends that I've seen. There is a tendency for BTC forums such as r/bitcoin to be heavily censored against saying anything remotely good about bch or any other ""altcoins"", as well as a general negative attitude and closed-mindedness toward anything other than core. By contrast, bch-friendly communities such as here and r/btc tend to be much more open-minded and willing to discuss other coins. Again, I'm not saying that any of this applies to everyone in either camp, this is simply my observations.

These are some of the main reasons for me, hope this helps :)",18-12-23-22-44,8,4596,MrJoshTheEpic_,a8u30h
880,because it is the Bitcoin before the attempted compromise of the project due to the compromise of the people that control the code repo,18-12-23-22-44,6,2109,DaSpawn,a8u30h
881,"BCH is virtually free to send (avg tx fee on BCH now is around $ 0.01 and you can easily send free tx), so BCH is true peer-to-peer electronic cash.  BCH on-chain tx confirmations are faster, especially when the BTC chain sees a surge in volume when the mempool backs up.  BTC fees can get ridiculously high at times of higher volume for any users wanting an on-chain transaction to get confirmed within the next few blocks. This is due to the very small 1 MB block-size cap that BTC maintained even after the volume outgrew that cap (the 1 MB cap was put in as a temporary measure in 2010 to protect the network against spam attacks while the network was in its infancy).  

Having said all of that, BTC kept the ticker and the name, thus has far greater presence in ther market, higher demand and far higher coin value.

you don't ""change"" or ""claim"". You already own and have control.

You just need a wallet that allows you to work with your BSV. electron-cash is a good one, it works with trezor.

However when you send prefork BCH you have a problem: your transaction will be valid on BCH chain AND on BSV chain and it will most likely be ""replayed"" (copied from one network to the other), so you have to ""split"" your prefork coins.

here is a tutorial how to split: https://medium.com/@antsankov/how-to-safely-split-bch-and-bsv-coins-using-electron-cash-w-pictures-ba2d2935b4cc",18-12-20-13-39,2,2063,moleccc,a7thoz

NO, don't do it without thinking!!! you will probably send BOTH BCH and BSV if you just do it without first splitting (see my other post).

Some exchanges auto-split your coins (like kraken) and maybe coinex (not sure, anyone?). So you could use one of those exchanges. Be careful not to walk into a trap. There might be people trying to scam you offering ""split service"" or similar.

I don't know if it's fair to characterize it as a handful of multinationals.  BTC is essentially controlled by a small group of the core developers with the keys to the code repository who co-founded a company called Blockstream (Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille).  Blockstream began working on LN and its founders, for reasons that are likely a direct conflict of interest, fought to keep the BTC block-size cap at the very small 1 MB level which did not allow for any on-chain scaling while Bitcoin was increasing in popularity.  The 1 MB cap had been introduced back in 2010 as a temporary cap to protect the network against spam attacks when it was in its infancy (when spamming the network would have been incredibly cheap for anyone wanting to rock the boat). By keeping the 1 MB cap in place, the blocks began filling up regularly by early 2016, and as usage grew, backlogs ensued, thus delays in tx confirmations and increasing fees. The fees got so bad in 2017 that sending a single tx often cost over $50, sometimes closer to $100 to get it included in the next block. The conflict of interest is obvious, and the sad part is the small block size data cap stifled BTC right when it was betting very popular and had the opportunity to massively increase adoption. With utility diminished, many prospective bitcoin users lost interest, and the market subsequently declined in 2018, as we all know.",18-12-19-04-15,9,487,sph44,a7d0om

>ideal of decentralization

To me this implies that you understand/believe *decentralization* to be the end goal of Bitcoin.  This is not the case.  *Censorship resistance* is the goal and decentralization is the vehicle by which it is achieved.  I say *resistance* and not *proof* because the latter implies perfect resistance which further implies a perfect *system* of resistance and there is no such thing as a perfect system.

BSV is striving to be sound money for the world and be governed by miner vote and Nakamoto Consensus.

As you say, Blockstream has been able to wrestle control of BTC through their implementation of LN. Bitcoin mining is dominated by companies like Bitmain, and to a lesser extent, HIVE. What I'm saying is that without competition laws there is a tendency for corporate entities, like multinationals, to form monopolies.

Bitcoin is a technology, but it is also an economic system that stands in opposition to the centralized nation-state, which for the past hundred-ish years held a monopoly over the creation and circulation of money. In my view, decentralization is the goal and censorship resistance is the vehicle by which it is achieved. The social and economic purpose of Bitcoin is as important as its technical dimensions, and the growing demand for crypto is I think rooted in a profound dissatisfaction with the way our monetary systems are governed (usually toward the self-interest of state and corporate actors).

Even today as we're getting closer to 2019, most people still don't know a lot about crypto currencies let alone what a hard fork is and how many other alt coins have spawned since the 2017 bitcoin craze.

Yes, it is very confusing to those who just got into the fray because 10 years after bitcoin was born, things have changed significantly and even being out of the scene for only a year and coming back can be a daunting task indeed.

On November 15th, bitcoin cash went through a hard fork where some of the developers had stark, contrasting ideas for the future of bch. This resulted in Bitcoin cash becoming bch ABC and bch SV. (now bch ABC is referred to as the original bitcoin cash and bch SV now is being referred to just bitcoin SV).

If you had bitcoin cash in a wallet or an exchange before this fork, your bitcoin cash are entitled to an 'airdrop' or a duplicate amount of coins for bitcoin SV as well. If you had your bch on an exchange, your coins will be split for you. But if you had it in an electron cash wallet or a cold storage wallet ledger, you will need to follow their directions on how to correctly split them.

The million dollar question that people are still trying to figure out is, which of the two is going to be successful and have their coins shoot for the moon? No one knows because bitcoin itself is doing terribly these days, and when bitcoin does poorly you can pretty much say that other crypto-currencies in general do poorly as well. And when bitcoin surges, others follow. You could say that bitcoin itself is still very important in the cryptocurrency world still, even as it's technology is becoming 'clunky' in today's terms and it's only a matter of time before the media and the rest of the folks pick up on this and deem the next successor, etc...

So the best thing you can do now is sit back, get your coins split if you held on to some bch before the fork and keep watching the price flow until 1st quarter of 2019 where things might break out or some potential crypto currency might lead the pack. Or you can do what many others are doing as we speak, quietly pick and choose coins you think might be worth it some day, because right now they're all dirt cheap and it's not going to last forever.

1140,There is no advantage of quicker block packaging. If the TX is in the mempool and the pool is properly maintained/destributed than it is pretty safe to assume that the Transfer is valid and will execute. The amount of confirmation needed for an exchange is their decision. It is based on how safe is the TX in a certain block depth(how deeply buried underneath the most recent block). This is to prevent reorganisation of blocks.  If they require 10 confirmations with current circumstances than means that they want 100 minutes to pass after the TX creation so consider it safe. If you change the code and you create 10 blocks in 10 minutes  than they will raise it to 100 confirmations because they want to have a certain amount of time passed between the Output signiture  (TX creation) and the most recent block. Do you get it?

It constantly proves that the technology is evolving and catching up with the 2 years backlog on development. If you check LTC, their roadmap is just ""wait until Bitcoin does something and copy the code"". You can read these comments from their own developers. It doesn't bring anything to the table, it is missing the added value hence it's called Lite. By the way did you know that ETH was a Project created for Bitcoin? The inventor has been chased away and he created ETH and smart contracts.

1. NOBODY knows if it's a good time to buy anything. Anyone who tells you different is lying. Lots of people make their living pretending to know, but nobody holds them accountable when they're wrong. They just get to keep on making BS predictions about the future and cherry picking the times they got lucky.
2. Nobody knows what the future holds. The best ideas, and the best protocols aren't necessarily going to be the winning blockchain(s). There are a thousand factors, including merchants, investors, governments, miners, developers, awareness, ease of use, adoption, the list goes on. And nobody can quantify them all accurately.
3. You cannot ask other people to tell you what to do. Because when the price goes up or down you won't know why you own the thing in the first place. You should ONLY invest in coins because you believe they have some strong advantage and future potential.

If you own some of these I would highly recommend to learn a bit about how these keys are working so you can understand it and therefore better protect them. The book Mastering Bitcoin is a very good source of information as you can search for keywords in the PDF and can read up specific terms and their uses. I'll give you a hint and attempt to help you understand why you own all forked coins from the moment of chain split if you have the private key:

>Bitcoin’s transactions are based on the concept of spending “outputs”, which are the result of previous transactions, to create a transaction chain that transfers ownership from address to address. Our wallet has now received a transaction that assigned one such output to our address. Once this is confirmed, we can now spend that output.

So the public address(key) is where the coins are assigned to, and the private key is what you need to sign a transaction, what basically just changes the public address(key) the coin is assigned to. I won't go into details of multiple inputs and outputs, lets just stick to an example where we are sending 1BTC with 0 fee.   
That is one input of 1 BTC and 1 output of the same BTC. Since you have the private key you can sign this transaction no matter which chains they are on. So you own all the coins at the point when you are possessing your own private key. If there is a hard fork with chain split, that mean at a time there are two identical copy of the ledger with the same spendable coins but the transactions from that point will be incompatible therefore different transactions can be signed on both sides of the chains with the same Private Key.

Bitcoin itself is introducing Dandelion, which is an obfuscating feature in how transactions are broadcasted. This adds to LN privacy, because channel openings and closings are visible on the blockchain. 

IIRC it will also be impossible to know if a transaction even is normal or multisig at some point, so channel actions on BTC chain become invisible.

Note two misconceptions on splitting. 

1. Edge can only split funds if it received money before the fork or if the sending wallet sent both BCH and BSV into Edge. Exchanges are likely to only send out one of the coins. Also, if your wallet received some pure BCH before sending to Edge, that would taint the wallet and likely cause it to only send BCH to Edge. 

2. After splitting, only funds that are already in the Edge are replay protected. New incoming transactions that have both BCH and BSV are not replay protected. As long as you have some split funds in Edge, you can replay protect future incoming funds by spending your full balance back to yourself from Edge to Edge.

""We recommend consolidating your BCH into one wallet address before November 15 and making sure not to use the BCH network during the hardfork(s) planned for November 15. Consolidating your BCH into one wallet prior to the fork will make it easier to split your funds up and move funds to wallets and/or exchanges that support alternative coins after the fork takes place. Your BCH wallet(s) might contain multiple inputs with a different private key assigned to each input. Moving those inputs to one address will make it so you only have to extract one private key instead of multiple.""
